     ""I Found a Grave,"" a short story by Kate Chopin

This is a mystery, and one of the characters is a ghost. It takes place over three nights.

I opened the window and leaned against it, staring out into the night air. It was a warm autumn night; the air smelled of leaves and freshly mown lawns. I heard a click. It sounded like someone walking across the cement driveway and then running in the direction of the house. I had no doubt that someone had been in the back room of the garage, where there was no light and the dust had never been vacuumed out of the dusty shelves. I kept my window wide open. I waited. Nothing. The clock on the dining room wall said ten-fifteen. I went to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator door, and looked inside. Nothing but ice cream and old bottles. The refrigerator door clicked, and the ice cream disappeared. I knew who it was. I closed the refrigerator and opened the back door. I saw the man walk across the lawn toward the house. It was a boy, a child, probably nine or ten years old. I waited. The boy was obviously nervous, but still he moved slowly across the yard and headed for the back door. I had to be certain, so I peeked inside the garage. There, next to the large pile of metal and wood, was a small hole in the concrete where someone had been. A shovel lay nearby"

     To say that legend has a meaning to a person may be too literal.
The word legend, according to Merriam-Webster, is defined as : a person whose or something's reputation, reputation, or achievements are regarded as especially remarkable ; a person with an unblemished reputation.
As in, ‘my husband has a legendary sense of humor’.
So in that sense, legend can be used as a metaphor. But that doesn’t mean people would immediately understand. They would still think ‘he has a reputation of being lazy’. So he is still a legend as far as his reputation goes.
So when you speak of a legend, you can never speak of just someone’s reputation. You would have to include a physical feature they possess. And that physical feature makes them a legend.
Because that physical feature makes you believe they’re legendary.
So for example, when you speak of Elvis Presley, his name would be in the title. But that doesn’t mean you’d automatically assume he was legendary.
When you speak of the Dalai Lama, you would know that he’s a famous person. But that’s all he is to you. The Dalai Lama is just another person. He has no legend of his own, but he is a legend to you. Because he is well known. Because he is a holy being, and he’s a"

     A woman dreamed she walked down the street, with a strange dog by her side. The dog jumped through a window and into an old woman’s kitchen. She asked, “What is this all about?” Then the dog said, “Your husband is here looking for you. And I can take you home if you want to go with him!” The woman thanked the dog, put on her coat, and gave the dog a piece of paper. But just as the woman went outside, she spotted her husband’s car. She decided to stay, as the strange dog seemed friendly. She took a look around, and noticed that her husband was still inside the old woman’s kitchen. And the strange dog was there, too! Then the woman realized she didn’t know what to do next. She didn’t see her daughter in her house, either!

     ""Secrets"" is a short story in the genre of dark fiction. I wrote this for a school project, and I chose this topic to fit the story into what I thought was more realistic to the world we live in today. The story involves a young girl who lives in an abandoned building, and has many odd experiences in her new home. The girl also has a family secret. This secret changes her life forever. The story is based on a secret, and the theme is that secrets can change lives for the better or for the worse. 
I thought that it would be fun to include some fantasy elements into this story, such as a ghost story, a witch, and some other things. The theme of the story is that secrets change lives for the better or for the worse. I had to work hard to find some balance between the dark fantasy story, and the lighthearted feel of the writing style. In the end, I think it was a nice mix, and the students enjoyed the story.
""Secrets"" is a good story for middle schoolers to read. It is a story that involves secrets, and the characters change throughout the story. The story also has a happy ending, but it has a bittersweet flavor as the two main characters have lost a loved one. The story is a good fit for middle school students because of this element, and also because of the fantasy elements. It is recommended for grades 6 to 8.

She had everything that anyone could ever want: a warm fire, soft bed, lovely clothes, and a great book. 
She loved the way that all of her words lined up the same way in a book. It was just so pretty!

Mary loved to read and read and read. In fact, one day, after she had read every book in her house, she decided to go out to eat. 
She wanted to read in a place without books on her bed.

When she got to the restaurant, she looked at all of the other chairs and said, ""My God! Why did I ever decide to come here?"" 
But the restaurant had chairs that looked just like hers! They had the same shape and the same fabric.
Mary loved the way she could always find her chair because of the way it lined up with the other chairs.

Eventually, the restaurant was crowded and she needed to sit down in a seat that was not like her chair.
She was very annoyed by this, because her books lined up so neatly on her bed, but there were no chairs that looked like her bed.

The sun was shining brightly on the crisp, white grass. It felt so nice to be outside, not spending every minute inside on a warm, sunny day. The small children played in the yard; they ran, jumped, skipped, and threw snowballs.

Their laughter filled the air. Each of them was so happy and content, even though they all had slightly different reasons for their joy.

“The snow is so soft and pretty!” cheered Jack, who was five years old.

“I like the snow because it’s white and fluffy, and I feel like a superhero flying through the air,” said the shy, quiet five-year-old named Sally.

“I love the snow because it looks like magic!” giggled the rambunctious, five-year-old named Kevin.

by Elizabeth ""Bee"" Warren, age 10, Cambridge, MA

There is a tree in the woods and a boy who hates it. He throws stones at it and calls it a bad name and then throws his shoe at it. One day he was throwing his shoes at it when a big wave crashed on the beach and they all fell into the water. The boy jumped into the water, but his shoe was still on the tree. He was afraid of going back to get it. He swam across the pond where the rocks and the rocks were very large and the rocks could hurt him if he fell into them. Finally he made it to the tree that his shoes were on. Then he grabbed his shoe and was really happy because it was his favorite. The boy's favorite color is red and he loves his red shoes. The next day a big storm hit the beach and a lot of the rocks fell into the water. The boy's red shoes were in the water and the boy was really mad. The boy ran up the hill and shouted really loud to scare the storm back and get his shoes. When the storm had gone away, the boy ran back to get his shoe. He climbed up the tree and when he put his foot on it, it felt really wet. He looked down and it was wet but his shoe wasn't on. The boy ran down to the beach but his shoe was gone.

I had never seen an island before, so she gave me a brief description. As she said, the island is not flat or square. Its shape is irregular, it moves on the ocean, and its name is different depending on the place: it is the island of privacy and solitude. The island is also called the desert island.

																																																																																										
    I decided that I would build my island. I did not know what kind of island to build, but after thinking for a while, I thought that I could build an island with a river running through it and with trees surrounding it. I would also make it very beautiful so that everyone will want to live there.

     I had always dreamt of going to Hogwarts, but I knew I would be a failure there, since I had a short temper. I would always get lost, since my family had trouble using directions and I would get easily frustrated with the rules that Hogwarts had. After all, being a teenager is hard enough, but when I was also a witch with very short tempers, Hogwarts seemed to have even more rules. But I decided to go there anyway. My parents had made me go, so I would get to find out whether Hogwarts was better or worse than I had expected. I started searching for Hogwarts, but everything I tried to do led me back home, which was always a joy to me. I would always take longer getting to Hogwarts than I usually took to get anywhere else. I knew that it would be better for me to try another strategy instead of just sitting around at home wishing I was at Hogwarts. I remembered going into the kitchen to grab the last of the sweets before going out, and that is what made me think of my strategy. As I looked at the wrappings in the trash, I thought, “If I eat one of these sweets now, I will probably be fine. It will probably not be too strong, and it will get me home faster.” That was how I knew I needed to try the chocolate. It was the best strategy I knew to avoid being sent back home. I took the chocolate out of the wrappings, and went"

     The challenge is a bit boring, but it’s still a very easy challenge. I don’t usually post “easy challenges” on this blog, but this challenge is actually fairly easy, and can be done in about 15 minutes. It’s the topic word, “Challenges,” that I find difficult. I don’t know why. The prompt, “challenges”, is simple and easy to understand.
“Challenges” is the word for your story. It is a verb in this story. There is a direct object in your story for “Challenges”. The first two sentences of your story should explain what kind of challenge the story’s focus is about. That should give you an easy topic sentence. Your challenge should be “how do I choose a challenge to work on?” Your challenge should be a noun, and you should have an adjective describing it, and a verb describing the task that the adjective describes. I’m just not sure why I find “challenges” so difficult, but I do, and I’m sure it’s not because the challenge is easy.
I don’t normally post easy prompts here on this blog, but the theme word, “Challenges,” is one I find difficult to come up with a challenge for.

     The Moon was full, but it was not the only thing full. Three beautiful maidens of the light were standing with their backs to it. The sky was full of stars, but the Maidens were staring at the Moon. All of them had a bright, shiny golden band around their neck. And all three of them held bright red apples with bright silver teeth. The maidens were waiting for the Moon to be full again, just for them. They had a promise to keep. Then the maidens saw the Knight coming. He was tall and strong and his feet were as yellow as the grass in the fields. All the grass was yellow, but the Knight had a red band around his left foot. This was the foot he used for stepping down the stairs. Then he arrived at the garden. There was a beautiful tree with golden apples on it. But instead of taking one, he looked around the garden. He looked at the beautiful flowers and the green grass, and he thought about the promise he had made. He knew the Moon was full, but he also knew the Moon's promise was broken. He looked at the three maidens, with their shining golden bands, and he thought about how the promises broken were worse than the full Moon. The Knight then walked away from the garden. But the maidens could hear his footsteps go through the grass. The Moon was not the only thing that was full.

     Jenny was a sorceress. Her powers were so powerful that even she had trouble believing it. She didn’t need to see with her eyes or hear with her ears to know that something amazing and frightening was happening in her house. The house seemed to be glowing. A small flame, a flickering light, was burning in the fireplace. Jenny was surprised to see that her husband, Frank, had already dressed for his journey into the wilderness. As he bent over to secure his leather pouch, the flame began to glow even brighter. Jenny had to shout in order to be heard. “Don’t go, Frank! Don’t go!” Frank looked at her as if she had gone mad. He was about to protest when Jenny’s voice became a scream, and the house began to shake with an earthquake. Frank was caught in an earthquake. He could not tell Jenny to stand up and go to the door. And when the ground opened beneath him, he could not hold onto the roof as it crumbled around him. Frank was swept away in the swirling cloud of dust, and Jenny stood for a long moment stunned by what had just happened. She had heard the earthquake. Now she could see it.

     Dragon. That's all I needed to say.
Dragon, the big green scary monster that ate people, slept in trees and spit fire. That's what my classmate and I thought after watching one too many cartoons. Dragon was bad, dragon was good. Dragon was big, dragon was little. Dragon was hairy, dragon was not. Dragon was fat, dragon was thin. Dragon was long, dragon was short. And what does a dragon see? Well my classmates and I didn't want to find out.

Dragon. And the word dragon doesn't just mean a beast that sleeps in trees and feeds on people.
The word dragon can be used to describe any creature that is feared or dangerous. That's why a dragon can be a scary beast but it can also be a small and delicate creature.
Dragon as a word can also be used to describe a mythological creature. It can even be used to describe a mythical creature that is more about what the artist wanted to convey, rather than what is really true to the animal. Some of these mythical creatures, such as the snake, the horse or the unicorn, have many things in common. Some of these similarities include having scales, being reptilian, living in areas where people don't want to live, being a threat to the status quo and so on.
Other mythical animals have very little in common with their modern counterparts. For example, the bear is often used to represent a king because of it's size,"

     The light bulb had been with us for centuries. Even so, I couldn’t quite believe it would be finally changing so that we could see in the dark. Suddenly the streets of our village would be brighter and the nights shorter. Of course the new light bulbs weren’t easy to find, and the city shopkeepers kept going out of business because of it. But eventually the merchants had learned how to make money from the invention. The light bulbs were bright and easy to use. We’d always had candles on our tables, but at night the brightness from the bulbs gave our tables and our homes a sense of light that was so much better than what we’d always had. The bulbs even helped us understand the nature of darkness. The darkness was no mere background – a curtain between us and all that was. The world was always there in the world. But now it would be more clearly seen. The bulb change had given people something new and useful to focus on. And as people worked together to discover the new brightness, they found that they could even have fun and be a little playful. The bulbs allowed us to see the full range of color in the dark. We had always had black and white TV, but there was no longer any excuse for boring black and white movies. The colors in those movies had not existed until they were painted into the light of the bulbs. The new bulbs gave a new sense of wonder to the night. We could see"

She told her friends that the magic was even more powerful than before. They all wanted to go inside the castle. The problem was that Dorothy was alone, so they wanted to ask her permission. Dorothy said that she did not need permission, because there is only one thing that she wanted. She just wanted to see a person with wings, so that she could say hello to him or her. When they asked her who she wanted to see, she said she wanted to see a person with wings. The other person on the other side of the castle said she was very lucky to see someone like that. The door of the castle was suddenly opened for them. It was actually a door that led to a dungeon. They all immediately ran away and tried to hide. Dorothy was very excited and said she wanted to stay there all day. As the day went on, the castle was always getting smaller and smaller, until the light from a light was never seen again. It was actually just Dorothy on a roof. She tried to ask the dragon for help, but he was not there. Dorothy said she wished she could go to sleep until the sun came up in the sky, but the dragon told her that if she did that, she would disappear forever. That is when Dorothy went to sleep.

He looked at the two galaxies from different locations. In the middle of the night, the scientists saw something moving across the sky.

     Robots were the subject matter of our first meeting when I taught sixth grade English at the Community Public School in New York. I was thrilled to have a topic worthy of my teaching skills. It felt good that robots are a favorite topic of the students because they enjoy science. It was my task to use this theme to help my students think about themselves and the world around them. I decided to use the robot story from Little Women by Louisa May Alcott to help my students explore their own identities.
The story begins in the beginning of February. Jo March is a very bright girl who is always at the top of her class. One day, her mother Mary calls and tells Jo that she has some terrible news and it is about the death of her father. Jo rushes home and begins to think about her own mortality. Soon, she begins to realize she is much like her father. Jo is not happy with this realization, and she tries to fix her problems through other means. However, there comes a point in the story when Jo realizes that her family and friends are very important to her, and she feels a stronger connection to them. She feels that she can trust her family and friends, and Jo is able to be comfortable with the rest of her family.

     It was the summer after high school, and I had just finished my senior year. I’d spent most of my time working for a construction company and going on many trips. My father always said that after high school was the best time in your life, and he was right. I’d been around the world and met many wonderful people.
As usual, I’d gone on a four-day weekend to a place where the sun never set. This year, though, I’d traveled to Florida, which was just across the Gulf of Mexico from my home town of Gulfport. It was a sunny, hot, windy afternoon when I left. My father was going to accompany me to this wonderful place. I packed everything I wanted for this week-long vacation into a small suitcase I’d kept in my bedroom for the past six months.
A few days later, my dad and I took a bus from the Port of Gulfport into Tampa, which was an hour away. We spent the next couple of days there exploring downtown, shopping, eating, and sight-seeing. In the evening, we caught a bus back to Gulfport. The trip cost the same as a flight, but we got to see more of the places we wanted to see.

If he did succeed, he would be given the title of Emperor.  This is the way that we got promoted as people.  I think that it would help to have a code like that.

    But, in this empire, we had some other ideas.  We did not want people to confess if they did not succeed.  We wanted them to keep trying.  That is why the code was different.  And that is the difference that I think that I can make.

The wise man worked hard.  He did his best and even if he did not succeed, he still would be promoted.  If he was still promoted, then he could be Emperor.  But if not, then he would at least be King.  That is why he always worked hard, so he could always be a King.

So in our kingdom, we had two kinds of rulers.  They had to wear a robe and they had to wear a crown.  In other words"

     The detective sat behind a desk with a pencil, a pen, and a file. It was Monday morning and it was time to start the week's work. Every morning he would start the day by writing down clues he had received. Some of the clues were very unusual while others were fairly common. Each day he would use a different tool to collect clues. Each tool that he used was special in some way and each special tool had a name.
 The detective's first tool was a flashlight. Using the light from his flashlight, the detective would take all the clues and put them in his file. As a rule, clues were found between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
 Next the detective used a magnifying glass. Using the light from the magnifying glass, the detective would use a pencil to write down clues. The clues were always written very small and in a very obscure way.
 The detective's third tool was a stapler. Using the stapler, the detective would staple the clues together in a particular way. Using a specific stapler for each clue was also a rule.

     This story is one of the first I wrote as a young writer. It was about the ghost of the deceased girl from the woods and all the mischief she did in her old age, and how the spirit of the old woman finally forced her to go back to the grave. I really liked it, and I'm glad that my readers did, too!
""I can't wait to see you, Uncle Peter!"" cried Sarah. ""I'll take some treats with me and you can feed them to the ghost!""

""That's a good idea,"" said Uncle Peter, chuckling. ""But I'm afraid that ghostly creature is not a happy soul. When she dies, the only thing she'll have with her is this box of chocolate! Her name is Sally, and she was a rich lady who died in the early days of the Great War. She left the box to my nephew, Peter, in her will, and now he has to feed her chocolate from now on.""

""Uncle Peter,"" said Sarah, ""I've been waiting all morning to find out what's inside that box!""

""Yes,"" said Uncle Peter. ""I hope she'll be content to sit in her chair when she dies.""

""But Uncle Peter,"" Sarah called.

Uncle Peter ran over to the bed where Sally had been lying in her death bed. And there were signs that she hadn't been sleeping well since the night before.

     The witch was not happy with the world because it had gotten darker with each day. She wanted to know the meaning of this world and to learn the secret of good or evil. Each day, she had an argument with God who told her that everything is alright. The witch then had a word with people who helped her in her journey and she would punish them if they had harmed her. When she reached the end of her journey, she would find out the secret. If it was good, she would thank them. If it was bad, she would curse them. The witch was ready for the challenge but she was not ready to listen to what God had to say. She had a word with God and she was ready to accept his decision.

     I sat in the backyard of my parents’ house one sunny afternoon on a swing in the shade, smoking a cigar. My mother passed by, picking up some dry goods that had been delivered to our house. I was looking up at a beautiful sunflower blooming in my parent’s garden. There was no sign of any zombies.

I looked at myself, reflected in my reflection in the patio door, and wondered what life would be like if zombies hadn’t come along. I was an adult, but I was still a kid in many ways. Sure, I had a job at the local hospital, but I loved my job and felt like I could work there for years. I was also divorced and, as far as I knew, alone. The summer before, I had been introduced to my co-worker, Jane. I liked her a lot, and she said she felt the same way. At lunch one day, Jane pulled a chair out next to mine. She made eye contact and smiled and then started telling me about her life.

“I’m divorced. I have no kids. I live in a rented apartment that’s too small for me and my two dogs. I haven’t had much luck with men, but I’m open to new experiences. My best friend is my dog, and it’s amazing how fast I can find joy when I forget to worry about something else."

     The angel of death was once the servant of Death and he was a very cruel person. He was sent by the Lord to kill everyone, but he didn't succeed and he regretted for it ever since.
The Lord gave him a second chance. He told him to deliver to mortals only the people who deserve it, like a righteous judge. And if he does not find them, he must turn them back to the right hand of God. This time, the angel took their lives. The Lord gave him a third chance. He told him to go to a poor widow and give her her son back. Otherwise, he must turn him back to the right hand of God. The angel couldn't deliver the boy because he was lost somewhere in the city, and it was impossible to find him. But at that moment, the Lord returned to heaven and was happy for all the time he spent with his son.
In the end, Death was very sorry for what he did, and he decided to love everyone, no matter if he is good or bad. He had a son, whom he was very proud, and he raised him to be a good person.

     This is a sample of a long story from a 6th grade class at the University of Michigan. There are other examples of class writing, but this is the one that struck me as best-written, as it focuses mostly on language, as does the prompt. The story deals with the question of whether a teacher can really control or influence the students he or she teaches.
The teacher's job is very difficult. He or she must be both a role model and a teacher, inspiring and challenging without overstepping boundaries. He or she also must help his or her students find success with the material. The teacher is in a delicate position, the students in a very tough situation, and the teacher can't control either of them. But one thing he does have control over is his classroom. His classroom is a fortress; inside is a magic ring, around which are walls of steel, with barbed wire and razor wire in the gaps. The students can't get out, so they're safe. And they're not allowed to leave. The teachers have all the power, and the students have all the fear. It's a good arrangement. The student's only hope for escape is through the teacher, who seems to be an evil figure to the students, but maybe that is because the teacher is just like the other teachers. The teacher could be anyone, at any age. So maybe the students are the real evil ones, or maybe it's the way they're being taught.

     Her mother had died in a tragic accident and ever since she had been haunted by her own inability to prevent it.

She didn’t just grieve the loss of her mother, her father had taken it upon himself to become the “manager” of her grief, acting like a professional to deal with his grief.

He was still a very loving father, but his approach to his own death was far different from when his wife had died. He was ready to live again.

His daughter had grieved silently, in an attempt to not disrupt the rest of her family.

She never learned what she needed to about her parents death, which was the source of her nightmares.

She wished she could have one day, in the company of her father, to learn what happened. She was missing a whole part of her family’s history.

She was grateful for the time she did have with her mother, but missing the rest would always be something that hurt her.

     Legend (or, as the French would call it, Legendre), which is the name of a certain class of men from the Middle Ages, has been in the media more often than it should have been. People love to tell how legends influenced their lives in a dramatic way.  Legends also have their own cultural references, but those references are not as popular. For instance, ""Honey Badger don't give a f***!"" is more popular than ""Sire, I've just been kicked in the nuts!"".
But why, as a society, do we seem to love telling stories about legends the way we don't love telling stories about, for example, famous scientists? The difference in popularity between the two can be explained by the common perception of science as a ""pure"" subject. It seems easier to believe a scientist created an invention instead of a man of legend, even though the reality is usually the opposite.
In this project, you are asked to create a short story about one of the following themes: a historical figure, a mythical figure, a scientific figure, or the life of a normal person. Your task is to generate a story using the given prompt: ""Legend"".

It was a cold morning and, as usual, there were snowflakes swirling in the air. The streets were dark and quiet. As she wandered through the town, she stopped at a beautiful wedding venue.

And the ghost would tell that secret to Edgar Allan Poe.

And there were the paintings of ghosts.
In that old, dusty room, Edgar Allan Poe sat and he looked at the pictures. He looked at the ghosts’ faces.
And he saw their secrets, too.

     “The Quest”

Sophie was the daughter of a nobleman. She had to be content with her father’s life and its limitations because of her beautiful and rich stepmother. Even her name, Sophie, was derived from a name her father had once used before marrying the beautiful woman.

The stepmother was cold and cruel, and had no respect for her stepdaughter. The two rarely spoke, and their relationship resembled that of a man and his servant. Sophie felt that she was trapped, and yearned for the freedom of a country life, where she could be herself and meet new people. She longed to learn to speak Italian, which was not only the language of the peasantry, but the language of art as well.

The rich stepmother spoiled Sophie as if she were her own daughter. But there was no way Sophie could be happy within her father’s life, and she resolved to go her own way.

One fine afternoon, her father summoned the servants and invited them all to dinner. Sophie left the room to go shopping for a necklace, leaving her father, her stepmother, and the rest of the household to eat in silence.

Later that evening, Sophie had forgotten her necklace at home, but was so sad when she thought about the fact that she had broken her father’s heart that she felt she would never be able to forget.

     The main myth that the kids were going to talk about today was the myth about the big bad wolf, a myth about the dangers of fire and what not. They were all set to talk about that and explain to their teacher that it was just that, a myth. Of course, that never happened, because there was a little more to that story. But let's all hope that's what happens to our teachers today.
    I know that the teachers of tomorrow have it hard enough trying to figure out how to prepare for the new Common Core standards for reading. As you know, I just came back from the state education conference and we're trying to think of ways to help. In fact, we're looking to hire an education consultant to do some research and find out what we can do as a state to help our teachers with Common Core. And I know that our teachers are working so hard to find new ways to teach to the needs of the 21st century students. So I have to say, as the governor, I want to commend the superintendent of public schools and his staff for really thinking outside the box and finding a way to get all of these teachers together to talk and share ideas about the standards, and how it's affecting what our students learn, because, quite frankly, it's having a big impact.

     Kathy was trying to sleep when she heard a strange noise coming from outside. “Who is that?” she whispered to her daughter Jennifer. “It must be someone who lost a coin,” Jennifer replied. Kathy quickly got dressed and went downstairs to investigate. It was only then that she realized the sound she heard was not from a coin but from a hungry ghost. “We have to do something now,” Kathy said, “We can’t let it go hungry for too long.” So they decided to hide the ghost and invite it into their house for dinner. “We must hide it very quietly,” Kathy said. “First, I will need to get the ghost something to eat.” She brought her daughter to the refrigerator, which was packed with leftover food. “Let me take a look at what we have.” She checked the list and noticed that they had leftover pizza, cheese sandwiches, and apple pies. “What if the ghost is allergic to apples?” Kathy worried. “I’ll have to look in the pantry.” So she put on her gloves, picked up a bag of apples, and quickly went back upstairs. “There are a lot of apples in this bag,” she told Jennifer. “Don’t get too excited,” Jennifer cautioned. “I don’t know what kind"

     A hero is anyone who is admired for their valor. His valor could be either bravery or knowledge. These stories could show the hero struggling with one or both problems.  I think the second hero has a harder time. He has to struggle through his fears and weaknesses to figure out his place in a world that does not value him for what he has to offer. The first hero seems to have more self-esteem and self-worth. The first hero has to overcome his fears and do his best. The second hero, on the other hand, had those qualities thrust upon him, and is unable to find himself in the midst of this great struggle.  One could say that the first hero has already accepted himself. The second hero is in the process of doing so. While the first hero has not accepted himself, he still has the ability to face his fears and weaknesses. He could be the hero in the story since this is the theme that he seems to have to solve. But, that leaves out the most important aspect of his character, which is self-acceptance. It seems to me that he would be able to be the hero by overcoming himself. But that would lead to more questions than an answer.Two boys were born into the same family. One had a mother who was beautiful and wealthy. The other had a mother who was ugly and poor.

     The tales of Dazie the Wizard were once a fixture of London's streets, but now all that's left are the stories that still remain untold. Every year on the day of the wizard's birthday, he would hold court in the Tower, and grant the wish of the person that won a competition. But every year the crowds get smaller, until now, there's barely anyone in attendance, because the wizard has retired to his tower. And now that the contest is over, nobody's got much interest in seeing it continue. That is until a man called Thomas comes to the tower one day and asks the wizard to grant his wish, which is to be reunited with his daughter, who went missing last year. The wizard grants Thomas' wish, but not without a price, as the price for granting the wish is to have to listen to his every whim for a year. The only problem is that the wizard has a list of demands, and the only ones he cares to hear from Thomas are the tales of his wizardly exploits in the past. As Thomas begins telling him stories, he starts to realize that these tales are actually much more valuable than his money, because these are the real stories that no one has heard since the times of the Great Wizard himself. So Thomas begins telling them to the wizard, hoping that his story might give him some answers to the questions that he's always had.

The steam was rising from the boiler with every beat of the engine. It roared loudly through the train as it clanked into the station, carrying the entire school into a day at the seaside.
In front of the students, there stood the captain, dressed in a blue suit. His long white hair glowed in the light of the setting sun. He had been travelling by ship for many months, all the way to the English seaside.
“Are you all ready for your voyage?” the captain asked.

“I am,” said a student in the back of the carriage.

“You are my most trustworthy pupil,” the captain told him. “You can count on your life to be spared if something happens.”

The student was relieved that he would be spared, but felt sorry for the others. If anything had happened, it would be their fault.
He could tell that his fellow passengers in the carriage were also nervous.

“We’re setting off to the English seaside. You should be excited and happy. I know I am!” the captain shouted into the carriage. “Now everyone, put your hands over your hearts and take a deep breath!”

     For a day, artifacts are everywhere, the things in people's lives, whether they're physical things or memories, or even the words. They're a part of all our memories, but at the same time they can create a world of their own, or a new world. It's always something that is both interesting and something that needs attention. They can represent the past, present, or future. They have both an importance and an irrelevance.
I chose a word, artifacts, because the topic is about the things we find in other people's lives and relationships. The focus of the question is that even if we don't realize it, the artifacts that we create in our own lives can influence and change the people we're in a relationship with. These pieces of history become part of who we are.
For this, I wrote a story about a young couple's wedding day, and how one of them feels. It's a story about the first time you're married, how you feel, and how your partner makes you feel. There's a lot of emotion, and the artifacts are a mix of everything. It's an old-fashioned story, but a story about how it's all about the ceremony and all about the emotions that can be connected.
The story is about a couple's first time. The way they look into each other's eyes, and how excited they both are. They are young, and in love. They hold hands, and they kiss"

""They are any animals which are large enough to stand upright, are agile enough to avoid getting stepped on, and are dangerous enough to make you think twice before you touch them.
""First of all, a beast can be any animal with legs; or, a creature which can sit upright without much effort, for example, a donkey, a horse, a goat, a camel, a cow, a deer or a goose. Secondly, a beast must be one of these three types. They don't have to be the same type. We will choose an example from each one.

They were guardians of a group of seven guardians who resided in one of the Guardians’ towers. All seven guardians were the same age – 80. They wore black uniforms, and all of them carried weapons. One guardian was on the ground, another was in a tree, and the other five were in the tower. The tower was made of stone. It was made of red, black and green stones, all of which were big. All of the guards lived on the top, apart from one, and there was one that wasn’t a guardian at all. The door of the tower was made of brass. The tower was very high, with a height of 100 feet and it was more than 80 feet around. In the center of the tower was an iron fireplace, which was always cold.

There was no light to the floor. The walls of the stairway were also made of stone. There were no windows that looked outside of the tower.

He was carrying the brown sack in which he'd taken her to the beach and she was wearing a green dress and a yellow cap. He'd spent over two years searching for it and they'd finally met on the beach.

He'd never seen anyone like her and he knew he'd married the wrong person. He'd thought back and thought he was going to change his mind but she'd smiled at him and he'd known it was too late. Then she'd turned her eyes to the sack and said, ""Let's go.""

He'd taken her out to the desert where they spent two days looking for the treasure he'd stolen. They'd found it but now there were no more adventures for them. He hoped the treasure would bring luck to their marriage.

He opened the sack and found a beautiful dress, a pair of gold sandals, gold bracelets, a gold watch and a bag with a yellow and green striped ribbon inside it. He'd wrapped the package and put the box of jewels in his pocket.

He hoped she'd never know about the treasure and they could walk back to the city quietly. They'd married and then his friends took him out to"

     The dragons had just finished eating some food and rested for the night. They liked to sleep in the mountain when it was not raining so that they could be protected from the rain. On a nice moonlit night, the two dragons were very happy to rest. The dragons were very large and hairy creatures. They had very long necks and powerful tails. The dragon on the right side was slightly bigger and the dragon on the left was slightly smaller. They rested in the middle of the mountain, the dragon on the right was sleeping on a rock while the dragon on the left was resting on some leaves. As the moon shone down onto the dragon on the left, he opened one eye to see if it was safe to fly out of the mountain. It was, but he was too lazy to open the other eye so he closed it to save energy. The dragon on the right, although the same size, had opened both of his eyes and was peeking out to see what his friend was doing. Suddenly, the dragon on the right flew across the mountain and away to the sea. He saw that his friend was a bit scared and that he was moving. The dragon on the left tried to wake up but did not have much energy so he closed his eye and fell asleep again. He was very lazy so he just took his nap. The moonlight shone on the two dragons, showing them in a beautiful light. The dragon on the left looked at the dragon on the right, and whispered something"

     The moon looked down on a dark and empty forest. The forest felt dark. The moon looked down and smiled, and everything turned to light and warmth. The sun came up and the forest was light and happy, and no one was around to care. The birds were singing happily, and the sun looked down and smiled at the forest. It felt light and warm and happy as well, and no one saw the bright light and smiled back. They all thought that this was not fair. They looked down and realized that their eyes looked different than usual, and they looked up and noticed that their hair were shorter than usual and they looked around for other people, but none of them were there, because it was all dark and gloomy and cold, and everyone was dead. The sky was black, the trees were grey and white. The moon was bright, and all was right in the world again, until the light was gone. The light was dark.

     He woke up with a start, as it turned out that he was still in his armor.  He felt relieved and went on to shower. Once he was dressed and ready, he stepped out of his room to where the sound of drums could be heard. He looked out of his window and saw soldiers going into the castle to attack. He knew that in that moment his castle would be in danger. Then he ran out to the marketplace.  He saw the soldiers walking towards the castle.  He knew what they wanted. But how can he fight back? He had no weapon that he could use. He could not kill. All he could do was hiding. So he ran to the forest. There was no where for him to hide. As the soldiers approached, he started to cry. He had to find a way to escape the soldiers. How? Why?  Where?  Why?  Who?  He tried to find an answer, but all he got was a riddle. The riddle was 'Where is the shelter, from the storm?', but how would he figure it out. He had no answers to it.

     The lights dimmed, the music stopped, and the galaxies in the sky turned their light and warmth inward toward themselves, toward the stars and the planets and ourselves.
And then the light in the sky exploded, leaving the galaxies silent, and a deep silence followed. The music stopped, the galaxy turned it's light inward and the stars and the planets turned their light and warmth inward as well, toward themselves.
And then, as one, we turned our light and warmth inward as well and the darkness turned away. We were so filled with light and warmth we could no longer feel the darkness around us. We were filled with wonder, peace, and love that filled the universe with song. And so we left our light and warmth on that quiet, silent night and, when the universe had faded to quiet, the galaxies turned their light outward in all directions, toward the star-filled night, toward the planets, toward the universe. And that, too, turned inward into our hearts and minds. The light of the universe flowed into our being.
And so we learned how to turn our light inward. We learned how to find the inner silence. We learned how to find peace. And the stars and the galaxies and the universe all looked forward, toward the dark night, and toward us and the new light and peace that we had found.
That, I think, is what is meant by the words ""turning inward and turning outward."" That's why I turned inward and"

They were responsible for the physical safety of the citizens of the city and for protecting it from monsters. In particular, they guarded the human families who lived there. They had never had to face a monster, but they needed to be prepared for anything. There was a rumor that an army of monsters had attacked the city at some point. Nobody knew exactly where they were or why they came, but the Defenders knew that they needed to protect the citizens. That was what they were good at. The robots were all very similar. They had big, bulky bodies and big, bright yellow lights. They moved quickly, but were very delicate. They were very accurate with their shots.

     The dark, misty forests where warriors were born are now mostly only wooded and abandoned land. The mighty warriors in this forest were warriors before anyone called them so, and were once called as they are today: warriors. The first ones to wander the forests, where they could hide from enemies from both human and non-human creatures. The first ones who were strong enough to hold their own against foes who, up until a short while ago, they would have had no trouble dealing with. Now, however, they must fend off attacks by beings unknown to the living and unknown to even their allies in the forest.
   
    Warriors are no longer a rare sight in the forest, as the creatures of the forest have grown much weaker in the recent years, and most of them are still around even today. These creatures once fed on the warriors that lived in the forest, and it used to be very common to see such a creature emerging from the trees. But now, when those same trees are starting to lose their leaves with the approaching autumn, it is more and more difficult to spot those creatures emerging out of the shadows.
   
    But a lone warrior still roams the forest, ready to do his duty for his allies, and against his enemies. In the ancient days, the warriors used to wear different skins, but the skins are no longer available to them to use as clothing. They can no longer use the weapons they had"

He wondered if he would now have to wait until they were old before they could visit him. He hoped that he would never become too old to visit, and wondered if his new immortality would be something to be celebrated or something to worry about. He realized that his friends had, in fact, always been immortal and had never noticed. His parents would not be too happy if they knew.

He wore no shirt and no shoes and the smell of fresh sweat was on him.

Everyone stood there in silence and the detective felt himself grow dizzy. The light felt bad in his eyes and the room felt too dark. He felt dizzy all over. There was blood on his shirt. He felt like he was falling. And then he woke up. He knew it was a nightmare. But what were dreams about? He wondered, and then he sat up in bed.

The witch had three spells she could give out. The first was called the ring of fire: any one who touched the ring would suffer horribly. The second spell was the death touch: it had no target but if the touchee knew it was coming it was a very painful death. The last spell was the potion of death: it gave instant death, no one could feel any pain. Grandfather said that at first the mice were scared of the old witch, but she took pity on the mouse's baby and let it live. When it grew old it told its son the truth of what had happened to the baby and in that way the baby had become a great and wise wizard. Grandfather said that when the witch had finished her spell the mouse ran over to a bush and hid itself, the baby hid its head in its mother's arms and the witch died. But the baby was frightened and ran to the witch and hit her in the face with its nose. In that way the witch died. Grandfather said that his grandfather had told him that he had never seen his grandmother weep. After that the old witch's spells could not do their magic and her power was very weak.

All the dead have turned into zombies; they walk, talk, and think just like humans used to, and they love eating brains. One group of zombie hunters find themselves in the midst of an epic battle in the small English town of Wapping, a place they have never visited before, or had to face. They had no idea that a zombie massacre was happening in the area, and they find themselves at odds with other hunters. When the local police officer joins the fight and becomes a human zombie, he decides to kill off all the zombies at once instead of giving them a chance to get into an uproar and attack him. The other hunters follow his example until they run out of bullets. All of a sudden, police officer, zombie, and human are fighting in the streets, and the human has to kill the zombie to save himself. At least the dead have a higher standard than the zombie hunters; they don’t seem to mind that the human is now a zombie, but they definitely don’t like this person, and they do not trust him or her at all. This human survivor may have finally found a new group of people who may be able to help him in his fight against the undead. The zombie hunters must now find a new plan, and their old hunting group may have to find some new members, because the zombie plague is spreading throughout the world and soon it may be"

     As I stepped into a superhero costume, I heard a voice come from a television set. ""Welcome to my house, Superman, my very own hero."" I thought the voice was odd but accepted this and got into my costume. As I got ready, I thought of all the times I'd seen him around but knew he was hiding something. As I entered the front door, the TV showed a picture of a superhero walking on the moon. The TV turned on and I saw I'd been watching a superhero movie. I knew that I was meant to see that movie because I knew that my mom wasn't watching it. When I entered the house, I immediately spotted my mom and her boyfriend on the couch. Her boyfriend was reading a newspaper and I wondered why he was reading it. I thought that he was doing it to avoid seeing the movie he had just seen. I was trying to figure out a way to stop him from reading the paper and getting the clue that I was wearing a costume. As I approached him and asked him about the movie, he said ""Oh, just some guy going on super hero adventures."" Then he looked at me and asked ""Are you the super hero?"" I quickly smiled and said ""Of course I am, I'm the Superman!"" He looked me up and down, and said ""That's not how you wear your costume, you look like a super villain."" It was now my job to figure out how I could change so I could act like a"

     In a moment, the four of them will die.

They are young men – they have long, silvery hair and eyes that gleam with excitement and fear, as their shadows fall on the walls of their cave.

A spark of electricity shoots through the air, momentarily lighting up the wall ahead of them. In a flash, all four are struck with fear – of death, but most of all, of what lies ahead. For they are about to make a journey through time.

Time. They are about to begin traveling through time.

Nowhere in the world has time ever existed in a linear manner. Everywhere in the world, it has always been different. Each place has its own sense of time, so that sometimes there are the seasons, and other times it is hot and humid, and other times it is cold and frosty. And each person is different, too – some have long, silvery hair, while others have short, spiky hair.

The four friends, like all of humanity, were born into this time, that place, and will die here. They do not know about the time machines. They do not know about the travel through time. Their only knowledge of those things comes through their parents, and the teachers, and the books they have read. But today, they are about to change all of that.

The cave in which they sit is quiet, except for the crack of a snake’"
