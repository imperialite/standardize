The week before his wedding he started to do some things around the house. He painted the walls and the floor. He also gave the house a new furniture. As the day came, he was ready for his big day. Paul arrived at the house early and helped Harry with the preparations for the wedding. The people arrived and Harry knew that his wedding would be very successful.
As the day ended, the guests started to leave. But Paul told him that they needed to have some drinks first. They went to the pub for a drink and then headed back to the house.

     The day began like all the others. Einon had worked hard for the royal treasury and earned a bit of money. That's why he was dressed well. He had been a king's page for many years. He always loved it when the king came to visit his kingdom. That day the king was coming to have a feast and to meet some of his subjects. Einon looked so handsome. He wore a light blue cloak with a golden pin in the middle. He also had a silver sword at his right side and on his left he had a beautiful golden helmet. But he was not very famous among the people, because he was too quiet and a bit shy. 
    
    The king was tired because he had worked very hard for the last months. But he still enjoyed all the events that his kingdom held. The people were the most important thing for him and he was always glad when they were happy. The sun shone warmly through the golden leaves of the fir trees. Everyone enjoyed the moment. There was no more people around the king. He sat on a red carpet on the lawn. As the king was thinking about all the good things, he spotted Einon. The knight approached slowly, so that Einon could greet him first.

     The fishermen lived on the North shore of Lake Nipissing. On the weekends they came over to Ice fishing. When the water was very cold they would sleep on the ice and when it got warmer they would build huts and fish from the outside. They would go to the fishing ground once a week during the summer, the first day after the full moon. They would stay in the fishing hut for the whole night.
    
    During the winter they went to the ice hut every weekend, starting on the third day after the full moon. They slept on the ice that was in front of their huts. The fish would come swimming under the ice.
    
    ""Every day there would be a new catch!"" said John, the oldest one of the four fishermen.

'You can't be sure of that,' he said, 'unless you eat one of the small creatures you've been growing. They're harmless, but they do taste rather nice.' I was curious about what he meant so I said: 'I'm not eating them. They're very small, but I'm not about to waste my time hunting for food in the dark. I don't know if you are or not, but I'm going home now and don't intend to go anywhere else.' He seemed upset by this and said he was sorry we'd had to part that way.

     Police think burglars are most likely to hit houses during the afternoon, as families are out of the house at lunchtime.
    
    In January and February alone, 1,070 break-ins were recorded on the Eastbourne Borough Council area, a rise of 7% on the same period last year.
   
    Inspector Ian Saunders said: ""During the afternoon, most burglaries are to detached houses with the owners usually out and about with the children.
   
    ""During the day people tend to have their front doors and windows open and windows of nearby houses open as well.""
   
    Mr Saunders told the Argus that thieves were looking for 'easy pickings', and would target houses in areas where there was nothing of value inside.
   
    He added that it was a common misconception that burglars were looking for gold coins and watches inside a house. He said: ""They will be looking for wallets and purses, which can hold cash or cards with personal details that can be used to access houses and personal bank accounts.""

'Where are you going, Dad?' I asked. 'To a meeting'. 'What meeting?' I asked. 'Can I come?' 'No, you're too young', said Dad.
            Dad's absence was worrying. So was Mum's absence. When Mum wouldn't return, Dad called the police. An hour later, they discovered her corpse in the wood. Her car was on the road, so they assumed she had been driven there. The police had no proof of murder though, so they let Dad go home. The police also told Jude that he mustn't tell anyone about Lynette's death - even Mum. Jude and I sat in the house for a week and then Mum came home. I asked about Dad and Mum's meeting. Mum's answer was surprising. 'We were talking about the inheritance.' I asked who was talking to whom. Mum said no one, but she had been the one to push the idea, since she had no other ideas. She decided to leave Dad the house, even though she had never lived there. Dad had wanted to take Mum to the hospital in the car, but she refused to travel by car, for obvious reasons. "

     Every day Bill Prince-Smith writes. He puts the pen down at night, but in the office he scribbles away. In the morning he gives the work to his wife to read. If he'd read it himself he'd think it terrible—but his wife thinks the books are hilarious. It's the way he writes that makes them so funny. He writes by hand, using a pencil, then covers them over in blue ink. Sometimes his drawings appear in the book. But if it were illustrated by a professional it would all look too fancy—just too grown-up for the way his mind works. In the afternoon his wife reads the writing aloud. Then the manuscript is sent to the printer and becomes a paperback. By the time it hits the shelves, his audience has grown older and wiser, while his books have always remained the same age. So even when people are talking about things that were funny once, his books still are funny—they're always funny.
    Bill is sixty-three years old and he's still a farm boy. His father was a farmer, and he grew up on the farm just like his children do. Like his children, he was a teacher. He taught school for many years, and he also did some dentistry for a time. He went to dentist school after teaching, and now he's a dentist. Like his children, he had some failures and some successes, but the best part of his life has always been writing."

    This is a story about a man who likes line dancing so much that he decided to take up a club in his town. So one day, he bought some equipment and taught people how to dance line dances. But in fact, he's not the best dancer himself. The best line dancers are men in their 20s and 30s. This is because line dances are a man's hobby and they do it in the middle of the night. The man in the story is a teacher and he wanted to try line dancing himself, but he's no dancer himself. He did learn to teach people, and he started teaching them how to dance, but he was very clumsy. The people he taught were also very interested in line dancing. The man in the story has two young boys and his wife is pregnant with their second son. The wife likes to dance, and she took a dancing class recently. They are a happy family, and everyone in their town likes them.

He also said that he had no friends because none of them liked him, but his grandfather called him Small.
    Small was very smart and he always said that his grandfather was a brave man. One day, the Cerne Giant and his grandfather went to the town of Dorchester. There was a race to see who could go the fastest between Dorchester and the town of Cerne.
    When the race started, it was really hard for both the Cerne Giant and his grandfather to go fast because they were very short and small. Then the race started and the two of them got a good start. Then the Cerne Giant said ""my turn"" and he took off. But his grandfather was too slow because he wanted to be nice to his friend. The Cerne Giant won the race and his grandfather didn't. That was not fair.

     Wish sat in the corner of the study room and tried to sleep. He knew he had to talk to someone who was there. The sound of the rain on the window was quite relaxing. After a while, Wish decided that it was getting too late. He put on a pair of slippers and lay down on a chair.
He lay there a while until his feet started to move. The figure was about 2 feet from Wish's chair and moving in the same way. The shape was wearing black clothing that reached to the floor. It looked very strange. After a while, Wish realized the figure was standing closer. The rain started again, but now Wish was aware of the figure talking to him.
Wish was very curious. He started to listen with his ear against the window. ""I'm sorry, I have to go away soon,"" was all the ghost said. ""Who are you?” Wish asked the ghost.
""My name is Mr. Sanderson,"" the ghost replied. ""I came on Saturday to take some of our library books home, and I left on Sunday. I don't know you or your name, but I'd like to stay with you if you'd like to be my friend.""

    There are many crocodiles in the ocean. They are usually in one spot so you can see them from the beach. Crocodiles don't usually go onto the beach though and they can get very angry if you do. When you are on a beach, you need to be careful about your feet.
    
    When you look closely at the water's surface, you can see that crocodiles are very fast. If you get too close to the crocodiles, they can hurt you very badly if you are unlucky. You don't want to run or walk into the water as you might end up swimming with them.
    
    If you are in the water, it is important to stay away from any crocodiles that may be nearby. If you need to take a bath, you will need to go to a different part of the water. You can swim by yourself or with another person. The crocs are usually much bigger than you, so it will be easier for them to eat you.

They thought that the adventure would be nice, and they would go when their father was not at home. After two months of this, they went out, knowing that their father was at home waiting for them with his shotgun. They were very hungry and tired of going from house to house, looking for food. After about half an hour, they found a large cave where the food was hiding and decided to sleep the night in there. They did so without disturbing anyone, and the next day their father saw that the food had all disappeared. The three men saw the girl and told her that they would come after her. With great anger, she asked what happened to the food, to which her father answered that she must not know. She became quiet and left the cave. Two weeks later, their father came home. “Your dinner is ready,” he said. “What have you been up to?” “We looked everywhere for food, but we could find no food. All we found was the cave where we slept.” Her father knew she had been to the cave, but did not say anything. The next day, he went on another adventure, leaving her with her brother.

     Jack the Kid sat in the chair with a bad headache and a sore stomach. He sighed heavily, thinking about his plans for Christmas dinner. There were three families living in the small village of Christmastown. The Smith family owned the local grocery store, the Jones family was a merchant, the Blackman family owned the newspaper and had a lot of money and the Rader family lived in a mansion. Jack knew all of the families well and was looking forward to seeing them again at dinner. He'd been especially looking forward to seeing his friend, Ben, since he'd been so sick recently. Ben was one of the wealthiest people in the village but hadn't been feeling well for several weeks. ""Jack the Kid"" said his mother quietly. She always said he should try to be kind to everybody but he'd never understood what she meant. ""Be kind to everybody"" had been his mother's favorite saying for years but he wasn't sure what she meant. He wondered if his mother believed that he needed to be kind to all of the families he knew or if he just needed to be kind to everybody. ""Why did you say that?"" His mother asked after a moment. ""Because I think it's important to be kind to all of the families"" Jack said defensively. ""If we don't behave nicely to them, they'll think we're mean, unkind and nasty."" ""But, if we're nice, they'll think we're boring, shallow and conceited"""

     The history of the London police begins in 1727, when King George I of England appointed the first municipal police constable, Thomas Bawdsey, to watch over his citizens. It is said that he had a reputation of being a hard-working man, and a keen tax collector.
In 1780, the Royal Assent was given to the ""Act for the better regulation of the police in London"", a set of laws that allowed the London police constabulary to be organised into ranks (of up to eight) and set hours of duty. The London police's work expanded from protecting the city's citizens to guarding public buildings in the 1780s. The same time period also saw the development of the force's first training school, as well as the formation of special units, such as the Special Patrol Unit (1812), the first of London's riot police.
During the nineteenth century, London's population more than doubled. By the end of the century, the police's budget had doubled, from £5 million to £10 million per year. The police took a more aggressive attitude towards crime, with the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 giving the police power to arrest and imprison ""any person or persons committing or assisting in the committing of a crime, or otherwise obstructing justice, in any part of the said County"".
In 1838, a new Metropolitan Police Force was set up, and at the same time, the county police was disbanded. The police's duties also"

     Once upon a time there was a boy called Peter who went swimming in the lake with his brother James. He also had a fish who he called Andrew.

Then they had a dispute and Andrew tried to bite Peter but Peter said 'No' so Andrew said 'No bite' and they decided not to fight. The water became calm so they decided to do something else to make the water still: they climbed out of the water.

Then Peter hit Andrew on the head with a rock. He gave Andrew some fish to eat, and he gave the other fish to Peter. They took them to Mary and cooked them for breakfast. They couldn't eat them all, so they carried some for their dinner later.

The fish were very tasty but the smell of the frying fish made them faint. Mary told them to eat some bread, but before they could Peter said that they had forgotten something. Andrew suggested that they find some more fish and they thought about it for some time and concluded that they would go to the lake once a week to hunt for fish. Peter thought about going too but he didn't want to be left alone with Andrew.

The next morning they went to the lake, Peter cast his line and Andrew looked at the fish that were jumping in the water. He said to Peter 'It's time for your fish to bite'. Peter replied 'Ok', so Andrew did it and they all jumped.

But just before Peter put Andrew down he noticed"

     It seems like a good idea: run a boat in the Douro river between Porto and Barcelos to serve drinks and meals. The plan seems to work well until the Lord of the Manor decides to change the riverboat's name: the MV Lady Ivy May becomes the MV Lady Doreen. 

From there things go wrong: the new name is perceived as vulgar. So she has to change it again. Then she becomes too expensive so she has to be sold. The new owner has a daughter, who doesn't fit in with the new owners lifestyle, so she becomes the MV Lady Terence. 

The captain is really bored, so he starts a relationship with the stewardess. Meanwhile the boat has been given more expensive equipment to make it even more attractive. There is even a small pirate ship nearby to make things even better. One day the captain catches the princess in the boat. The princess refuses to answer his questions about her true parentage so the captain takes her to the castle. 

At that moment Terence, the stewardess and the pirate ship all appear again and the princess escapes. Later the boat is captured by Lord of the Manor who then wants to try out his own plans in the river. The boat is then locked in a small boat and Terence escapes on the pirate ship. The boat is then sailed to London.

The captain of the ship has now found a better place to start his business."

In the next room, Ardwyck Fenn was watching television and drinking alcohol. He saw Marina Gregg walk into the room from downstairs and run up the stairs.
    
    It was a murder. The detectives began to ask Ardwyck Fenn and Lola Brewster more questions.
    
    The detectives noticed that Ardwyck Fenn was drunk and told Lola Brewster to call an ambulance. Lola Brewster did so and when the ambulance arrived she took Ardwyck Fenn away.
   
    But Inspector Cornish had a theory that Lola Brewster had not run upstairs and called an ambulance. He noticed that it was getting dark, so that meant that it would soon be dark outside. It was also a very cold day, so that meant that it was likely that there was going to be some snow later that night. Cornish also noticed that Ardwyck Fenn was very suspicious. Finally, they realised that Fenn had gone downstairs to start a fire and that the fire had died down. The fireman came downstairs and confirmed that this was true.

     THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST

Hypatia was born in Alexandria in 370 A.D. For many centuries she was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books. Hypatia's father was director of Alexandria University and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual as most women then had few opportunities to study.

Hypatia was one of the few women of her time to attend classes in both philosophy and medicine. Her father allowed her to study these two disciplines at once so she could gain a more thorough understanding of medicine and philosophy. Hypatia was an extraordinary woman with much knowledge and insight.

She was interested in medicine as early as age five, when she was reading the works of Galen. When she was just 11 years old, she traveled to Athens where she studied medicine under Hippocrates. She returned to Alexandria and opened a clinic. This is where she spent the rest of her life.

Hypatia's death in 431 A.D. was an enormous loss to Egypt and Alexandria, but she did leave behind a collection of over 8,000 scrolls. Some of these writings are in Latin, which is spoken only by a small percentage of the world's population. The Latin language has preserved much of Hypatia's important message. 

Hypatia was also an accomplished orator. She gave more than 400 public speeches in her lifetime. She was a great teacher"

They are well prepared for feeding underwater because they can see very well and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food.

     The village of Jukkasjarvi is in Swedish Lapland and winter temperatures there can reach -40°C. But 6000 holidaymakers still go there annually to visit what is probably Europe's most unusual accommodation. In this hotel, you eat, drink and sleep in rooms made of ice. If you want, you can even get married in one.
    The Ice Hotel was built in 1995 and is open to tourists every winter. It has a bar, a restaurant, and five ice rooms, each measuring six by twelve metres and each consisting of three tonnes of ice set in concrete. A couple have a ceremony there, while others choose to celebrate their anniversary in the hotel's disco. But it is the hot tub that takes centre stage. The rooms are available as individual or group accommodation, and the prices start from 2,000 Swedish kronor (around £180).
    The owners of the hotel, Anders Sundström and his wife, Katarina, are also responsible for the hotel's famous ice bar, in the shape of a giant cube, and the bar's ice maze. The maze contains more than 1,300 different ice cubes. The maze is an experience in itself, but the bar is open until two in the morning. A typical cocktail costs around 20 kronor (around £1.40).
    Anders and Katarina started the hotel to give their three children a better experience of the holidays,"

     In the past, shoes were a necessary part of our everyday life. However, over the years shoes have been made for different purposes and the importance of shoes has changed over the years. The most common types of shoes used were animal skins, which were used to protect the feet and were tied over the feet of the person to be warm. These days however, shoes are used for different purposes such as protection, fashion, and comfort.

President James Buchanan visited the city of San Francisco as part of his trip across the Western United States in 1842, but it wasn't until 1850 that President William Henry Harrison actually set foot in the Golden State. Even then, his visit was cut short when he fell ill while visiting San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. 
    In 1888, the first transcontinental railroad was built through San Francisco. This opened up trade routes to the rest of the country and allowed the city to become one of the largest in the world. By the 20th century, San Francisco had become a megalopolis and the largest American city by land area. 
    Today, San Francisco continues to grow. The city has a variety of activities for all kinds of visitors, including its famous annual Fall Festival, a great place to get into the Halloween spirit. 
    Many people come to San Francisco to work for big companies. These companies produce products for the rest of the world. Other companies employ large numbers of people in the city and the rest of the state, providing employment"

""This is not very good! In my opinion, you are just copying another book.



Thanks for your answer. Actually, I'm not thinking of that. I think I would like to be in the group of International Book Club members that buy books through the post. I think this activity would be more interesting than reading the book at home. Also, I would like to find new friends. Therefore, I think, a book dub would be a good idea. As I understand, it is more interesting than doing other things like watching TV, etc. I have to admit that I would like to try it.I'd suggest something more original, perhaps even a travel book where you'd be reading the locations as you travel. There are many books out there with travel stories and the likes. Also, it'd be great to be around other people that are interested in these things. I'm sure you could create other fun activities with this. 
Edit: Also, I'm not sure you'll get enough members to have a book dub that's interesting enough to join. So keep that in mind.I think you should probably think what your real goal is. A book club is meant to be something that you're interested in doing with friends and people you're meeting. I don't think that you'd really be able to organize such a club, so your only choice"

They held a number of events in the park in an attempt to bring awareness of the situation of the sons and to gain support from others. The camp was also successful in attracting other people to support the campaign and it ran for six days. After the sixth day it began to attract a new audience and another six days was all it needed. During the whole campaign the camp held a number of events and the attendance at the various events grew gradually. The events held were small parties and gatherings where the mothers came to talk to the sons and some of the participants of the campaign. Some of the events included a play about love. The cast used two lights: one for each son. When the play ended and the audience asked questions about the play and the situation of the sons they were provided with information about the campaign. These questions were about a camp in progress. When the time came to go to bed the camp reached its peak in size and as such had to be disbanded.

B1,"Given this prompt: MONEY What is money? The pound the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book a huge bag of sweets or a couple of cinema tickets.

     Money is a unit of exchange; in the most simple of definitions it can be defined as something that can be given in exchange for something else. When the definition gets slightly more nuanced than this, one usually has in mind things such as notes and coins, but the point is that in essence, money is something given in exchange for something else.
To clarify the difference between what is commonly called money and notes and coins, a pound (symbol: £) is roughly worth the same as a dollar or a franc (symbol: €), but £ is much less valuable than a hundred €. (In other words, €100 is worth nearly a thousand pounds.) Similarly, a book is worth more than a hundred dollars, while a handful of sweets are worth a few cents. The relative values of these items are not affected by their relative value in pounds (although they may be affected by the relative value of their contents).
The value of money has varied throughout history, but it has almost universally been a feature of economic activity. Early attempts to define and standardize money were usually unsuccessful, as this has led to all sorts of different currencies, most of them based on their perceived usefulness and usefulness as medium of exchange. A prime example of a currency whose value was never standardized is the penny; it was used throughout the United Kingdom until 1796 and in the rest of the world until 1971. There are many variations on the penny in use in the UK, many of which have no"

     The day in the magazine was a success. I was called in for interviews on three different topics: the career of a zookeeper and my feelings on the topic of exotic pets, and a profile of a British family who was trying to conceive a child. All of these people had their own way of explaining their views on different things. First I had to talk about being a zookeeper for a living. Being a zoo keeper wasn't a job that most people would think about doing, so I had to explain that in a short, simple way. I had to then switch to talking about my feelings on exotic animals. My main reason for wanting to be a zookeeper was my love of animals. I wanted to be close to and be able to care for them in a natural way. There was no one particular animal that I would have wanted to work with, but I had a soft spot for tigers, and for wild animals in general. When I was younger I had a pet crocodile. I had also wanted to be a vet, so I had a lot of fun talking about that. The last thing I had to talk about was my profile piece. This was about a British family. They had recently had a baby, and the mother was wanting to have another child as soon as possible. At the moment she was working through a pregnancy, and it was not going well. I had to explain that in a very simple way, explaining that the mother had not wanted a"

There was a book in front of him, and he could think about the events of the last few days while he read. He felt more at home than he had felt for a long time. He liked it very much. A few minutes later, he left the room, and walked to the street. When he looked down on his feet he was glad they were in very good condition. He walked through the town, looking at its people and his environment. It was quite different from before. He found that it felt more alive. The streets were cleaner and there were more trees in the park. He also felt very happy. A few hours later, he went back to his room and fell to sleep. He dreamt that he was lying on a beautiful beach. He was looking at the blue sky, the blue water, the white clouds, and the white, fluffy sand. He was so happy.

B2,"Given this prompt: We are being bombarded with advertisements all the time and a lot of them are targeted at young people.

    Output the generated story directly.
     Advertising can target young children in ways that can have a profound impact on adults. In the TV adverts that we see, cartoon animals often do all the advertising and have their own separate TV programmes; the commercial advertising on the radio is often played to children, and the children’s television shows have children acting in them. If children can see and hear these adverts and programmes, and are able to understand them, the adverts can also influence their parents’ purchasing decisions.

These adverts are, therefore, targeted at children. For example, adverts for drinks can feature cartoon animals. In the TV adverts, it is the children who actually buy the drinks, not their parents. There is an interesting comparison with Jane Eyre, a novel that describes the influence of advertising and its effect on a young person, Charlotte Bronte. Her novel tells the story of a young, lonely governess, who becomes an active member of the society around her. Because the novel is about advertising, it also uses advertising as a source of information about the society. Bronte wanted her novel to be realistic, yet also give an insight into the society in which she lived, so that the reader felt as though he or she was experiencing society for the first time. The advertisements that she used in her book were carefully selected to tell a story that would not have been possible if she had used a different method of persuasion, such as using emotive words.

     As my father used to say:  ‘Gold in the gold rush!’ I was an eager student, desperate for the latest knowledge at a time of great change in my family's fortunes. I felt, as an only son in my mid-twenties, I should be doing something of significance to improve our lot in life. If I could find employment, I would not be too old to work with my father. On top of all that, I wanted to settle down and have a family. At that time, my father was an engineer on the railways, but no longer in the lucrative and well-paid role in which he had trained. For one thing, he was no longer in a seniority role, and another was his work was so demanding he could hardly spend time at home in his beloved Dublin city.
   
    His role at the railway was dangerous; there had been too many fatal accidents, so as he could not be blamed, and it was hard work to get the money to pay his medical expenses, he retired early at 62, with full pension, and moved to Limerick. I had my mother to support, and I was glad to have the company of my brother and sister, who also attended university. The idea of working at university was a novelty, and I quickly developed an interest in the subject I knew little about. It was not long before I had achieved a First in Modern History from the University of Dublin"

     First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, how we behave, and how quickly we speak. They also tend to judge us according to how we look, our voice, our pitch and our tone.
So if your name is Joe Smith, and you are sitting for an interview for a new job, you will probably find that most interviewers will think very highly of you if they see you in a nice suit, a tie, with nice shoes, your hair combed and brushed, your teeth shiny, and a well-shaven face. They will judge you by your appearance, rather than your character and your interview is likely to be very successful if you do not make a foolish mistake.
If your name is Dan Smith, and you are sitting for an interview for a new job, the opposite may be true: most interviewers will think very poorly of you if they see you in a t-shirt and jean shorts. They will judge you by your appearance, rather than your character and your interview will likely be very unsuccessful if you do not make a foolish mistake.

The ARPAnet was made of small computers.

The ARPAnet began to grow.

But now it was not the only network of computers.

Other networks began to appear.

After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful other networks began to appear.

The most common kind of network was called a local network.

The local network was made of smaller and smaller computers.

The local network began to grow.

But now it was not the only network of computers.

Other networks began to appear.

These networks were called wide-area networks (WANs).

WANs were made of computers connected by long lines.

The long lines carried data between different points within a WAN.

Some WANs were high-speed networks called optical networks.

Other WANs were high-speed networks called microwave networks.

In the early days of the Internet, the largest WAN was called the ARPANET.

ARPANET was made of computers connected by long lines.

ARPANET was the first network to show that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful.

     The ancient Romans were not the only ones who loved ice skating. In Scandinavia it was a social luxury. During the Middle Ages skating was a common sport among the wealthy. It seems to have developed at first as an indoor activity. Ice skates can be traced back to the Middle Ages in Scandinavia, from which we can see an evolution of both wooden and iron skates. The Roman tradition is evident in the archaeological record, with skates made from animal bones discovered. This seems to have been an important part of the social life in Scandinavia during the Middle Ages.
    
    The story starts with the ICE SKATING tradition that has had a long history, which can be seen in an archaeological record. Ice skating has been an indoor sport since the Middle Ages, when it was seen as part of the upper classes. The development of ice skating can be attributed to the introduction of iron in Scandinavia at the beginning of the twentieth century. It was then that skates made of animal bones were replaced with the iron ones. In the following years both types of skates continued to be used until the arrival of sneakers in the early 1970s.

     There once was a teenager called Alex. She loved swimming and loved cycling. She really loved running and swimming but not as much as cycling. So, she made up a triathlon because she really wanted to do an endurance sport. After she completed the challenge, she went for swimming. She told Alex, 'Swim the 1500m cycle 40km and then run 1Okm.'

She told Alex,'cycle the 1OOkm and then swim the 1500m.' Alex was puzzled. 'Cycle? What do you mean 'cycle'? And how can swimming be fun? And how can a schoolgirl do a triathlon?'
    
    Alex was a very sporty girl. She enjoyed swimming in the open sea because she loved the water. But she did not like running because she hated running on the beach. She preferred the path.

They went to dinner and afterwards went to a show. While at the show, Rachel accidentally spilled some of her drink onto the floor and there's a big stain there now. Rachel couldn't remember anything, including the name of the show they'd seen. Her husband was angry and asked her why she was making a mess. She said that she was thirsty and needed a drink, but later she realized she'd spilled her drink, too. Her husband was also angry because when she went to put the stain on the floor, she spilled the whole bottle of wine on the rug. He asked her why she drank so much. She said that her stomach was really upset and she needed a drink. And then they both went to bed, and the stain on the rug stayed there all night.

Despite the ups and downs, Emma likes her life, and tries to make the best of it. When she gets the chance, she likes to travel and enjoy the beauty of the area where she lives.

In the past, Emma had an easy life, but it ended in an accident. She became very ill because she didn't take the time to learn about medical issues.

     We're all getting too big for our boots!
     Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. ‘What do you want to be?’ asked the teacher. ‘The flagpole on a ship?’ The teacher had a point: because Chris, still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall.
    
    Chris was born with an abnormally large skull and brain. He suffered from cerebral palsy from birth, which affected his speech and coordination. However, Chris was determined to do well at school, and managed to achieve seven A* grades, nine A grades, two C grades and one D grade - although the last one was for an E at maths.
    
    Because of his size, Chris’s head grew rapidly, making it difficult to fit a helmet on his head. He suffered many head injuries at school. To protect himself, he always tried to sit in the front row or the furthest back row in the classroom. He also stood up during lessons, to avoid bumping into other people.
    
    His classmates, however, did not always accommodate Chris’s size and size-related challenges. They used cruel nicknames for Chris, such as ‘Tallie’ and ‘Stilt’. Chris found it very"

     Mike Rutherford took a GM concept on a road test and found that it wasn't as bad as expected.
    
    GM has a new way of doing things in its new EN-V concept, and it makes no bones about it being an experiment. The ""vehicle"" is more than a car, with a twin-cycle electric motor in each wheel and an electric-assist bike powertrain that produces 50hp and 250nm. It's a three-wheeler, meaning it has two wheels that steer independently and two wheels that steer in unison. The company claims a 0-62mph time of four seconds, but that only counts the first three seconds. The top speed is 75mph.

     The Earth would fall silent.  There would be no birds, no insects, no plants, no animals, nothing but silence.  And everything would slowly die.
    If humans disappeared from our planet, the world would quickly go silent.  The last humans would live on the outskirts of cities, in places where they could avoid the noise.  Most cities would quiet down, their inhabitants going on with their lives as if the rest of the world didn’t exist.  As people became more isolated, the streets became darker.  In the cities, the air would be dirty, the traffic noisy, and there would be nowhere to go to escape it.
    Birds would disappear from the air.  Their songs, the flapping of their wings, the soft sounds they make would be the sounds that the Earth would be left with.  In most places, they would have nowhere to go, and would starve to death or fall from the skies as buildings began to collapse.  Insects would become rare, and most of the earth would be empty of them.  But there would still be life on Earth.  Most of the creatures that still existed would adapt to survive, but a few would die out.  Plants would thrive in a new environment.  But after a couple of thousand years, the rest of the planet would be empty.  Life on Earth had not been gone for long enough to see all the animals and plants that would emerge"

     SUSIE was a very musical child. Her father played the piano when he was at home and her older brother was very good as well, so she learnt to play as well. She was the youngest of seven children and one of them, MARK, had been in a band when he was young. Now he had a baby girl with his wife, RUTH. They needed to find somewhere to practise the piano at home and when they did, it was her room. The problem was that, although she was an excellent pianist, there was nowhere else to sit and practise, and so she was a bit restricted by that fact. It didn't matter though as she still managed to practise as much as she could. It was a bit of a squeeze, though. She had a lot of books in her room, all of which were of interest to her. They were not very easy reading and one of her mother's friends had lent them to them before she died, so they would not return. That was not so much of a problem as they were all really old. It also got a bit messy as the books kept falling on the floor. One day, as she was practising, she got so involved in her music that she did not notice a letter that had come through the letter box. She opened it and read it carefully and she read the words again. The next morning, she could not remember what the letter said. Then she remembered. ""I'm so sorry."

     A NEW LIFE
The Farmer Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm. 'After 14 years in business, I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - nobody was having fun any more.
    After a trip to the Lake District, I knew I wanted to give my life some meaning, so I sold everything and moved to a farm in Wales. It's a great place to work, I get the birds singing in the morning, and I love helping out with the animals in the afternoons and evenings. The only problem is that the farmer's daughter is in love with me and she is about to make me very unhappy!
    This is not the first girl I have been in love with, and I suspect that it won't be the last. So, if I want to live a normal life, I need to get rid of her before I find myself in the same situation again.
    The last time we saw each other was on Christmas Eve, when I told her I didn't love her and broke up with her. And I still hope that I am right - she really is my soul mate, so I might just have to watch her move on if I do choose to break up with her.

     His life had not been much of a path. 
    The world began on a grey, cold morning at the dawn of a cold winter's day. 
   Tristan Smith lay curled up in a corner of his father's one room house. 
   His mother had died a long time ago, as Tristan lay awake, crying her name. 
   Then his father's voice came calling: ""Up you must get! You've slept through a great wedding party, and now we must go!"" 
   Tristan felt himself drifting off in a dream, as his father led him away. 
   He didn't know what it was like to wake up on another world. 
   But for the most part, life was like the dreams he'd had as a young child. 
   There was the sunrise, and the sunset. The birds of prey. And, sometimes, the smell of a new wood. 
   He had come from a life of kings and queens. But now, as he walked to the edge of the new world, he knew that his life would be a life of humble people in the wilderness. 
   This was his world: a world of wolves. 
   His father had died of cold. A coldness like the north wind of winter. The wolves ate his body, and their blood filled Tristan's lungs.

     Emma could not understand Charles’ resistance to her suggestion. At least he did not say it was too difficult to explain matters by letter. And now she was going to go and speak to Rouen himself, which would be easier than talking by letter. The letter would be delivered to Rouen’s wife, who would pass it on to Rouen. He could then tell Charles himself.
 Charles insisted he was not ill, and it was very kind of her to come, but that she was to be excused. She should return home and think over what to do next. She had been unable to come to any firm decision, because Charles was so adamantly against any other option than telling the truth. As the weeks passed, she felt increasingly frustrated, and it was only when she finally gave in and promised to write to Rouen himself that she had a little relief.
Emma, with Rouen’s letter in hand, had made the journey from her home at Rouen to England, to his castle at Longley. As she had arrived, she realized that she had not taken time to take a single look around the castle. She was anxious to make her request, and she would take the opportunity of a moment to pause and examine the surroundings, perhaps even to take a short walk. After all, that was what she had been called to do. She entered the great hall, as Rouen had instructed her to do in the letter. There"

     We listen to radio in the morning to remind us of the alarm clock. Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one?

Stuart reports that many of us have the radio for a few hours, then turn it off. But even so, we do not have much experience of listening to radio. Thus, most of the time we are still in a daze. The problem of the daze is that we still feel sleepy at the end of the radio programme. The radio programme has not yet helped us to awake, as we require an external stimulus to get us going. Thus, although our attention has been piqued for several hours, we still require a stimulus to wake us up.

I think we need something to remind us of this, to make us wake up early. This could be a radio programme, but a good way to accomplish this is to have the programme flash in our minds. So we can remember it later. The way to make this happen is to set a timer. So that whenever we wake up, our brains are flashed with the programme. It will trigger our consciousness to wake up. We can then take the programme from memory and use it to start the day.

     A small group of adventurous people leave few footprints.
Explore Worldwide, an adventure travel firm, arranges trips to a range of unusual places. The company has been founded to bring people closer to nature, and its trip to Mongolia is a perfect example of how it helps you do that.

Explore Worldwide set out to visit Mongolia as part of a large-scale adventure. To do that, however, the company needed to take a series of smaller trips, each focusing on a specific aspect of the trip. That meant a lot of individual attention, with everything from planning to the selection of food to the selection of souvenirs carefully scrutinised.
However, each trip also gave Explore Worldwide the opportunity to really get to know its travellers, by creating a unique experience that would be unforgettable. There’s a lot of detail to cover in a trip to Mongolia, including choosing the type of accommodation to suit the trip’s intended purpose, as well as choosing the meals and drinks that you’ll enjoy along the way.
In addition, the trip to Mongolia includes a whole range of optional extras that can really add to the experience, making it hard to say no to if you have a choice. These extras can cover things like seeing a cultural exhibition, having a chance to meet the locals in a rural community, or even trying to ride a bear.

     The most advertised brands of cigarettes are Philip Morris, Marlboro, Lucky Strike, and Winston.
In the past, the tobacco industry was worried that teenagers would give up smoking with the introduction of non-smokers, such as celebrities. They set out to understand the behavior of these non-smokers to try and dissuade them from starting.
In 1960, the tobacco industry tested the non-smokers to understand their behavior. The study found that in groups of non-smokers, the behavior of the smoker would be reversed. When the non-smokers made eye contact with the smoker, the smoker would often light up. They also found that the non-smokers would try to touch the smoker in places where smoking was not permitted, and that when the smokers smoked with each other, they would pass one another cigarettes to try to get the other to light up.
These results led the tobacco industry to believe that teenagers needed to be exposed to tobacco advertising in order to be convinced that they should smoke. They also realized that they should target teenagers with specific ads rather than random ones. Therefore, in the 1970s, they set out to create ads that would work for teenagers and create an impression that it was normal and cool to smoke. This led them to create ad campaigns like ""Dude, cigarettes are awesome"" and ""The only thing cooler than a pack of Marlboros is a pack of Marlboros.""

Ten miles south of the equator, a sony mountain track leads off the quiet 
metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya’s 
highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya.

Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain’s top 10000-metre runners, is in Kenya to try to win the Great Rift Valley 10K – a race he has won every year since 2004. But while training in the highlands, he is confronted with two very different experiences. 

In one camp, he meets a pair of men whose eyes give him the chill bumps. They have arrived at the camp disguised as women and are stealing from the camp. The men wear elaborate disguises and their only possessions are a small radio and a knife. They make a great spectacle of themselves, and Nerurkar becomes interested in them as a figure of fun and satire. 

Later, he finds out that the camp, which looks like a series of luxury apartments, is a high-tech training centre. The men are working on a new anti-aircraft system and Nerurkar is shown the latest technology. It is a new way of spotting aircraft from the air and is"

     There was once a young man called Tom Cunliffe. He'd just spent many years working in London, and finally he found a job at a shipyard. He was an honest man, so he worked hard in his workplace, and he wanted to have a great boat for his dream vacation. He went to work to his boss and said, ""Sir I need to start making a boat."" His boss, Mr. Jones, said, ""What do you mean?"" Tom said, ""Well, my dream boat is one that is designed to make a great journey, and it should combine both old-fashioned technologies and the new, because I want to combine the past with the future."" Mr. Jones said, ""Sounds good! But, I don't think you are qualified for that yet."" Tom asked, ""What do you mean? I can do everything."" His boss replied, ""That's right, you're a craftsman, not a designer. You can make a boat from wood, you can put together some metal here and there, you're a carpenter, not a architect. But a designer designs the whole ship from the ground up."" Tom said, ""Well, that's right."" Mr. Jones, being Mr. Jones, was always right. He gave Tom the order to make the new boat, and the young man with ambition and enthusiasm started to work on it.

     We visited the tartan museum in Edinburgh recently and found it to be a bit of a bore. But, we suppose, it wasn't set up for you. But we bet that the contents of the museum would have been quite interesting to you. This prompt was inspired by a recent visit to that museum and the fact that we now find it impossible to forget the tartan hats of the people here. We've thought of several ways to turn this prompt into a story you can actually read.

You can tell this prompt to be the opening sequence to a film set in Scotland, or perhaps to an audio play. But, of course, we don't want to make it that complex. What we want to do is make the story more accessible by keeping it concise. That's why, here, we've decided to tell this story in the form of a podcast, which is easier to understand.

Here's what we've done so far. First, we need to decide on the character of our narrator. He will be telling a story about the contents of the tartan museum, and we're going to have a human narrator. That means our protagonist will speak in a rather regular style. He or she will not be a real person but an invented character, a fictional narrator. You may call this narrator the narrator of this story.

As for the story's context, it will take place inside a fictional institution in a fictional place in Scotland, the Museum of Tart"

He's doing it by retracing the path of the 1665 astronomer.  But after his failed first visit, Dr Clark must face one of the great mysteries of modern science: is the true north variable?
He travels from London to Cheshire to work on the Halley comet and meets a fellow researcher who's on his own quest for a 'true north'.  But first, they must cross a river.  The researcher, with the help of a friend, goes across, and when they get to the other side, they discover there's another river, running parallel to the first.

     After years of studying the maps, I finally made up my mind: I will climb the Seven Summits, from the North Pole to the South Pole. I will start my quest at the North Pole, climb Mt. Everest in Tibet, and I will then move to Everest Base Camp. 
As I will have to start in the coldest part of the year, I will set the first milestone from the North Pole: I will take the Seven-Up Mountaineer Doug Scott ‘s advice and try the world’s tallest mountain: Mount Everest.
At the end of my quest, I will have managed to reach the highest point on each continent, as well as the North and South Pole.
I will start my quest when the North Pole is coldest, but, thanks to a thick layer of ice, my first stop will be the South Pole. That way, the weather and the climate of Antarctica will be my second stop. I will then make my way to the North Pole and continue my climb. I will finish on the summit of the South Pole, but I will have to move quickly. The ice layer that protects the top of the South Pole is receding every day, so if I miss it I will have to try the next highest peak, Mt. Everest, which is situated in China. If I get there, I will have to cross the Himalayas, where the weather is often harsh and dangerous. On the summit of Mt."

     A Greek-Roman Museum.
The University Museum of Classical Archaeology.
The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of cast works of ancient sculpture. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas, cast from the originals mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
    The Museum exhibits only the ancient sculptures from its collections. For the most part, these are from Greece and the Roman empire. The Museum also has some objects from the cultures around the Mediterranean and some ancient pottery. Most objects were brought to the Greek island of Crete by the Greeks during the Roman empire. These objects include some statues of Zeus, Zeus' mother Athena, and Hera.
    The first thing visitors should know when they enter the Museum is that these objects are not to be viewed or handled. The collections are extremely valuable. All the sculptures are of great artistic importance and are irreplaceable works of art. The Museum does not want them damaged in any way. This also includes the cast sculptures.
    After you have entered the Museum and seen all the objects, you will be directed to the special room that contains the cast sculptures. The room is dim and well-lit so you can appreciate all the works of art better. All these sculptures are on display in their original state. The only exception to that is the Zeus sculpture, which is not completely finished"

     Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories. He saw them on video. He wanted to see for himself what they were saying and what he thought about it. There was a lot of it. There was a lot of science, there was also a lot of talking and there was a lot of fun. Then, as if on cue, the plane made a sudden dive and Tom looked down and saw the plane's wings jutting up and down, and he noticed something strange. He looked at one student and saw she looked straight ahead, not even looking around. She seemed to be holding herself up with gravity. Another student was looking off into space as if he had already been there. Tom told the students that for this day's experiment they would be flying upside down. As they all knew, weightlessness is different from gravity. Tom told them they were flying around the planet, but upside down, because the Earth had spinned. But then they noticed something very interesting. On a different planet where they had flown, gravity was still the same. And then it dawned on them. They had not been upside down at all. Instead, they had been flying upside down on an entirely new planet which rotated on a completely different axis, just like our planet. The students felt sad for a while. It seemed that their experiment had been an enormous success and they felt they had not been able to properly test their theories. They were disappointed, but they did"

Richard Cork recalls how as an 78-year-old student he came face-to-face with one of the most revered artists of the century. Even seen at a distance eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes, Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an eight-year-old student filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van.
   
    I was at an exhibition in Monaco and was invited by someone to join them at the restaurant at the end of the exhibition. There I saw for the first time, up close, one of the most respected artists of the century. When I'd taken some photos of him, he pointed to the one I'd done and said: ""Don't be a fool, it's not me."" I had to keep a poker face.
   
    He was extremely charming. The conversation took place, in effect, in front of all of his friends and I was in the background, looking very sad.

C1,"Given this prompt: Hit and miss of mass marketing AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.

     There is something deeply depressing about looking at television ads and seeing the people in them almost constantly frowning or grimacing, with an air of defeat and regret on their faces. But is it? Are advertising people actually frowning or grimacing? Are people actually feeling regret, defeat or even apathy because of advertising, or do they just think they do?
    
    We're told that advertisements have always been part of our culture. They've been there for millennia, ever since the caveman days, when we'd eat fire-roasted buffalo meat while watching animals fight to the death on animal horns and eat fruit that'd fallen from the tree or fallen from a bird's beak. We're told that when people see advertisements they are automatically influenced to buy something or do something. But is this always true? Do advertisements always lead to buying something or doing something?
    
    We might say that advertisement in the old days was very different from the way advertising is done today. We've all seen old advertisements for car washes and deodorants. These advertisements were meant to appeal to our primal desire to get things clean and smelling good. These old ads made us feel good and proud of our skin and our deodorant. We couldn't wait to get out and go running in the warm sun and then wash our hair with a little cologne and eat a chocolate bar after our run. Now advertisements make us feel"

     We're very similar to chimps.
If anything, we're probably closer to gorillas.
That's why we do a lot of the things gorillas do.
But they've had a lot of time to develop their different features.
Like speech.
But I think that a lot of things that we do that we did over a long time—
                   —we didn't start out doing them.
       But it's quite hard to do things that we didn't start out doing
       when you're not really born with them.
    We still don't really know how we developed language.
      It may have been like the other apes, or maybe it started later.
      I think our speech developed the same way.
      We started out not really knowing how to talk properly.
     We only really learned how to talk properly.
      It took a very long time for us to learn how to talk like that.
      I think that with our hands we started out really slowly.
      I think our hands were always sort of like that.
      We weren't really designed for doing things using our hands.

     Beginner Takes All Even before it was published The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph.
    
    In the first months of the year, not being a good film director, nor indeed writer, was not kind to Nicholas Evans. As if by accident, he was making his first foray into fiction, starting with a novel, Beginner Takes All Even, which he had chosen because he liked it. He is in the London studio of his literary agent, David Allen Green, the director of the successful Harry Potter films, and it is early December. It is not going well.
    
    He is frustrated, distracted, and trying to distract himself with the film, about to start filming, which has cast him as a horse whisperer, but the novel, he thinks, is a very different kind of job. At least in the film he could pretend to be a character and not really have to live the life of a writer. It would be better to become a film director than a novelist, but it was not going to work this time either. He was not really going to enjoy this very difficult job that the novel had turned into. And so he was thinking seriously about what he had got himself into.

    The opening scenes offer a fascinating examination of the nature of freedom and power. The great leader Marlowe, the most important character in the play, has been driven to madness. His chief rival, the scheming Willy Loman, takes advantage of his state to seize control over him. It is a play that, even now, is a great political document, and Marlowe was well aware of the parallels between his own world and the world he was writing about.

The judge seemed annoyed by the interruption, so he quickly explained what happened and said that he wanted a job, which the judge agreed to.

It was a Tuesday and after work, Isabel headed to the local cafe. There she ordered a coffee and tried to make small talk with the other customers. But that was difficult, because people were glued to their phones. So she ordered a cup of tea instead. It was just in time before a man entered the cafe.

     ""Is your office working ok?"" was the question asked to me by an anxious executive of a local company as she came into my office to interview me for the role of her new Human Resources Manager. The question was, of course, quite innocent but what she really wanted to know was whether I would be happy to do the job that she offered me.
   
  
  
  
  
 My answer was, yes, in fact I would. However, that is not quite the same thing as saying that I am 'working ok'.
  
  
  
  
  
  
 So how do we go about working our way to the right 'no' to an offer that we might not really want? Well, that is quite simple: by asking a lot of questions and getting a lot of information in order to make an informed decision. But first, let me try to describe this situation as best I can for readers of lower levels of the English language.
  
  
  
  
  
 I am going to give you a fictional example of what I think is a typical interview question. The question was, somewhat quizzically, ‘What is your greatest weakness?’ I replied that my greatest weakness was not being able to work out what to do in a given situation – that I simply couldn’t work out which is the right action"

     My story begins with me sitting in the sun after my holiday in Greece. I'm watching the birds and listening to my music. I didn't sleep at all after I returned from Greece. I was too busy thinking what I could do to escape from the horrible life I have, and I had a really good idea. So, I took off the bandages and wrapped my left foot in a lot of bandages. It hurt really bad, but at last, the pain went. I looked at myself in the mirror and I could not believe it. I was so happy. I felt so proud of my new plan, and I was looking forward to getting it done. I packed my bag, because I was going to start my journey to get away from my life. I told my mum that I was coming home. She took me out for a last time. I felt that she was saying goodbye to me for the last time and for that, I couldn't cope. That day in the hospital, I said to my family that I will never come back and that I will never leave again. They were shocked and upset. They said that they will always miss me. I said that it's not true. I just want to live a normal life, like everyone else does. They asked what was wrong and I told them that I don't want to be a normal person like them, but someone different. They looked at each other and they understood me, but they said that they would"

C2,"Given this prompt: Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need.

     The amateurs took it up: Amateur Astronomy.
The first telescope to be owned by amateurs was built by Charles Bell in 1855. Since that time, they have continued to take up this hobby. Astronomy has seen some changes during these times. Firstly, telescopes were still very expensive when the hobby was first started, and people had to take lots of courses to learn how to use them. Secondly, some of the equipment was hard to use and not easy to understand. Now, however, there is a range of different equipment which is cheap to buy and easy to use.
Another big change in astronomy during the past few decades is that telescopes have become smaller. In the 1950's, a telescope the size of a large room would have been required to observe objects with. These are now built so the diameter of the telescope is the size of a room. This allows us to see much more distant objects.
But the biggest change in astronomy during the last few decades has been in our knowledge of astronomy. Up until the 1950's, we knew little about astronomy. Most of the research was on objects nearer the Earth. This did, however, open up a whole world of interesting objects in the universe. Since that time, we have learnt a lot about the night sky and how to observe it. People who study astronomy have a vast array of books and charts to help them. They can find out about objects from planets to galaxies in books written by professional astronomers. The latest"

     Metals - Stone Age people liked metals because they were useful for jewellery, tools, decorations, etc. 
 Stone Age people didn't have to use metals because they had stone that was easier to work with. 
 They didn't use metals because they weren't necessary. 
  They wanted to impress other people or because they were useful. 
 Stone Age people used stone to make tools.
  If they wanted to impress other people they would have used gold or silver. 
 They would also have used stones that were hard, but not too hard. 
  There would have been more of a variety of stones in stone tools, such as chert, flint, beryl, and so on. 
  Because it would be easy to carve into the stones, they would be able to get tools that were sharper and more useful than the steel or gold used by modern-day humans.
  The tools were also better suited to digging for food. 
  Stone tools were still useful because they had better grip and were able to fit the human body shape. 
  They also could be made to fit the body of a larger animal. 
  If there was anything left over from the food that was dug out with the tools, they could be used as decoration. 
  Some people did use the tools for jewellery and they had to use the metals for their jewelry.

     The Wrong Country

Uncle chose for them a package holiday at a very reasonable price: a flight from Gatwick Airport twelve nights in Venice the fairyland city in the Pensione Concordia.
When Keith and Dawne went together to the travel agency to make the booking the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast all of them learning Italian.

Keith and Dawne decided that this would be a good opportunity to practice their English. They had two things to say: ""No, thank you"" and ""How much do you think we could get for selling our tickets to them instead?""

The counter clerk, being Italian, was not at all offended by this request. However, he quickly informed Keith and Dawne that he wasn't the one who made the booking and couldn't change it now. He was sorry to disappoint them. But he also suggested that they could sell the tickets to the school group and get some extra cash for themselves.

Keith and Dawne didn't agree with this solution either. They explained that they had booked the package and didn't want to give up on it just yet. The counter clerk reluctantly agreed to look into it. As soon as he returned, he quickly assured Keith and Dawne that they would be able to sell their tickets. He also said that they could ask for the full value back from the school group as an apology.

C2,"Given this prompt: Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal.

     The sun was setting, and the lions were coming out for their supper. The hunters were a group of black cats, who liked to eat meat. They knew the best place to hunt was in the forest, where the other animals would not see them coming. But first, the animals needed to find out where the food was hidden. So the leader of the cats would tell them with a call, so that the cats could all see what he was pointing out. The group would walk in a circle, until they found something. 
Then the leader of the cats would announce which one of the group should make a dash for the food. This was so they could divide up the food without the animals knowing it. 
But first, the cats needed to be clever about their hunting. As it was getting dark, they would not be able to see anything very well. So they would listen for the call, and see how close the hunters were by the number of cubs that were running around with the older cats. Then the leader of the cats would decide whether they should all dash for the food together, or go separately. When they were alone, the cats would each take an animal, and hunt it down. 
But first, they needed to be clever about the way they divided up the food. Each cat was to get an animal that looked exactly like it, so that the others would know what they were eating. If they all ate the same animal, they would all"

Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse, I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. I felt dizzy and nauseous as I stood at the barrier, taking in the sights, which were not that great anyway. It was Easter Monday but all I could see was the sun shining down on a field full of grey, wet goats. It was freezing, I couldn’t feel my hands or feet. And the only thing that was running through my mind was my grandfather. How long had it been since he’d seen his family? I was aching to hug him but couldn’t move to help him out. I thought that there was a competition that was supposed to take place at 4pm. Everyone who could see my grandfather would want to know what was happening and be worried, but I knew that was not the case. I knew there would be nothing wrong with him unless the competition did actually start and someone had to stop it, so I was the only one who could take him in my arms and hold him for a bit.

     Lancelot laughed a hearty chuckle to himself as the secretary announced that he didn't take sugar.  He loved his daily cup of coffee.  He had a special place in his mind to which he referred when he thought about what would happen tomorrow.  It was a comforting thought that made him smile, even though he still hadn't figured out how he was going to pay for all of the fine wine, jewels and food that he'd bought that day.
He knew exactly what to do about the coffee.  First, he thanked her profusely for all of the wonderful coffee.  Then he asked her to please make more, this time with a dash of salt.  He couldn't have enough salt in his coffee.  Salt and sugar went so well together.
Once the cup of coffee was finished, Lancelot asked her to make another just like it but this time with vanilla.  He loved vanilla.  A little vanilla could make almost any coffee taste better.
The secretary laughed as she poured the second cup.  ""The only problem is that I don't even know what you told me to make your coffee with,"" she joked.  She knew that Lancelot's favorite beverage wasn't milk or cream.  It was coffee flavored with vanilla.
But before she could continue, Lancelot reached across the desk and took her cup, filled it with the coffee he'd already made, handed it back to her, and walked away.

     It was a long, cold, bleak winter and the rain was just pouring down when Ian McMillan and James Marr met for the first time in the dark. “He seemed very nervous,” remembers the British engineer. But despite the dark surroundings, the two men soon started to chat about bamboo bicycles, and it quickly became apparent that they had a lot in common.
That first meeting was in the city of Nottingham, in the United Kingdom, on the other side of the world from McMillan’s home in Scotland, but it was only a matter of time before the two men found themselves at the same bamboo bike workshop. The workshop, which provides courses and courses in bamboo bike building and repair, is a few miles away from the city of Nottingham and is where McMillan and Marr started their professional collaboration.
The duo soon met and decided that bamboo bikes would be the way to go. “I think bamboo is the future in many ways,” explains Marr. “Firstly, it’s recyclable. Secondly, it’s pretty light – about 3.5 pounds per pound. Thirdly, there’s nothing wrong with the way it works, it’s just not popular.”
“So you think they will one day become popular,” asked McMillan.

     A new exhibition charts the history of kinetic art — that is, art which is concerned with movement — in the 20th century.
    Kinetic Art Rejoice — the well-nigh impossible has happened: London’s austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not by some huge-budget mega-hyped multi-media extravaganza but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years.
    An exhibition of over 60 works charting the history of kinetic art has opened at London’s Hayward Gallery. It runs until 5 January 2018, in a venue formerly occupied by the late art collector Sir Peter Blake.
    The exhibition explores an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years — kinetic art — that concerns movement.
    Founded in 1969, it involved artists who tried to create work that moved on its own or in response to external forces, such as light and wind.
    The history of the form can be traced back to the mid-1930s, with the first kinetic art exhibitions — mainly in New York — in the mid-1950s.
    A seminal moment was the 1967 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. The collection included some of the most celebrated examples of kinetic art in the world, including the paintings and sculptures of Donald Judd.

     The world is full of people like me. Some make me laugh. Others make me cry. But at the end of the day, no one ever hurts me like the ones I meet in the streets of London, for the simple reason that, in my world, there is no one who really loves me. 
  
 They tell me my past was a disaster. But I know it isn't true. Because I know that they are all liars. And what I know, in my heart, is that they only want me, and that's why they're lying to me. It doesn't mean I can't trust them or feel sorry for them, but only for a moment, until I know that they won't ever really love me.
  
 I'm like a child at a party who won't eat the cake, because the parents took it away in the last ten minutes. My whole life has been a horrible tragedy that will end with my death and my funeral. It's just that, in this terrible time, I have a few friends who I can depend on.
  
 But they don't understand how I feel, they only see me as a sad, sad person who needs their help. And so they help me. And I know it feels good, when you feel you need help, but there is always a limit to what we can do.

     Given this prompt: The Lure of the Kitchen

 When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It was on the face of it an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously hard lives. The work is long pressured, menial – and badly paid.
    
    It was not difficult to convince others of my choice. I was tall and handsome, well mannered and well spoken. I had a fine education and a brilliant mind. I had a natural talent for the culinary arts and a flair for promotion. My skills and personality soon made me extremely popular.
    
    And it was a difficult thing to resist. The glamour of the kitchen became a lure. I soon found my way to kitchens at some of the most exclusive restaurants and hotels. I enjoyed the work and the glamour. I relished the challenges and the risks involved. But I knew it was a dangerous occupation. And I had no intention of risking my life for the sake of a few thousand pounds a year.
    
    And then one day I made a terrible mistake.

    I was in a kitchen at a very famous hotel in London. I was cooking a particularly successful lunch for a very important client. I had been preparing the meal all day. I"

And I could smell the strong rancid scent of the horse and cow manure. I went to the bar to ask the cowboy for water, and then to drink water.

     As you are writing a text for C1, you might have some of the questions that C2 might ask. For example, if you write for C1 you might be asked to translate into C2 some words like ""bravo"" or ""stupende"", which might be harder in your native language. In this case you might write a short text about this translation.


As you work on your book you might also consider writing a translation for other languages. For example, if you write a book in English and you're using an online translation tool, then you can translate some words in your English text into Russian or another language.


It could also be useful to translate a text in other languages, like French, into your own language, in order to make it more readable.

As you make progress in your translation, you might find that you can generate some interesting stories. For example, it might be interesting to translate a passage from one language into another one.

For example, if you translate the passage in Russian for your book about English, and you write a story about how the Englishman, Tom, met a Russian woman, Anna, in a hotel in Moscow, you might make up a story with this English-Russian story as the main conflict.

You could also use your translation in a text that you write for your book, for example, a report for a teacher. If your reader reads the translation in her own language,"

     The heat is on!
    The earth's temperature is rising rapidly because of global warming and we know it is going to increase further. However, just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives? Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about but no one is quite sure about its consequences.
    A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. As a result, we will see more extreme weather events. As the temperature increases, the moisture in the air increases too so it will lead to more rainfall and flooding. As the world heats up, the oceans will absorb more and more heat and we will see an increased threat of melting glaciers. We will also have more heatwaves.
    Our bodies react to heat differently and this could have some dangerous consequences. Even though our bodies will adapt, those who are overweight or vulnerable such as the elderly or young will be affected by an increase in the number and intensity of heat waves. More heatwaves will put more strain on our health care systems. In addition, there will be an increase in air pollution as more people burn coal, oil or gas to keep warm. We could also see an increase in diseases like diabetes, asthma and heart disease.

That’s what John says about England in the story. “It’s not far from the Midlands and Wales.”

Map of England from Google Maps

Now, imagine you are given a map. It’s a map of the whole of the United States. On the map, you can see all of the cities, towns, counties, states, and congressional districts. You can also see all of the countries and territories (excepting China).

For the purpose of the story, assume that the map is an actual map. We know that the map shows John’s point of view. So this is the map that John would see on his journey.

“I’m in the south.”

The south of the map is located between the 49th parallel north and the equator. That’s around the United States and central Europe.

“I can see Russia.”

The map starts south of the United States and ends in the west coast of Africa. Russia is on the eastern coast of Africa (south of the equator).

“That’s the West Coast.”

After the west coast of Africa, the map is a bit smaller and ends just around the Mediterranean Sea, also in Africa.

     The great polar explorer Ernest Shackleton had a number of faults as a manager: being an inflexible perfectionist, often demanding that decisions be made in his own way. He also had difficulty working with other people, particularly subordinates. But perhaps his greatest fault was that he wasn't much of a people person. In fact, he was a people person in the British sense of the word -- an avid observer of the personalities of those around him. What he was not was a people person in the American sense of the term -- a person who gets excited when others are excited.

C2,"Given this prompt: Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain. In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques.

     Susan Hallam thinks this technological revolution in music has changed the way we listen to it, with new forms of 'digital' music and video now displacing traditional forms on the market. While the arrival of home music players and MP3 players has led to a huge drop in the number of people buying vinyl discs or paying for CD subscriptions (which are now being replaced by on-line streaming services), Hallam's main point is that there has been a change in the way we listen to music. And, she claims, it is because of the rapid development in computing systems that we are able to listen in such new ways. For example, by using the internet to make on-line music selections, it is possible now to skip all of the'middle bits' of listening and concentrate on the music being played out, which reduces the amount of time we spend listening.
    
    Hallam gives some examples of this technological change, starting with the arrival of radio, which allowed listeners to tune into any of several hundred stations and skip through the'middle bits' of listening. Then there was the arrival of the television and, later, the video recorder and, finally, the video player, with the video playing in a 'window' or behind the scenes - with no real sound. The arrival of these new technologies in music listening led to a drop in the number of people listening to vinyl records and CD subscriptions.

     Robert took some photographs in his backyard in the summer. He decided to develop the photos using a particular darkroom method.
He had never developed any photographs before and the method that he was going to use was a new experiment in black-and-white photography. He had never done it before and he knew that it would be very expensive for him, because he had never developed any photographs.
After taking the photos, he tried them in the darkroom method and he was really impressed. But then, when he developed them with a new technique, it turned out that his photos were much better.
But he hadn't used the correct technique. He used another one.  He should have used the correct one.  But then he also changed it.  He thought that, because he had used the first technique the photos had not turned out as well, and it was the second technique that made them so good.
He was always thinking like this, and this distracted him from the original approach, and he didn't notice the difference in the photos' quality until after he developed them twice.
The photographs' quality was not so good, but still, he thought they were quite good. But, when they were developed in two different techniques, the difference in the quality became evident. 
Robert felt ashamed of this. He realized his mistake and tried to correct it, but he wasn't able to do so. He was so embarrassed that he wanted to tell his friends,"

     Broadcasting originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of  optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, the production of the conditions to produce a rich harvest.
    A man is digging a hole in the ground. Two more men arrive from two other sides. They each dig two holes in the ground, where they put some seeds. All three of them stand in front of the first one, who is now planting the seeds. He then closes the three holes with a large iron shovel.
    When this first man has finished his task, four more men arrive, two on the left side, two on the right. They each put two seeds in their own two holes. Once again the four men stand in front of the first one, who is now planting the seeds. They close the three holes again with the shovel.
    The three original men, who came to start the whole project, now leave. A total of nine men come. Four on the left, four on the right. Each of them put two seeds into two holes. They form a total of 12 men. Each of these groups of twelve men now go back. They each put two seeds into their own two holes. When they have all done this, 16 men are there.

     Writing reviews is hard. Not everything can be done perfectly. What makes it all worth it is when you get a great review. This book is about writing great reviews by practicing what is known as the “rule of three”, which is the main principle of writing reviews. I will discuss various techniques you can use to ensure that your reviews are read, commented on, and appreciated.
I don't feel that reviews should be too long or too complex. People will rarely read these long reviews. They'll rather stop and go straight to the comments section to get more details. Keep it simple. I like it when a review has only one paragraph of information. For example, if I want to buy a new car, I would look up some reviews from the manufacturers or sites I am interested in. It would be so much easier to just read the first paragraph or two to get the overall feeling for that particular brand or model.

Write the summary, not the review.
Your summary should summarize what the reader needs to know. It's a summary, not a review.
The best way to avoid having too long a summary is to divide it into sections. In this way, you can put your best thoughts about the subject in the first and foremost section, and put the less informative part of the summary in the second one. This way, the reader will get the best of the summary, but will not be bothered by the less important parts.
