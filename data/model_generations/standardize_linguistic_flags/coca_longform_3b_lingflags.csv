Sherlock Holmes is one of the most famous detectives in the world and he solves mysteries all over the world. Now his friend Dr. Watson comes to London to look for him, but when they got there they were so shocked that they almost died! The two men have met many strange and unusual places and creatures all around the world, and they don't know what are their real names or their real faces. In the end, Sherlock Holmes shows to Dr. Watson how to save the people who had almost died. They got a lot of adventures and interesting mysteries in their lives.      Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created this character by making a story that he wrote for the London Daily News. He didn't know that the character would develop into one of the most famous detectives ever, which is why there are so many famous movies based on his work. Many of his stories are a bit simple for a book about mystery, but that's because this genre tends to contain a lot of clich√©s. He was a very famous author at the time when he was writing this type of books, so there's no doubt that most of his stories will be familiar to modern audiences.       I am a little confused because I've read that the characters are not in fact real. The stories I've heard are that the stories are all fictitious stories based around real people who live in the past"

Because we always hid when they were not looking, so they started to punish us for being too naughty. We have never got anything for our hard work. They said we should not get it, because it will help to prevent us from getting in trouble. However, I have to admit, I have gotten a little jealous about it. I wonder why they do not reward us for what we do and not the other way around. I can not wait for the time when I would be able to get what I worked so hard for. I wish they will think more about me and my brother and reward us for what we did for them and not the other way around. I hope that they will consider the fact that we have never got anything, not even just one sentence or word. I just want a simple sentence that says something like: ‚ÄúWork hard for your reward.‚Äù. I am ready to work hard for it.My family and I work too hard to get a reward for our effort. It seems unfair to me. My parents say they work hard so that they do not have to work again.

When I was a small boy, my dad would always tell me, ""Son, treasure is when you come across something wonderful, something amazing, but it is not expected."" I still remember his words and, even today, I treasure them. What he was saying is that treasure is not something that you look forward to, but that you seek out when you have an urge to go outside and find something. Treasure is also what you find when you do seek it out. The best treasure is not something material and physical; the best treasure is something that is spiritual and that has great meaning. The best treasure is the one that grows out of your faith and that brings you closer to God. Just as a father will hide a treasure in a place you would not expect, so will the Lord, the God of the universe. So, my father says that treasure is when something amazing comes out of God. God has a treasure to give you when you walk in faith and trust. He has an amazing thing to give you that you never knew you were looking for. You may not even realize at first what treasure you have been given, but, just like that son who always waited until his dad said the word, so you must be like the father, waiting for your father to say the word and to give you something wonderful. You should treasure your father's words like I treasure my father's words.     In this lesson, you are going to learn about treasure, about"

Suddenly, he stumbled on the path towards the treasure. But soon, the path became so busy with other people that he had to detour into a lane. When he was about to travel on the lane, a dark figure suddenly blocked his path. ""It's not possible, you can't go past me!"" he shouted. At that moment, the figure disappeared from the light. Caleb felt very suspicious of that dark figure. He decided to go on ahead. When he arrived at the path, he read the note on the treasure map. The map had two directions marked. The first direction was to a certain treasure. The second direction was to a place that had a light at the end of the road. Caleb decided to travel to the place marked by the light. He walked through the road and saw a house with a big garden at the end. ""What a great day!"" he said.

The myths of the Greek gods had been a source of amusement for the people during their youth. When they grew old and tired of these myths they could read something more interesting like Homer's Iliad, or Sophocles' Phaedra or Aeschylus' Oresteia. But in those times there were people that had been born in that era, or even that year, who had not read any book. In that way the myths were a constant source of amusement. After all, they are not as interesting as the real events, but they always managed to be amusing. They were a constant source of interest to the human beings in the Greek and Roman empires, who always made sure that their subjects were aware of those myths. Even so, those myths lost popularity, for they weren‚Äôt as exciting as the real events in history. The only time the myths were popular was when the authors decided to give them a new spin. When people were bored of hearing about these events, the writers came up with a new spin in the form of a story, a play or a poem. That way the myths could continue to be entertaining. The writer was not writing about the events themselves but rather about the events surrounding them, so they needed to come up with some kind of plot, for without a plot there would be no meaning. After all, people would have no idea what story was to be told. The fact is that even the real events were not without"

The boy and the girl seem to connect for a moment. The girl is now worried and so is the boy, who then runs. The girl goes after him and he disappears again. The girl is now worried even more and so are the mother and the woman who live by the lake. The girl finds the man and she, the mother, and the woman go into the lake. She tells the man that she loves him and that she never thought she could love another man. The man does not say anything, but starts crying and disappears in the water. The girl stands at the side, looking confused, and finally starts to cry too. When the mother and the woman return they all go to the man who tells them that he is a ghost and that this is his life.

Two Brothers Tale 1     The first brother was very poor and his brother was rich. Their parents told them not to quarrel because this is bad luck. But the first brother argued with his brother. He said to him, ""I am a carpenter, and I know a lot. I don't need to be taught by the second brother"". The second brother felt insulted because he was inferior in knowledge and he also had not learned that lesson yet. When they were alone, they still argued. Then the first brother went out into the forest to work. He chopped wood and he also built a house. Later, his parents and the other villagers asked him, ""Why did you spend so much time in the forest?"" But he said to them, ""I had no choice. I didn't know how to build the house without wood"". The second brother felt guilty for his brother being imprisoned and he promised that he will go to the forest and he will bring him some wood. But the second brother never went there to bring the wood and the first brother was unhappy. He called his parents and he said to them, ""My brother has gone into the forest to gather wood and he hasn't come back. I'm really sorry about that"". The parents were upset too and they called his brother. They said to him, ""Your brother has already gone into the forest to gather wood and he hasn't come back"".

Titanic is one of the most tragic and widely read voyages in literature. The S.S. Titanic disaster, which occurred on April 15, 1912, is the second worst maritime disaster in history, after the Titanic disaster. The story is based on the 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic, which took the lives of more than 1,500 people, including more than 800 Americans. In the story, twelve wealthy families sail on the Titanic along with more than 12,000 people. The Titanic, the second-largest ocean liner in the world at the time, was making a voyage from England to New York City when it capsized in the Atlantic Ocean due to a shipwreck. The sinking was caused by poor safety practices on the part of the ship‚Äôs crew and its owners. The S.S. Titanic sank in the same area that the RMS Titanic had capsized, and both ships became submerged and sank together. Titanic is one of the best-known and tragic ships in literature.  The S.S. Titanic was the second-largest ocean liner at the time of the sinking, but had already had several serious mechanical difficulties with its boilers. The ship was loaded with too much coal and had the wrong number of crew members on board, which resulted in the ship sinking from a collision with an iceberg near Newfoundland, Canada. The ship was unable to change its course, because it was not equipped with radar"

It was the latter who had decided to go to America, and had left the ship at the port of Liverpool. He traveled by land until he got to the town of Cork, and then he sailed on, until he got to America. The captain was greatly relieved, as he had not seen his son for so long.

The challenges to be faced were, for most of the students,  challenges that many adults face in their daily lives.  Many of the students felt that  their generation was facing a  ""crisis"" in terms of finances, the environment, jobs and the many  changes that have taken place in these areas,  which has led to  increasing  stresses and anxiety for many of them. One of the students  described how the challenges in the world were, for most of them, not  physical or military but mental and emotional. He felt that many of the  stresses and anxieties they faced were caused  by social media where they often found the people they knew  to be, for whatever reason, no longer able to be honest and open  with each other, and he had many  conversations with his teachers about the impact  social media was having on  young people.

For instance, the text ""What was the Fox thinking?"" may contain too many words, such as the sentence, ""How very silly I am! My bad, I am. (I'm really, really, sorry.)"" Because the Fox is silly, and therefore stupid, and I am the wise one, then this story can be considered a fable. When a fable is short, it tends to use fewer words to convey the same message, for instance, ""What was the Fox thinking?"" uses about 100 words to tell a short story, as opposed to the sentence, ""I was thinking. And thinking. And thinking,"" which is approximately 10,000 words. Because the story is shorter and simpler, it can be easier to understand. However, a fable that is long, complex, or both often relies on multiple meanings, such as, ""What was the Fox thinking?"" is really about the Fox being silly, and therefore stupid, which is what this story is about, but this story also provides meaning for other situations that are sillier than the Fox being silly. Another way that a fable is made hard to understand is by its use of repetition. A story that uses repetition over and over again is often difficult to understand, and it becomes even more confusing when the story uses multiple repetitions. For example, ""Fox is silly"" makes it difficult to understand which part of the sentence is repeated again and again. ""How very silly I am"

Sorcery - The art or science of using magic  Rafaele D'Amico had been given a powerful magic by his father that allowed him to speak with spirits. Unfortunately, that same power enabled him to see things that no other human can see. And now he had to decide which side he would choose.          Rafaele and his friend were standing outside of the castle as the sun began to set. Rafaele had found a quiet spot to watch the sky. As he looked up, his eyes grew heavy with the darkness. The sky was covered by a black cloud.          Rafaele was not just looking at the cloud. He was seeing the destruction that was coming. It was like the very fabric of reality was being ripped asunder.          The sun vanished, leaving behind a dark night. As the night descended on Rafaele's kingdom, a great explosion shattered the land. The world was covered with a fiery lava. The air was filled with an odour so strong it drove Rafaele and his friends to run.          They ran until they stopped. And then they realized what they had seen. All over the land, fire was spreading from mountain to mountain. And no one was there to put it out.          As Rafae"

The enchantments are an enchantment: they entice the user to go beyond that which he or she was designed to see. They allow a person to go through walls, climb over cliffs, and go into places other beings know not of, or even feel.  They create and cause other enchantments, which are like walls, or blocks of land that block the way of other creatures. The Enchantments, like their names, are all over the world. Some areas have many enchantments, while others do not, which means they can be seen in all climates and in all lands. The most common type of enchantment is the Wall. A person may see or find a Wall of land, that can stop a person's movement, but, the person does not go through the Wall and is not harmed.  Some areas, such as the ocean, have other types of Walls. For instance, water may have a Wall of water in it, which can stop a person's movement and force them to turn back around. Other Walls have enchantments. They may be a person or animals, or things such as trees.  People can be affected by an Enchantment of other things. If a person is on top of a Wall of land and someone were to jump off, the person would be able to see or hear the sound of the person's fall. However, this sounds would not go toward the person, but from the person to the other person. Similarly, if a person were"

The town of Farrow was a small and prosperous place and it was known for its many forts. Many castles were built here over the years. Farrow Castle and the surrounding forts were used as a defensive line and it was known to be very difficult to break. In fact, the town was not destroyed by any war or battle but rather by an enormous earthquake that occurred several times in recent history.         The earthquake was so large that it completely devastated the town and the forts of Farrow. Many people were killed and many more were forced to live in the ruins and fend for themselves. Luckily, the forts had been built on top of the rock that had held the ground at bay, so the walls of the forts themselves were not damaged. It is said that the earthquake only lasted for a short amount of time but everyone was terrified.         When the earthquake occurred, everyone was in the castle and no one knew about the earthquake until it was over. Everyone in the castle was safe and that was the first sign of hope. Then, people who were nearby heard the roar of the winds that came with the earthquake and then felt the ground shaking. It was just like the great quake that struck Farrow some years earlier and everyone was very terrified.         That was when people in the forts first heard about it.

The pilot was looking for a good spot to land the plane, and suddenly he saw the North Pole, because he saw an old snowglobe. When he saw the North Pole, he stopped to ask Mrs. Zabel if it was true that the North Pole was the coldest place on earth. Mrs. Zabel replied yes because it was like a furnace there, so the pilot decided to land it there. Mrs. Zabel had a sudden feeling of horror, so she tried to warn her students but no one listened, so she had to run from the plane. On landing, it started to snow, and because of the snow the plane started to spin, so the pilot landed it again, this time without warning.

This is the second lesson in my teacher training course on Common Core Standards.  This week, I‚Äôve been working on one of my favorite parts of teaching, the assessment part.  My learners are not quite ready to read, so I will give them simple tasks to do with simple texts in order to see how fast they learn and to gauge their progress.  When they are ready, I will move on to more complex texts and see how well they do at reading. For today, we‚Äôre reading a story with a lot of references.  It‚Äôs a lot of references and so I know it will be difficult for my learners to read.  I‚Äôm using two different methods to assess their reading ability.  The more standard method is to use the ‚ÄúReading Comprehension‚Äù rubric for grades 6-8.  The learners would then rate their comprehension of the text as good, intermediate, or poor, using a scale of 1 to 9, where 1 is the worst and 9 is the best.  The second method I‚Äôm using is the ‚ÄúRead-Aloud‚Äù rubric.  This rubric only uses 3 criteria to judge reading ability, namely:  1) read with comprehension; 2) speak clearly and actively; and 3) listen actively and attentively.  The learners would then rate their reading ability by writing down their answers in the provided box.  This method is not standardized"

One day the king of the land called for the chiefs of the people to go out and talk to the people about their concerns. The chiefs agreed and went out into the lands and began talking to the people. After doing this for a few days they returned to the King and told him about what they had talked to the people about. The king decided he would not continue to make the same mistakes over and over again so he ordered all of the chiefs to come to his palace to figure out what the problem was.

Dad: Well, we can fish on the beach or the river, but the river is a bit more convenient because it's a bit more fresh.     Me: Let's do the river.     I love this day.     The river was so full of fish. There was a fish market only a few meters from the shore. I want to buy some fish to eat. I'll be back soon.     I'm going to buy some fresh fish, and I'll have some lunch.     Dad was so happy. He always looked really excited when he would talk about fishing. I want to keep on fishing. I love it.     We took a boat to the shore to start our fishing trip. Then, I saw a fisherman going to the market. I wondered why he was so excited. I hope he is going to buy some fish to eat.  "

The Mystery In a single class period, I showed them a mystery book and asked them, ""what is it?"" Example: The detective in the mystery book asks a million questions and solves a million mysteries. After reading it, students should be able to give some context and reasoning to identify the mystery. The mystery should be an event that is of the level ""someone has put the fruit there, then the thing did it, then there was a fuss about it.""      The Mystery One of my students wrote a mystery story which is a story about a monster which eats the fruit. The monster was made of a lot of metal, and it came from the sun, and then it was the sun's monster, and then it ate the fruit.The Mystery I showed them a picture of the monster, and told them I had a question for them to solve.

But at the end of the dark path, it will lead to something... something that'll give me a treasure that I don't deserve. Like a necklace of gold that will be engraved with the words I deserve. But there will be someone who'll steal this treasure and put it on his/her neck instead, and I won't be able to see it anymore... I'll be forced to keep walking.

Myths is a myth-drama that starts in the present and ends in the future.

The present one was about how they are part of the present. The future was about their life after the war. I personally liked this play. It's not a long play but it had a lot of elements that I liked, like the flashback and flash-forward scenes. I did not like the play because it went too much on the future and did not enough on the present. Other than that, I thought it was a really good play. The only thing I wished is that it had some more detail when it comes to the conflict in the play. Other than that, I think it's a great play. Myths, although it was a play that I would not recommend to any young person, was a really good play and I like the way it told the story.

You can imagine lonely monsters out in the forests hiding behind trees. Or lonely monsters sitting on the edge of your bed and trying to sleep. But when it gets dark, they turn and walk away. And that is because the monsters are tired. When it's light, they are happy to come out and meet the morning. But when night falls, they turn back to hiding from the light. They hide to be safe, as well as to be warm. It's very sad to think of all the loneliness they go through. They never really know what's on the other side of their closed and dark eyes. And they will never see what happens in the next hour, or the next day, or the next week, or the next lifetime. Maybe they are waiting until we have the chance to see them face to face. But I don't know how we could see them, because there's no way to tell if they are friendly or dangerous. And the thing that makes them the saddest, is that they just don't know.

In this version, a wizard Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe) is sent to England from his home of Scotland by a muggle who knows the Potter family. The wizard Potter's school is Hogwarts. Harry Potter is given the task of learning spells. The spell that Harry Potter is given his first class is a spell that turns things invisible, which is called a hex. This is what the wizard uses to spy on the muggle world. A professor of the school is also a wizard, and he teaches the students spell casting. As a student, Harry learns to turn himself invisible, so that he can spy in the muggle world. This is a challenging spell because the muggle does not know what a hex is or what it can do. The witch/wizard, on the other hand, knows. The spell is made even more challenging by the fact that the muggle knows Harry Potter is in their world.

A kingdom is a place where several entities share similar or similar traits. The king is the most prominent of these and has his own rules. A kingdom is always divided into the same four sectors.  In the beginning of a kingdom, the king rules all areas with the help of his advisors. The king sets the right and rules for the people to live their lives. After many years, the kingdom has developed into a large empire. All the decisions made by the king's advisor will be followed by the people of the kingdom. In order to achieve that the people are divided into three kinds of people. The first kind are the nobles, who are chosen for their knowledge of military matters. The second kind are the commoners who are given the privilege to work in the fields and can have a simple life. The third kind of people are the slaves, who do the hard work in the fields. When all the people are divided and living in harmony, the kingdom is a great nation. On the other hand, when a nation has no regulations, it has a weak and unstable government. The kingdom in this case is no different. The kingdom is a strong and stable country, but the king is not there to rule. Therefore, the king's advisors have too much power. The commoners do not have rights at all. All citizens are given no rights at all, and they are always forced to work hard without any pay. This causes the people to be unhappy with the government. "

I think that because it's written by a young person, it shows the strength of young people today. In our society today, young people aren't just trying to survive, but trying to thrive and grow! In this story, the writer has brought her ideas about life and death to a much younger audience. The story also gives a lesson in accepting change and learning how to deal with it. The author writes about the feeling of a young girl feeling unsafe when her uncle is sent away because he is gay and how she deals with the fact that he is gay. By giving an example of her uncle's life that was not perfect but was still very loving and accepting, the author is trying to teach her reader how to accept other people, who are different than themselves, just as they are. The story also teaches us a bit about death. I think that"

""The Jolly Roger"" A pirate stood on the dock of his beloved city with an important piece of cargo. But this was no ordinary cargo. This cargo was precious jewels, a treasure that would be worth much more than the ransom any pirate would offer. As such, it was vital that he not be caught. This was his plan, and he made sure that no one would ever know. But fate had other ideas. An anonymous tip led to the pirate‚Äôs arrest. The jewel he was carrying was destroyed by the authorities, and the money that was hidden with it was confiscated. The remaining jewels would be split between the four people who had helped find and arrest the pirate. The reward would be given to the pirate‚Äôs wife, who had been his right-hand man for as long as he had been a pirate. The captain was angry with the government for ruining his plans, and was sentenced to death by firing squad. Two years later, the captain was sitting in prison with nothing to do. Suddenly, he received a letter from the government. The letter explained that the bounty, in cash, had been put up for the two remaining pirates. If they could deliver the captain to the government, they would receive their reward. If the captain could not deliver the captain, his wife would receive the reward instead. In this way, the pirates would each be provided for, and all the ransom money would be accounted for. The captain knew which"

When a child sees an old stump in the wood, it wishes that it could talk to the stump, but after the child goes back to bed, the stump's voice becomes insistent. The child's family sends him to a healer. The healer explains that the child's problems are due to his inability to let go of his desire to speak to the stump, and the child is advised to go back to sleep. The next night, the stump is still begging him to speak with it. The girl tells her family that the only way to make the stump silent is to kill him. They are afraid that the boy will grow up to be a bad boy who will never be good, so they find a sword that can kill children. As the child is growing up, he finds a magical compass, and he carries it with him everywhere he goes. A witch comes by the forest, and her cat does not follow her. She wants the cat to follow her so that she can catch him. The cat, however, is afraid of the witch's cat, so the witch has to trick the cat into following her. The witch and her cat then use the arrow in the compass to lure the cat into a tree, but the cat jumps down before the witch can kill it.

The Great Human Era  It was a long and prosperous era, but also a long and miserable era, and it all began with the first man. And the first man discovered the power that could change the world: fire.  Fire had been discovered in every corner of the world. Humans began to use fire to cook and dry their food, to light their homes, and to create warmth. But it was a dangerous and deadly fire. Humans had never before been able to make fire that didn't burn them. The wood they used for fire was made of sticks covered with dry leaves and branches, and the leaves and branches could not be tamed or tamed. With the taming of fire, humans suddenly had a new ability, and they used the new ability to create a world that was safe and comfortable.  	But as fire brought many changes to the world, it also brought many dangers, and humans began to understand that they needed to limit the use of fire so that humans would stay safe.
