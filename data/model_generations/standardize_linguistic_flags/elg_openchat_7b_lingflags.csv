A2,"Given this story: Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings like museums to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. A The people who build the building use these pictures as guides. They are very careful with all the parts of the building - the brickwork, the woodwork, the floors and so on. They use many different tools and machines to help them do their jobs. When the building is finished, people can use it. They are very proud of the building and look after it. This is how it has always been. So, buildings are a very important part of the way we live. They are very interesting to look at. Some of them are also very beautiful. They are built from all sorts of different materials and in many different ways.  Now, let us take a look at some of them. The first two are very important for our lives. 1 Houses We live in them with our families. They can be small, with just one or two rooms, or very big, with many rooms. They can have walls of wood or bricks and a roof of wood or tiles. Some have gardens around them with trees, flowers and grass. This makes the houses very pretty. In the past, many people lived in big houses with lots of rooms and even more people living in them. Now, many people want to live in small houses and like to have gardens around them. In the future, we will probably have even more different kinds of houses. We will live in new materials, or we will build houses in strange shapes.

People build things like houses and stadiums. People build things so they can do fun stuff, like staying warm, and watching football. 

There are many ways to build things. One way is to have someone draw a plan for the building. That person is called an architect. The people who help build the building, use that plan like a map. They use tools and machines, they are really careful when they work, so the building looks nice.

We need buildings because they make life easier. They also make things look nice. People use all different materials to build, and build in different ways.

The most important buildings we have are homes and schools. Homes are for families to live in. Some have gardens. Schools are for kids to learn.

In the past, people built big houses. Now, they like smaller houses with gardens. In the future, we'll have even more types of houses.

We will use new materials and shapes to build homes and schools. It will be interesting to see what new things people build in the future! We will always need buildings to make life better.

So, buildings are important, interesting and beautiful. And they are a part of our lives. We always need buildings to make our lives easier and prettier. 

People like to make nice things so they can use them."

From head to tail they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot! Tigers usually hunt at night and eat animals like deer, wild boar and antelope. They can be found in many parts of Asia. The snow leopard is a smaller kind of big cat that lives in the mountains of Asia. It has a thick fur which keeps it warm in the cold climate. Snow leopards mainly eat sheep and other small animals. They live in high mountains in parts of China, Nepal and Pakistan. There are not many snow leopards left as they are hunted and their land is being used for farming. The jaguar is a big cat which can be found in parts of South America and Central America. It can grow to be 2.5m long! They are good swimmers and can sometimes be found near rivers or lakes. Jaguars mainly eat capybara, which are large, pig-like animals that live in South America, and caiman, which are a type of crocodile. The cougar or mountain lion is another kind of big cat found in the Americas. They can be found in parts of South America, North America and Central America. They are also known as pumas.

'It cannot be the mysterious illness from the village' I thought. 'My illness is now three weeks old. A:. It must be something else.' 'If you think you're not in pain', Dr. Peterson asked 'what ails you?' Well, I had a terrible headache for days. I couldn't stand to have anything to do with my family. I had a strange feeling of fear that seemed to fill my whole body, especially when I woke up in the morning. I was also losing weight. I couldn't eat, and when I tried to go to sleep, it was as though I were in a desert. 'So you have a lot of worries?' the doctor asked. 'No', I answered. 'I'm worried about nothing. I'm just too healthy. I suppose my problem is that I can't accept that sickness can happen to me'. 'If you are that healthy,' Dr. Peterson finally said, 'perhaps you should try doing something worthwhile, such as getting yourself married?' I left the doctor's office that day feeling both annoyed and humiliated. At the end of the week, however, I realized that the doctor was right. I decided to go out with a woman who lived in my apartment building. We enjoyed each other's company from the start. We were married the following year, and for the next four years we were very happy together. But then her health began to fail, and she was bedridden and depressed for several years before she died.

A2,"Given this story: The history of horse racing From the first history books ever written it is clear that horse racing has always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. A The origins of horse racing can be traced to ancient civilizations such as Greece, chariot racing was very popular during the time of Alexander the Great, and the Persian Empire had a special kind of horse racing called ""Noblesse Oblige."" In ancient Rome, horse racing was an essential part of the gladiator games. The horses were bred for speed and strength, and the races were often brutal and bloody affairs. However, it was in the Middle Ages when horse racing really began to take off. In 1125 AD, the first recorded race took place in England, and by the 13th century, horse racing had spread throughout Europe. The first organized races in England were run under the auspices of King Richard III in 1314. These early races were known as ""turf courses"" and took place on a variety of terrains. During the Tudor period, horse racing became very popular among the aristocracy. The most famous race of this period was the Derby Stakes, which was first run in 1776 and is still run to this day. The sport continued to grow in popularity during the 18th and 19th centuries, with races being held all over the country. In 1775, the Jockey Club was founded, and it quickly became the governing.

'I've got a lion for the king in the box' said the driver. 'Is it large?' asked Don Quixote. 'It's the biggest lion in this country' said the driver. Don Quixote felt a great joy in his heart and his eyes glowed. 'Ah! How good of you to bring a lion!' he exclaimed. 'May God keep you safe and bring you back safe' he added. Then he thought about what he had heard. A man had a lion in that great box? No, it couldn't be! He realized that he was tired and that he wasn't seeing clearly. 'It's not a lion', thought he, 'It must be a calf inside that big box.' When he understood this, he couldn't help but feel a little sad. 'Oh, if it's a calf, then everything I've thought is wrong and I'm not the knight I thought I was! No, that can't be', he thought, 'I must see more clearly.' But the horses were already very near, and he knew he couldn't think anymore. He left the driver to drive on. As Don Quixote had left him, the driver kept telling the other people that there was a knight who carried a lion in the same way he would carry a calf. The people laughed at the driver and at the idea of the knight carrying a calf in such a way. Don Quixote knew nothing of all this and felt a little sad. He didn't know whether to be happy or to cry. So he decided that the only thing.

Don Quixote was happy. He thought he saw the lion inside the box. But he soon realized he was too tired to see clearly. He thought maybe he saw a calf in the box instead.

Don Quixote felt a bit sad. He didn't know if he was still a knight. The horses were near, and Don Quixote couldn't think more. The man told others that a knight carried a lion like a calf. The people laughed, and Don Quixote didn't know what to do. He was happy and sad at the same time. So he decided to do something. He didn't know what to do, but he would figure it out.

A2,"Given this story: Kong went back to Ann and took her down from the high rock. For the first time in this jungle she felt strangely safe. He jumped across a ravine and then across a river. She was a small plaything between his large fingers. Then he stopped and put her down. Saksham Mahajan: ""When the cat's away, the mice will play."" The End. (It was a dream) (This story is based on a picture story, which has been provided by Saksham Mahajan.) In Ann's dream, she is in the jungle and has been captured by Kong, an enormous gorilla. Ann is afraid at first, but as Kong takes her through the jungle, she realizes that he is protecting her. Eventually, she wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. The story can be interpreted as a reflection of Ann's fear of the unknown and her gradual realization that sometimes what appears to be scary can be safe and comforting. The dream also serves as a metaphor for facing one's fears and finding comfort in unexpected places. The story can also be seen as an exploration of the theme of ""stranger danger,"" where Ann is cautious of Kong at first, but then learns to trust him. This theme can be applied to real-life situations where people are wary of strangers, but eventually learn to trust them. The story also highlights the theme of overcoming one's fears. Ann is initially scared of Kong, but as they journey together, she realizes that he is not a threat and is actually protecting her. This can be seen as a representation of how people can overcome.

On the road between them there are a lot of green hills and fields. On one of these hills is a picture of a very large man. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to him is called Cerne. The giant's head is in the sky, and he has a club in one hand. Nobody knows what the giant is doing with the club, because it is just part of the big picture drawn on the hill.

From the road below it is hard to imagine how big the giant is, but when you see him from above, you get an idea of the size and the detail of his picture on the hill. You can see then that his face is as big as the inside of a house. The giant looks very much like a Roman soldier, but nobody knows for sure what he really represents. It is very hard to guess why someone would have drawn the picture on the hill many years ago, because nobody knows who drew it or why. But there are many different ideas about the giant. Some people say it was drawn by an artist who liked to draw big pictures, or that it was made by a Roman soldier who was a giant of a man, or maybe it was a Druid who had the giant magic powers to make the giant out of the grass and the hill.

All rhinos have big heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The great body of the rhino stands on four short legs. A rhino has a horn on the top of its head. The horn is made of a special bone called the keratin. Keratin is what bird’s beaks and human fingernails are made of. Food: Rhinos eat a lot of plants. Most like to eat leaves, grass and plants, and they can also eat small branches, twigs and small bushes. Rhinos don’t like eating fruit or flowers. They have a very small stomach and can’t digest food very well. That means they need to eat a lot every day. Habitat: In Africa, there are two kinds of rhinos: the White Rhino and the Black Rhino. The White Rhino lives in the plains and grasslands of Africa. The Black Rhino likes forest areas more, but is also found in some open areas. In Asia, there are three kinds of rhinos.

That explained why the ghost didn't leave Clayton's house, but it didn't explain why the ghost had chosen Clayton's room. Why him and not someone else? Clayton said, 'I think because I am always alone. My life has always been lonely. Maybe the ghost chose me because he can see that I need a friend. I am sad, lonely, and I am always here. It feels so empty at times.' Sanderson said, 'Maybe it has something to do with energy. You and the ghost both have low energy. Maybe it just comes to you because it can feel your energy. It must feel lonely, too.' Wish said, 'That must be awful. Poor Clayton. It doesn't sound nice to have a ghost as a friend. Maybe you should try to do something about it?' Clayton said, 'I don.

One day in 1982, Barack Obama, who was in America, got a call from a stranger in Kenya. It was his aunt, Jane, and she said, ""I am your aunt, Jane, and your father has passed away."" 

His father, Barack Obama Sr., had died in Kenya when he was 46 years old. He had a car accident, and the car went off the road and hit a tree. 

When Obama Sr. was a young man, he didn't like the US, where he was born, and preferred living in Kenya. He worked there as a government official and liked African writer, Tom Wolfe. 

Obama's mother wanted him to live with her, but his father chose to stay in Kenya, and took him with his cousin. After a while, his father had an accident and broke his arm. Even then, he didn't want to go back to America. 

After the accident, his mother went to live with her brother, Onyango, who was also a government official. He was from the Luo tribe, like Obama Sr. After that, Obama and his mother lived with Onyango and his family. 

Although Obama's father was gone, Obama continued to live in Kenya until he was two years old. After that, he went to live with his maternal grandparents in Hawaii. "

A2,"Given this story: THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today there are policemen everywhere but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor.  In 1728, the City of London created the first ""watchmen."" They were called ""Night watchmen."" There were two night watchmen for each City Ward.  In 1737, the first two night watchmen died, and new men took their place. They were called ""Churchwardens"" and ""Constables."" They were also called ""Chips."" ""Chips"" wore uniforms for the first time.  In 1751, the City of London created the first full time paid officers of police. They were called ""Masters in Sessions"" but people called them ""Bow Street Runners"" after the street where they worked.  In 1829, the Metropolitan Police Act was passed by parliament. With the help of London's mayor, Sir Robert Peel started the police force that still exists today. Sir Robert Peel believed that the police must serve and protect the people.  He also believed that the police should have to obey the law, too. The new police wore blue uniforms and they became known as ""Peelers."" They still protect and serve the people of London today. THE METROPOLITAN POLICE FORCE The Metropolitan Police Service, more commonly known as the London Metropolitan Police or simply the Met, is the territorial police force responsible for law.

Nobody can answer my questions', she thought as she looked at the door. 'Nobody but him'. The door was slightly open. She turned the handle and walked in. Inside was a man who seemed to be very nervous. He was sitting at the desk and looking at some papers in front of him. 'Come in. Come in', he said. 'Why have you come?' I need to ask you questions'. 'I'm sorry, you are not free to ask your questions', said the man. Mary tried to talk about other things, but the man would not listen. 'You can't stop me asking, even if you want to. You have to answer, because I'm your mother'. As Mary said these words, the man stood up in shock. 'My mother!' he said. 'But I'm 35 years old, and you don't look old enough to be my mother'. Mary laughed. 'It's late, you'd better go back to your room'. She went out of the room quietly, and the man never forgot that night. From then on, he was always kind to her.

It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. My sister Emma said the place was packed with people. It was almost all adults, but some kids were there too. I was really excited. Emma sat down and I couldn't wait. I looked around, trying to spot the elephants. The big, grey, huge creatures came in pairs. After a while, I noticed a very fat lady who was trying to talk to an elephant. But the elephant just kept on walking. Emma and I started to laugh a lot. A few minutes later, an old man came up to the fat lady and asked her to get down. It looked as if he was going to punish the elephant. The elephant then began to move his trunk back and forth as if he was dancing. The old man started to dance with the elephant. They were having a great time! A lady who was sitting behind us was giggling. I knew I had to keep quiet or the old man would notice me and Emma. I tried to breathe slowly. Then a boy, who looked a bit like me, got up in front of us. I thought he was going to fall because his legs were shaking. Then he sat down again. I couldn't help laughing. This time, the old man looked in my direction but didn't see me. Finally, the show was over. Emma and I decided to leave. The sun was shining and the park was beautiful. We had so.

It had 6 rooms and was built from ice brought from the river Torne. Since then the icehotel has grown each year to become one of the most recognized landmarks of the region. The original ICEHOTEL at Jukkasjärvi is the original and largest hotel made of ice and snow in the world. Each winter, around 10,000 tons of ice from the nearby Torne river is collected, and used to build the hotel. The hotel is completely rebuilt every year, and lasts throughout the winter before the ice melts and returns to the river. Today, ICEHOTEL has 65 rooms and 3 suites. It also has a church, art gallery, bar, restaurant and sauna. The temperature is usually kept at -5 degrees Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit), which keeps the ice solid but comfortable for guests. A warm sleeping bag is recommended. There are more ICEHOTELs in other parts of the world, but the original and biggest is the ICEHOTEL in Jukkasjärvi, Sweden.

Each year, lots of people climb the mountain called Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is so high, so there can be very cold weather. Keith Hewitt talks about his first big winter climb on this mountain. He went with Mike, his brother Alan, and a guide named Tom.

They began climbing on a day with sun and mist. They wore warm clothes, and the air was thin. Mike felt tired, so he stopped while the others continued. Tom talked about his time as a guide and scary stories about winter on mountains.

Finally, they reached the top of the mountain. It was a long, skinny ridge, very high above the ground. They felt proud and happy because they were standing on the highest mountain in Britain. It took them about eight hours to get there.

They all climbed down safely after that, but our story today is just about the climb to the top. This story should be easier to read than the original because it is much shorter and simpler.

B1,"Given this story: Being an older student At 32 I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary although I was earning a reasonable amount of money I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. JAYA BHANOT 14 years ago, I made a decision that would change my life forever. I felt that a corporate job, while financially rewarding, was not intellectually challenging enough for my liking. Fourteen years after obtaining my Master of Arts in English Literature from Osmania University, I took the decision of doing it all over again, this time at Delhi's esteemed Jawaharlal Nehru University. However, I wasn't just going to be a passive student, I wanted to be actively involved in academic life - taking part in seminars and presenting papers. To my regret, my experience at JNU so far has been a bitter disappointment. I find that many faculty members here are completely indifferent to the needs of students. They seem to possess little, or no, passion for what they teach. Their monotonous lectures in a dead language leave me totally disinterested. This is, of course, not to say that I am expecting my teachers to always be entertaining, but even a tiny spark of enthusiasm could ignite our interest. I have noticed that quite a few of these professors prefer to sit and dictate from their notes instead of encouraging students to ask questions and discuss topics. I find this kind of teaching method to be outmoded and uninspiring. There seems to be a severe lack of communication between students and teachers, something which.

Then, I worked as a secretary for 14 years. I decided to go back to the university to get another degree in English Literature. My dream was to be an active member of the university. However, I have been disappointed by my experience. The professors don't seem to care about their students' needs. They don't seem to be interested in their subjects. The lessons are very monotonous. It's true that we don't expect our professors to always entertain us, but a bit of enthusiasm would be nice. The professors don't seem to encourage us to discuss topics and ask questions. They prefer to dictate their lessons from a piece of paper. This kind of teaching isn't very effective. There's also a lack of communication between students and teachers. It's really hard for students to talk to their professors. I wish they could change this and make the university experience a lot better.

They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions.  Grass has several characteristics that allow it to grow so well and spread so quickly. It has a deep extensive root system and the ability to sprout and regrow from the smallest part of its root system. The leaves of most grass plants are designed to capture light quickly and efficiently. They are long and skinny, designed to maximize surface area. Grasses can grow and spread very quickly. They are among the first plants to colonize an area when it is cleared of other plants. When an area is disturbed, grass can spread and establish itself rapidly because it can germinate from a very small piece of root tissue. Once it is established, grass is very difficult to remove. Both grassland and savanna (or savanna grassland) regions are characterized by a warm, dry climate with a dry winter or wet season. Some of the best grasslands are the cool-season types located in the middle latitudes. Warm-season grasslands are often found along the subtropical belt in the middle latitudes and are generally wetter. All grasslands have three to four months of growth and a dormant period, followed by renewed growth. Grasslands are of two types: 1) Temperate Grasslands: This area lies between 400 and 600 km north and south of the equator. Temperate grasslands include the North American and South American prair.

Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies but the best way to see them is to travel by train.  The name ""Rocky Mountains"" or ""Rockies"" means ""Mountains of Rock."" There are many peaks over 12,000 feet above sea level and some of them are over 14,000 feet. Some of the peaks are among the highest in North America. For example, the highest peak in the contiguous U.S.A is Mount Elbert at 14,433 feet. The area is covered in snow and ice for most of the year and in winter it can become very dangerous with strong winds and avalanches. However, in the summer it is a very popular area for climbers and walkers. There are also large wilderness areas and many national parks. You can travel through the Rockies on the train, on the road or in an aeroplane. The train journey is one of the most popular ways to see the Rockies because you can enjoy the view for hours.

Driving on snow or slush can also be difficult, as it can reduce visibility and make it harder to control your vehicle.

Winter is a difficult time to drive. The weather can change quickly, making roads dangerous. For instance, a storm could come suddenly and cover the road with snow or ice. Rain can also freeze and cause slippery roads. And in poor visibility, like in fog or heavy rain, it is harder to see the road. Even well-trained drivers can have accidents. It is important to be careful when driving in winter, and to take precautions to stay safe. We should plan our trips carefully and check the weather forecast before traveling. Driving in winter is challenging, but with attention and preparation, it can be done safely.

There have been a few changes since the last CD with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums. Moonshine is comprised of: James McKeown and Michael ‘Micky’ Kibblewhite on guitar and vocals, Tom Wilcott on bass and Tom Simpson on drums. They are best known for their energetic stage performances. The first single to be taken from the new album, ‘Here again’, is ‘Satisfied’ a song inspired by the work of the Rolling Stones. ‘It’s easy to be happy in the sunshine but if you’re satisfied you can smile when it rains,’ says McKeown.  The album contains a mix of styles including classic rock’n’roll, rock, rhythm’n’blues and country, with some melodic pop. The band’s manager, Peter Coney, is hoping that the album will attract a wider audience than the previous ones, partly due to the new record company. ‘I believe it will be more successful because of the backing of RCA Records.

They are well prepared for feeding underwater because they can see very well and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food.  Shark skin is made of a type of material called dermal denticles. These little plates cover the body of the shark and make the surface very rough. This is a special adaptation that helps to reduce drag when they swim. The small plates also help the shark hold on to its prey.  Sharks have a body shape that is streamlined which helps them glide smoothly through the water. They also have large, powerful fins that help them swim very fast and turn quickly. Another feature they have to help them is that they can stay under water for a long time without coming up to breathe. This means that they can hunt their prey for longer periods of time.  Some sharks are known as ""ambush predators."" These types of sharks lie in wait near the ocean floor and use their shape, coloring and position in the water to blend in with their surroundings. This allows them to sneak up on prey unsuspectingly.  Not only are sharks predators that eat other marine life, they are also scavengers. This means that they are opportunistic feeders.

B1,"Given this story: The History of Shoes In the past importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today but other materials such as silk plastic or cotton are also popular depending on what is in fashion. The Oldest Shoes: As far back as 8000 years ago ancient people used to wear shoes that were made up of animal skin. Shoes were not really seen as essential until around 4000 BC when people started developing civilisations. In ancient Egypt sandals were popular and most common footwear. Sandals were not just for comfort, but also had a social status. The simple open type was worn by commoners, whereas officials and the royalty had more ornamental ones. In ancient Greece, people would often go barefoot due to the hot climate but when they needed footwear, they wore leather sandals. Men and women wore different types of shoes. Men wore simple leather shoes called ‘anapses’ whereas women wore sandals with high soles that made them appear taller. In the Roman Empire, footwear became more diverse and included types such as sandals, boots, shoes, and high-heeled shoes. Shoe-making became a profession and shoes were made according to one's status in society. During the Middle Ages, shoes were made of leather and had a thick sole for protection. Shoes were usually fastened with leather laces or buckles. The type of shoe you wore would often indicate your social class. During the Renaissance period, shoes became more fashionable. Shoe design became more elaborate with heels, buckles.

B1,"Given this story: The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the ‘famous Ghan’ which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known above all for being late.  The first Ghan train ran in 1878 when the Australian overland telegraph line was constructed from Adelaide to Port Augusta in South Australia and then on to Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory. That line ran for a total of 2870 kilometres and cost AUD 1.2 million. Today the current Ghan train runs for more than 2900 kilometres and passes through areas of stunning scenery as it traverses three states – South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The name Ghan comes from the Afghani camel drivers who were first to make the arduous journey from Adelaide to the goldfields of the Northern Territory with their caravans of camels during the 19th century. In 1929, a train named The Central Australian made the first official journey along the Ghan route. This journey took 67 hours and 43 minutes but on the way home it was 71 hours and 50 minutes. The train did not travel continuously, but paused at remote stations for 56 hours and 36 minutes. I travelled from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south on one of the three weekly trips The Ghan now runs. My journey covered just over 3000 kilometres of spectacular Australian scenery in just over three days.

The Ghan train takes people from the northern part of Australia to the southern part. This train moves across the whole country, from the warm north to the cooler south. It used to be called the famous Ghan, but now it's more known for being late. The first Ghan train was built in 1878 when people needed a way to connect Adelaide to Alice Springs. Today, the Ghan train travels more than 2900 kilometers through beautiful landscapes and crosses three states. The train got its name from the Afghan camel drivers who used to make the long journey with their camels in the 19th century. There were also earlier attempts at running a train on the route, but they had some problems. Nowadays, the Ghan train takes you on a three-day journey from Darwin to Adelaide, covering over 3000 kilometers of stunning Australian landscapes.

The sale had some amazing discounts with a leather sofa priced at £45, but the special offer was only available until 3 a.m. Buyers also had the chance to buy a bed for £30, but again, the offer was only good between 3 a.m. and 8 a.m. The large crowd at the store could be attributed to the economic downturn. With people looking for cheap deals, it’s no wonder that Homestyle was packed with customers. Unfortunately for Homestyle, the furniture store had to close just a few.

Surprisingly although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it was discovered by land rather than by sea. The city was formally founded on June 29, 1776 by a Spanish military commander named Juan Bautista de Anza. He established a fortress on the Presidio Hill in Yerba Buena Cove to provide protection for the Spanish settlements in the area. The city's name was changed to San Francisco in 1846 after an Italian sea captain, named, Juan Francisco de Lezica, who claimed to have discovered the bay which now bears his name. In 1848, following the discovery of gold in nearby Sutter's Mill, San Francisco experienced a population boom. The rush for gold which followed created a city of tents and tarpapered shacks on the shores of the bay.

San Francisco is a city in California, USA. It is by the coast and close to the sea. Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola discovered it in 1769. At first, it was called Yerba Buena Cove. But later, it was renamed after a sea captain, Juan Francisco de Lezica.

In 1776, a Spanish leader, Juan Bautista de Anza, started the city. He built a fort on Presidio Hill to protect the area. The fort is now gone, but it is still an important place in the city.

In 1848, people found gold nearby, so many people came to live there. The city quickly grew big and fast. It became a world financial center. San Francisco is now home to famous places like the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, and many others. There are historical sites, cable cars, and China Town.

In 2003 Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath and come back up to the top without help. Tanya Streeter is not the first person to hold her breath and dive under the waves. Some of the best-documented examples of free-divers are from ancient Egypt, where the practice was believed to be a symbol of physical and spiritual well-being. While the concept of modern competitive free-diving dates back to the late 19th century, it took until the 1970s and 1980s for the sport to evolve into the sport we know today. During the 20th century, freedivers explored the limits of their endurance as they competed on depth and time. But it was not until the late 1990s that the sport reached international prominence, with the creation of the Association Internationale de la Freediving (AIDA), the world body for the sport. Today, freedivers challenge their physical and mental strength by attempting to push themselves to extreme depths and staying underwater for extended periods of time, sometimes for more than two minutes without a breath of air.

In 2003, she broke the world record when she dove 120 metres into the ocean and came back up without any help.

Free-diving is not a new sport. Ancient Egyptians practiced it to show that they were strong and healthy. In the late 1800s, the sport turned into a competition where people would see how deep they could dive and how long they could stay underwater.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the sport changed more and people started to push their limits even further. Finally, in the late 1990s, the Association Internationale de la Freediving was created. This group is now responsible for organising and managing the sport.

Today, free-divers challenge themselves to dive deeper and stay underwater for longer periods of time without breathing. Tanya Streeter is one of the best examples of what people can achieve in this sport. She has shown that with determination and hard work, anything is possible.

Zoos play a very important role in the survival of some animals, many of whom are rare, threatened or even near extinction. They help to maintain genetically diverse populations of these animals, protecting them from the effects of diseases and predators. In addition to the purpose of education, zoos also play a role in research and the development of better husbandry practices that enhance the quality of care for animals in zoo settings. There is ongoing debate about the ethics of zoos. While many people believe that zoos are important in conservation and research, some people think that the stress placed on the animals and the fact that they live in unnatural environments makes them inappropriate. At present, zoos must also meet the challenges posed by the general public's lack of understanding and appreciation of the natural world, and growing pressures on land and resources due to global population growth. In many countries, zoos today also focus on education and conservation through exhibits, interactive experiences and educational programs. They often encourage visitors to.

MONEY Money gives people the freedom to decide what they want to do and it also lets us decide what we want to do and it lets us decide what we want to do and how much time we want to do it in. If you have more money than you can buy more of something you want. Money is also a way of keeping score in a game or a contest. The more points the better you have done. Money can also be used to reward people who have done something well. It can be a motivating force. The more money you earn, the more status you gain in the eyes of others. But money is not the only measure of success. It can bring stress and anxiety. If you don't have money you are poor and you can't do many of the things that you would like to do. But money isn't everything. The richest people in the world are not always the happiest. Money is not everything because it can't buy you love it can't buy you time and it can't buy you health. Money is also not everything because it is a very limited resource. There is only so much of it. This means that there is always going to be competition to get as much of it as you can. It is also a tool for good and a tool for bad. On the one hand, it can be used for good things like buying food and clothes or helping others. On the other hand, it.

Money is the pound, the dollar or the franc. These are just like grams or kilometers, but you can exchange it for something else. Five pounds can buy a book, sweets, or movie tickets. Money gives us the freedom to decide what we want and how we want to spend it. The more money you have, the more you can buy. Money is a way of keeping score in a game, a contest, or rewarding someone who did something well. 

Money can cause stress and anxiety if you don't have much. It can't buy you love, time, or health. There is a limited amount of money, so there's always competition to get it. Money can be used for good things, like food, clothes, and helping others. It can also be used for bad things. Money is important, but it isn't everything. The richest people in the world don't always have happiness. Money isn't the only measure of success. In the end, it's important to remember that money can't buy happiness. 

Remember, money can't buy you health, love or happiness. So, it's important to find balance in life and not rely only on money to make you feel good. Try to focus on what really matters in life, like your relationships and personal growth. These things are more valuable than any amount of money.

It doesn’t happen frequently and when it does the city’s water pipes can’t manage the sudden floods which turn the streets into rivers. But as many winters have remained dry in recent times when the rain does come it is welcomed by the local people.

Majorelle died in 1965 and the garden lay unused for many years until it was bought by fashion designer Yves Saint-Laurent who restored it and gave it to the city of Marrakesh. Today, the Jardin Majorelle is the centre of a complex that includes the Berber Museum which houses the collection of Berber artefacts that once belonged to Majorelle.

B1,"Given this story: HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It consists of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. Honey is produced by bees from the nectar of flowers. It is stored in the bee's stomach and evaporated to produce honey, which is then stored in the honeycomb. Humans eat honey on bread, toast and in drinks. Bees make honey to feed themselves during the cold months, when flowering plants are not in bloom and nectar is not available. Humans eat honey, but bees make it for themselves to eat when there is not much food around. Flightless birds Flightless birds are birds that cannot fly. They are usually found in isolated groups in specific environments. Some examples of flightless birds are the ostrich, the kiwi and the penguin. Flightless birds cannot fly because they don't have the correct bones and muscles to help them do it. Ostriches, for example, have much stronger legs than other birds, which are perfect for running, but not for flying. Food Chains and Food Webs In a food chain, each animal feeds on just one other animal. But in a food web, animals may eat more than one other animal, which can make it more complex.

Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is pretty amazing? Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. But it is the newcomers who are most worth reading. One is the highly talented Rachel Trezise with her short story 'I, Custard' - a sad yet funny tale of a girl growing up in a dead end Welsh town. I haven't stopped talking about it. It's written in a totally unconventional style with brilliant use of language. The same goes for Sarah Waters' story 'Sweetheart'. It also has a Welsh setting (Cardiff) but the themes are different. It is beautifully written, but it's hard to say what it's about - in a way it doesn't matter. 'A Short History of the Long Drop' by Rob Ganley was the last story I read. It is disturbing, dark and violent but in a way very powerful too. For me, it sums up what New Writing 3 is all about: it is brave, it is honest, it is not afraid to take risks.

One night, a man named Dr. Kemp was in his house. The outside lights of the ships shone far away. The big round moon was in the sky with one of its sides hidden. The stars were shining bright in the sky too. 

After five minutes, Dr. Kemp put the window up and began to write again. He was reading a mystery called ""The Mystery of Marie Roget."" It was written by a famous writer, Edgar Allan Poe. This book is called an Ebook, which means you can read it on your computer. 

The man was working on his computer in his house, thinking about the story. The text of the story came from the language transcript. This transcript was prepared by a group of people who volunteered to help with the project. These people also worked together with two big universities. 

The man then saved the work on the computer as the authoritative version for that year. The word ""authoritative"" means that it's the one that other versions of the story follow.

Scientists and researchers worry that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they will not survive for future generations. About 50 percent of the damage is caused by tourists who take a 15 km walk to get there from the nearby town of Tende, in southern France. Researchers have said that the drawings may not survive for future generations.

A large part of the damage is caused by careless tourists who ignore the importance of these ancient drawings. The rocks are found in the French Alps, a range of mountains in southern France. Because of the damage to the rocks, many tourists are starting to express their concern for the preservation of these important works of art.

Avoiding damage to the drawings would require careful walking and refraining from touching them. This would also mean putting up signs at the entrance of Mont Bego warning visitors not to touch the rocks. This way, future generations could still enjoy the drawings carved into these rocks.

Researchers have long been concerned that these ancient drawings are not protected enough and are at risk. Now, with the damage becoming more apparent, they fear that they will not survive for future generations. While there are no specific rules for visiting Mont Bego, any type of tourist could be responsible for ru"

Prepare for Interviews

First impressions count a lot. Scientists have shown we make up our minds about a person quickly – in a few minutes, in fact. We start judging others based on what they look like, how they walk and talk, and how confident they are. 

Tips

1. Dress properly: Be mindful of your appearance, it tells a lot about you. Wear what you think is appropriate for the job, not what you currently wear.

2. Don’t smoke: Don’t indulge in bad habits before an interview. They are not pleasant and leave a bad smell.

3. Test your handshake: Give a firm and friendly handshake. It tells the interviewer that you are capable and confident.

4. Keep eye contact: Look the interviewer in the eye, this shows you are honest and sure of yourself.

5. Speak clearly: Talk in a way that is easy to understand. Not being clear is confusing.

6. Maintain good body language: Sit up straight and maintain a positive posture. Make sure your hands are visible and avoid crossing your arms.

7. Be punctual: Always arrive on time. If you are late, you’re wasting their time, which is disrespectful.

8. Bring multiple resumes: Having additional copies of your resume is helpful in"

The car has left the stage and rolled over in the precipice."" ""Lisbeth!"" cried Raoul, ""Lisbeth!""  Count Philippe turned pale. He did not know the young girl. Raoul ran from the stage.  ""Come, come, everyone,"" said the manager, who had run to the edge of the stage, ""let the carriages go immediately and take everyone home. The performance cannot continue this evening, everyone must go."" And he waved his hands and there was a movement of the crowd which hurried toward the exits. Count Philippe did not leave immediately. He stayed a little, alone, looking at the precipice. Then he went back in a carriage to his palace. And as for Lisbeth, he did not know where she had gone, and he would never know. She had disappeared from the face of the earth for him, as if she had never existed. He tried to find out about her. There was nothing. No one knew anything of her. It was as if she had never been born. But when he arrived at the place in the Bois de Boulogne where he had seen her that day when they had gone for a walk, there was a plaque on a tree. It said that she had been killed in an accident. He had wanted to marry her, to make her his.

Raoul and a famous Count, Count Philippe, were performing in a play at the theatre. Everyone was enjoying the show until Raoul suddenly shouted in surprise and distress. Count Philippe looked panicked and rushed to a window in his private box to see what was happening. He was horrified to see that a car had crashed off the stage and rolled down a steep cliff. He did not know the girl driving the car, Lisbeth, but he felt terrible for her.

Rudolphe, another character in the play, was very pale. He coldly announced that the accident had happened, and the play could not continue. The manager of the theatre then came on stage, panicking. He called for everyone to leave the theatre immediately and head home. The crowd in the audience quickly obeyed, and soon the theatre was empty.

Count Philippe did not leave the theatre straight away. He stood and watched the place where the accident had happened, lost in thought. Eventually, he left, traveling back to his palace, still worried about the girl he had never really known.

Lisbeth was sadly gone, as if she had never existed. No one knew anything about her, or where she had come from. Count Philippe wanted to find out more about her, to maybe find some sort of closure.

B2,"Given this story: Over the past fifteen years my research has documented that for many online life and smartphone connections have got in the way of things that people feel are important. We're so busy communicating that we don't have time to think we don't have time to sit down and have a conversation. Talking to and with each other is seen to be more important than listening to and with each other. In fact the way we are using digital communication to connect with each other means we're creating a culture in which silence is considered unfriendly. As a result, we have become a nation of compulsive communicators, constantly reaching out, connected yet isolated, unable to let go of the need to be in contact and in doing so, losing the art of conversation. This book explores the impact of these technological developments on our society and asks what are the consequences for face-to-face conversations, and for the quality of our relationships. I am not alone in saying this. Sherry Turkle, a psychologist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has spent the last few decades studying the impact of technology on interpersonal relationships. She says that, while we know we're not really communicating, we continue to overestimate the value of the connections we make on Facebook and other social media platforms. We are beginning to recognise that the way we use our smartphones and other technologies, coupled with our addiction to digital social networking sites, is damaging the quality of our communications with each other. It means we are not in the moment, our mind is often elsewhere and our conversations are shallow, superficial and often unfulfilling. This problem isn't just happening to us: it's happening to our children.

Over the past fifteen years, my research has shown that technology often gets in the way of important things in life. We spend too much time using smartphones and the internet. This makes us forget how to have real talks with friends and family. Instead, we just chat quickly and don't really listen to each other. Now, being quiet is seen as being unfriendly. 

As a result, we have become obsessed with talking and connecting with others all the time, even if these connections are shallow. Sherry Turkle, a psychologist at MIT, says we still think that these connections are valuable. However, we know they aren't. Our obsession with digital communication is hurting the quality of our relationships. We're losing the art of conversation. 

We now recognise that using smartphones, social media and other technology is causing problems in our communication. It's stopping us from being in the moment. So, we spend too much time texting and checking social media, and not enough time talking to people face-to-face. 

We need to spend more time having meaningful conversations with each other. Otherwise, these problems with communication will affect not just us, but also our children. Let's not lose the quality of our conversations and relationships. Instead, let's work together to find a better balance between using technology and having meaningful talks with others.

B2,"Given this story: Hamlet was angry that she should give such a dear and respectful name as father to the murderer of his true father and he replied sharply 'Mother you have much offended my father.' The queen asked him if he had forgotten who he was speaking to. 'Oh!' replied Hamlet. 'I wish I could forget. Rita Young: Why did Hamlet tell his mother that she was a whore? The answer is: Hamlet told his mother she was a whore because he was angry and frustrated with the fact that she had married his uncle and the man who killed his father. He viewed her as having betrayed his father's memory and shamed his family, and his anger and hurt were strong enough to make him use harsh language with her. The term ""whore"" is a metaphor for her betrayal, as he feels she has sold herself for her own benefit. In this scene, Hamlet is using strong language to express his grief and anger. It's a reflection of his deep emotional turmoil and disillusionment with the adults around him. He is not thinking clearly, and he is acting out of pain. As a character, Hamlet is known for his complex emotions and his tendency to overreact. It's important to note that Hamlet's harsh words to his mother are not meant to be taken literally. Instead, they are an expression of his emotional pain and his struggle to come to terms with his father's death. Ultimately, Hamlet's outburst shows how deeply he is hurting and how much he misses his father. He is reacting to the situation with extreme emotional intensity, a common characteristic of his personality as described in the play. Hamlet's words are not reflective of his.

Talking about their experiences running a business in the countryside, five women discuss their ventures. Christine Hogan operates a computer-aided design firm that generates more than £200,000 in annual revenue and employs four full-time staff. After moving away from London due to work demands and their young children, they settled down 15 miles away from the nearest city. Their relocation was advantageous, as work connections were maintained through e-mails and the internet. They enjoy participating in local activities, like organizing fairs, and serving on school committees. Though Christine would have preferred working closely with people from the village, her business success allows her to live in the countryside and carry out work she would normally do in a city.

Nicola Baker, who manages a company that hires staff for exhibitions, says, 'I can work in my dressing gown.' She started her business venture due to personal connections in the industry, but found it difficult to find employment. Her company is a result of her determination to utilize her industry knowledge and connections.

In the country, the pace of life is generally slower, and starting a business can be simpler than in the city. For example, office space and commercial rental costs are often lower. However, it may be more difficult to find the right skilled workforce or meet suppliers due to location. Balancing work and personal life can be"
B2,"Given this story: Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves. In On the Origin of Species published in 1859 Darwin described the process of natural selection. The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. A These plants or animals pass on their advantageous traits to their offspring, enabling those offspring to survive. Over many generations, the fittest animals and plants become more dominant in the population, and their characteristics become more widespread. This, Darwin argued, is the mechanism that drives the evolution of all life on Earth. It was a simple yet radical idea, especially for its time. Darwin didn't invent the idea of evolution, but he provided a new explanation for it. His ideas were groundbreaking, but also controversial. Some people found the idea hard to accept. They did not like the idea that humans were just animals and that we are connected to every living thing on Earth. Darwin's work was controversial, but also very important. He opened our eyes to the incredible diversity and complex history of life on Earth. His research still affects our understanding of biology and evolution today. Many of Darwin's ideas were only confirmed with the discovery of DNA in the 20th century. DNA is like a set of instructions that tells living things how to develop, survive, and reproduce. Comparing DNA from different species is how scientists find out how closely related they are to one another. The closer two species' DNA is, the more recently they share a common ancestor. This evidence shows that all living things are related to each other. Humans are no exception. We are connected to every living thing on Earth and share a common ancestor.

Charles Darwin, a well-known scientist in 1809 to 1882, came up with a big new idea that helped us understand the world and our place in it. In a very famous book called On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, he talked about how nature chooses which animals and plants live, reproduce, and pass on their traits. Darwin explained that animals and plants with traits best suited to their environment have a better chance to survive and have kids. These kids inherit their parents' good traits and survive, too. Over time, this causes animals and plants that are the most suited to their environment to become more common. This idea revolutionized our understanding of life on Earth. Although Darwin did not invent the idea of evolution, he provided a new way of explaining it. Some people found his theory hard to accept and did not like the idea that humans are just animals, connected to every other living thing on Earth. Regardless, Darwin's work was very important. It opened our eyes to the incredible diversity of life on Earth. His research is still very important for understanding biology and evolution today.

But now it was not the world's only network of computers. After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful other networks began to appear. NARRATOR: The first of these other networks was called the SNDnet or the Source Network. The SNDnet was formed in 1970 as a research project and was a commercial operation, the first of its kind. It was owned and operated by a man named Bob Metcalfe. The SNDnet connected about 50 companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the first companies connected to the SNDnet was a company that made computer hardware, called SRI. SRI connected to the ARPAnet but the connection was a private connection, not part of the SNDnet. Now SNDnet was a bit of a failure as a company, but it was successful as a concept. The SNDnet showed that other networks could exist, and that they could be useful. The SNDnet also played an important role in the history of the Internet because it was the birthplace of another company called 3Com. 3Com was formed by Bob Metcalfe in 1979. Today 3Com is one of the largest network companies in the world. In the beginning of the Internet, before it was called the Internet, there was an email system used by the ARPAnet. This email system was a message board, which was used to send messages around the ARPAnet. The email system was a way for people to communicate, but it was not the same as the email we use today.

In the beginning, there was a network called ARPAnet. Many problems happened during its creation. However, the guests at the conference were surprised by the network. After this event, ARPAnet started to grow very fast. The ARPAnet wasn't the only network in the world anymore. Other networks appeared because people saw that a computer network could be useful.

One of these new networks was SNDnet, which started in 1970. It was owned by a man named Bob Metcalfe. SNDnet had about 50 members in the San Francisco area. SRI, a company that made computer parts, joined SNDnet. But SRI already had a private connection to the ARPAnet.

SNDnet wasn't very successful as a company, but it showed that other networks were possible. This led to the creation of 3Com, a big network company that still exists today.

'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall.  Chris’s growth had started about a year after he had a polio type virus. Today Chris is an incredible seven feet tall and he’s no exception. The record for the tallest man in the world currently stands at 8 foot 11, which was set by Robert Wadlow in 1940. So how tall will our giant children be in thirty years? We can only guess... It is a fact that children have been growing taller for the last 5000 years, so that over a period of just a few hundred years, their growth has been accelerated by about ten per cent. The average height of men in most European countries and in the US is now over six feet. If this trend continues, then in the next fifty years it’s possible that the average height of men will increase to seven feet. So where does this increased height come from? It comes from food – specifically the fact that we eat more now than we did in the past. This might seem obvious, but the fact is that the more people eat, the more they grow. Food and height go together in a straightforward way, but there is a more indirect way in which this happens. The food that our ancestors ate wasn’t as nutritious as the food that we eat today. In the past they were more likely to suffer from malnutrition, or not have enough to eat, but with improvements in agriculture and food production, this is.

When Chris was fourteen, he told his careers advisor that he wanted to join the navy. 'What do you want to be?' the teacher asked. 'The flagpole on a ship?’ the teacher pointed out that Chris was already very tall at almost two metres. Chris’s growth began a year after he had a virus similar to polio. Today, Chris is seven feet tall - and he’s not the only one. The tallest man ever, Robert Wadlow, was eight feet and eleven inches tall. When he set the record in 1940, people were much smaller, on average. The average height of men has increased a lot since then. In fact, in most European countries and the US, the average height for men is over six feet. If people continue to grow this way, in fifty years, the average height might be seven feet tall. So, why have people become so much taller? It has to do with what they eat. Over the past 5000 years, people have grown taller as they’ve eaten more. So, it seems that eating more food leads to being taller. But there’s another connection, too. The food people ate in the past wasn't as nutritious as the food we eat today. This is because the food now is better for us and has more nutrients in it. Because of improvements in farming and food production, we"

Nearly fifteen years later nobody has beaten that time. Have we got to the human speed limit? Dr Frances Ashcroft Professor of Physiology at Oxford University explains the limits of the human body during a race.  It's a little bit difficult to know what the perfect race strategy would be because nobody has been able to beat Hicham El Guerrouj’s record, but it depends on how you train. Some athletes will train at a very slow pace because it's a very long race and they want to save their energy. Others might say, ""I'm going to do a lot of interval training and I'm going to make sure I get up to that pace during the race."" The limits are really what your body can do. The best 1,500 meters runners out there have very efficient circulatory systems and very efficient muscles, they're probably a little bit more flexible than the average person and they will be using anaerobic energy very efficiently. The physiological limits are really about the capacity of the heart to pump blood, the capacity of the lungs to deliver oxygen to the muscles, and the capacity of the muscles to burn fuel in an efficient way. You could actually make more energy in the muscles, but if you don’t get enough oxygen to the muscle or you're not pumping the blood around quickly enough to get it to the muscle, it just won’t produce as much energy. There are things that would help to overcome physiological limits. We don't understand everything about how the body does this yet, but for example, if you were to.

Dr. Frances Ashcroft, Professor of Physiology at Oxford University, explains the limits of the human body during a race. We don't know the perfect race strategy because nobody has beaten Hicham's record. Race strategies depend on training. Some athletes run slow to save energy, while others train with fast interval runs. Hicham's record limits are based on the body's ability. The best runners have efficient circulatory systems, good muscles, and use anaerobic energy efficiently. The limits are about the heart's ability to pump blood, lungs' ability to deliver oxygen, and muscles' ability to burn fuel efficiently. More energy could be made in muscles but if there isn't enough oxygen or blood isn't pumped fast enough, the muscle won't produce as much energy.

Some of us are shopaholics and love to buy lots of things. While others only go shopping when we have a specific need. There are also those who enjoy shopping for special, unique, or one-of-a-kind items. We may visit shops only occasionally or a few times a month. There are those who don't find pleasure in shopping and prefer other activities.

We can ask people to get an idea of the kind of shoppers they are. For example, Melanie, a 22-year-old dancer, said she's an addict. She enjoys spending her money and goes shopping whenever she has cash.

On the other hand, Chris, a 27-year-old writer, finds shopping boring. He only visits shops when he needs something specific. He can manage even if he doesn't find what he's looking for. Chris only goes shopping about three times a year.

Some of us, like Nick, a 19-year-old student, consider shopping a social event. He enjoys meeting his friends and spending time together. They often visit other cities for the day, browsing and buying anything that catches their eye.

Lisa, a 29-year-old teacher, goes shopping when she needs to, and she finds it relaxing. She goes"

Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill.  After the discovery of how to make ice skates from iron, they spread quickly. Iron skates changed the character of the sport, allowing skating on more types of ice and making it much faster. Skating became a competitive sport in Europe. Skates with metal blades were in common use in England in the 16th and 17th centuries.  Early skating boots had very simple construction and were made of soft leather. In the 18th century the steel blade was invented. This made skating a far quicker activity. It also meant that more skaters could be accommodated. With the increasing popularity of the sport many new styles of ice skates and blades emerged, and they were all suited to different environments. Skaters began to develop their own personal style of skating.  As well as becoming more popular the skating population grew. This was partly due to the increasing popularity of the sport in general, and partly due to better construction and the resulting increased durability of skates.  The invention of the refrigerated ice rink was.

Ice skating is an activity that has been enjoyed for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found proof of this in the form of ancient skates that were made from animal bone. It is thought that these skates were used until a new material became available in about the year 200 AD. This material was iron, which came from Scandinavia. In those times, it was very important for the people who had money to know how to skate. This was because it showed that they were good at other things that required skill and practice.

After the people figured out how to make skates out of iron, they became very popular very quickly. This is because iron made it possible to skate on a wider variety of surfaces and also to move a lot faster. Because of this, ice skating became a competitive sport in Europe. It was also popular in England in the 16th and 17th centuries, which is a long time ago.

People who skated in the past wore boots that were very simple and made out of leather. Later, in the 18th century, steel blades were developed. This allowed skaters to go even faster. It also meant that more people could learn how to skate since the skates were sturdier and lasted longer.

As more and more people started to skate, there were a lot of different styles of skates that were created."

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because 'it's fun'. A teenage girl with a passion for endurance activities is looking for someone to train with. She is an excellent athlete who may become an Olympic champion one day. Ideally, her training partner should be female and equally enthusiastic about distance running (such as 15km sessions), distance swimming (with a love for winter training in cold rivers), and distance cycling (preferring to bike for 100km).

Without a doubt, at the age of 15, Daisy Pearce is already the fastest girl in Britain. She has achieved the national title for 10km running, beating a field of 4,000 adults. She ranks third in the country for swimming and is one of the UK's top triathletes, finishing in the top three in Europe last year. In fact, this year she became the youngest British competitor in an international triathlon held in France. Her goal is to qualify for the 2016 Olympic triathlon in Rio de Janeiro.

B2,"Given this story: We are literally drowning in news. Have you ever tried reading the whole newspaper including the financial and sports pages? Or have you followed every piece of news on the front page of a news website? It's practically impossible. Reuters alone puts out 3.5 million news stories a year. And that's just one source.  It's a simple math problem: the more news we have, the less likely we are to see the really important stuff. It's just like trying to find a specific book in a library. The more books are in there, the longer it takes to find what you're looking for. So how do we keep up to date on the issues that matter to us most? We use tools designed to filter out the noise and show us the information we really need to see. That's where the ""curation"" part of a curation platform comes in. We have to filter out the information that is not useful or relevant to us, so we can concentrate on the things that really matter. When a friend recommends a book, a movie or a blog, we trust their judgment and make time for those things because we know they are worth it. The same goes for news curation: when an expert or algorithm recommends news stories, we are likely to trust their judgment and read those stories.  For many people, curation platforms offer a way to stay up to date with what is happening in their world, by choosing the right information for them, based on their personal preferences. Curating news means to take time, to engage with your sources, to understand your audience and, most importantly, to find the stories that matter. The rise of the curation platform reflects a wider trend that has been taking.

We live in a world where it seems there is too much information to take in. Have you ever tried reading the whole newspaper or all the headlines on a news website? It's very hard. There's so much news that we might miss the most important stories. It's like looking for a special book in a library full of books. The more books there are, the longer it takes to find what we're looking for. So how can we stay informed about the things that really matter to us? We need help to find the news and information that we need. This is called news curation.

Curation is a way to sort through the mess of information and show us the stuff that is important. Imagine if a friend recommends a book, a movie, or a blog because they know you will like them. You can trust your friend's judgment and make time to read or watch these things because you know they are worth it. The same goes for news curation: if an expert or a computer program suggests news stories, we are likely to trust them and read those stories.

News curation platforms can help people stay updated on what is happening in the world. They choose news based on people's preferences, so that they only see what's important to them. Curating news means taking the time to understand where the news comes from and who the audience is. The goal is to find the news stories that really"

""My Journey to Becoming a Film Critic""

My name is Mark Adams, and I have been writing about movies for over ten years. Before working for The Front Page, I wrote articles for other newspapers and magazines. But writing for The Front Page was my first big job.

I started writing for many different publications, including The Independent, The Daily Mirror, and The Guardian. I also wrote for some magazines like Esquire and Sight & Sound.

In 2015, I wrote a book called ""The Front Page: How I became a film critic."" This book tells the story of how I became a film critic at age 27. I loved movies and wanted to share that love with other people.

Working for The Front Page was very important for me. It helped me become a good film critic and opened many doors for me. I am very thankful for that opportunity.

Now, I continue to write about movies and share my passion with others. It's been a wonderful journey, and I look forward to writing more reviews in the future.

Remember, if you love something, share it with the world. Happy movie watching!

When I was a kid, I first visited Lastingham when I was eight years old. It was in a lovely valley surrounded by hills and had an old ruined abbey. It's not the empty deserts that attract me but the villages with old buildings, like Lastingham.

A: The most nerve-wracking aspect of the trip was the actual diving part. Alvin is an aluminum submersible that descends to the ocean floor by being lowered by a rope. To enter the submersible, I had to be winched down into the Alvin from the deck of the ship. The descent took about half an hour and the descent was pretty scary. Q: Do you remember a time when you were particularly nervous while diving? A: The first time I dived I was very nervous as it was a totally new experience. I was worried about diving with a re-breather in case I blacked out. Also, I had a fear of deep waters, which I wanted to overcome. Q: How did you overcome these fears? A: The most important thing is to have faith in.

A: The scariest part was the diving. To enter the submersible Alvin, I had to be winched from the ship's deck down into the sub. The descent took about 30 minutes, and that was really scary.

Q: Do you remember a time when you felt very nervous during a dive?
A: The first time I ever dove, I was really frightened because it was a new experience. I was worried about using a re-breather, and I was also anxious about deep water, which I wanted to face.

Legally it belonged to the People's Republic of China a part of the colony that was never British. In fact neither Chinese nor British law had effect there. Britain had established itself in Hong Kong, a fishing village, in 1841. In 1898, after the Chinese army invaded, Britain annexed the New Territories, which included Kowloon, and leased it from China until 1997. In 1987 the British government signed a historic handover agreement, which saw the Chinese government take over control of Hong Kong in 1997. The British government was reluctant to make too many plans for the territory and had left it to the Chinese government to decide what to do with it. After a brief military rule, the government handed over the administration of the territory to the former colonial rulers, with the promise to have the place back by the year 1997. From 1988 the Chinese government slowly started the process of reunification with the motherland. There were many who opposed this merging of the two worlds but it was a necessary step to avoid Hong Kong becoming a lawless territory. With the change in administration, many of the old traditions, like gambling and prostitution, were outlawed but this did not affect the people who lived in the Walled City and its like. To this day the walled city still stands as one of the most unusual and unique places in the world. There are very few places where people can live above the law and not have to worry about being arrested.

Kowloon Walled City was a famous place in Hong Kong with strange rules. It had no wall around it, even though its name says ""walled"" city. The buildings just rose like pancakes, up to fourteen floors high! People lived in them, but these buildings were not part of Hong Kong officially. Instead, it was a part of China that Britain got when they took over a long time ago. They didn't know what to do with it, so they just gave it to China in 1997. 

When China took over, they made some new rules. Gambling and prostitution used to be normal there, but not anymore. However, people in the Walled City didn't have to worry about these new rules. They lived free from trouble, away from the rest of Hong Kong.

Even today, the Kowloon Walled City still exists, showing a little corner of Hong Kong where people can live happily without the need to follow every rule. It's a rare place, a special spot in the world. Not many people can say they live above the law, without the need to worry about the police. The Walled City stands tall and proud, showing the world what life can be like when you live outside the rules. 

So, the Kowloon Walled City is a special place, a unique spot in the world, where the old ways still"

For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land.  ## A brief history of the village Then came the moment of inspiration - a visionary idea that this could be transformed into something special and that the village could be developed as an ideal showplace to help raise funds for children’s charities. A little bit of time, a lot of hard work and a few pounds were all that was required. And with those ingredients the concept of the Model Village was born. ## The making of the village The process of putting together such a project was something of a rollercoaster ride, with a few hair-raising moments along the way. But with a team of dedicated people who shared the vision and put their backs into the project it all came together. As you walk around the village you can see how the project has developed over the years. There are buildings from different periods from Tudor to the 21st century, each one of them lovingly constructed and full of intricate details. As you stroll down the streets you will find that the Model Village is not just a static display, but is alive with movement and even the sound of the sea. ## Charity The village is run entirely by volunteers and is a registered charity that gives all its income to local children’s charities. There are always new projects being planned, so if you would like to get involved, come and see us. You are welcome to join us, whether you are an expert or.

Welcome to the Model Village. When you first get there, it is hard to believe that only a few years ago this place was covered in weeds and brambles. It was just a piece of unused land. For many years, people thought it was worthless. 

## A Little History of the Village 

Then someone had a great idea. Why not turn this land into something wonderful and use the Model Village to raise money for children's charities? Just a little time, some hard work, and a bit of money would be all it took. So the idea of the Model Village was born. 

## How the Village Was Made 

Creating a project like this was both fun and challenging. There were some difficult moments along the way. But with a group of dedicated people who believed in the idea, they made it happen. 

As you walk around the village, you can see how it has grown and changed over the years. The buildings are from different times, including Tudor and 21st century. All of them are carefully built and full of little details.

Confident people: their secret is what? Most people believe that confident individuals are like that since birth. However, this is far from the truth as many confident people have worked hard to attain that self-assuredness in their lives. So, how did these individuals manage to overcome their fears and insecurities, and eventually become self-confident? Let's explore the stories of five such people and learn about their experiences.

Meet Jenny. She was once a very shy young girl who always thought she would remain that way. However, she was determined to be more confident. So, she took things into her own hands and started doing things that seemed difficult for her. She began with standing up in front of people and speaking. Now, she has become a successful manager and communicates with people all day long. Just as she mentioned, ""Being confident isn't something you're born with. It's something you learn.""

Old trees overhang the stream half shading shallow water. Soft greens mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze. Charlie tells me that kingfishers are solitary and are hard to spot even if you know where they are. One of their tricks is that they will fly in a straight line, only to turn at the last moment and vanish, as if they have never flown that way before. This is a great advantage for fishing in streams, and one of the reasons for their beautiful feathers. The bird is built for speed and precision, and it knows its patch well, hunting along a section of river. Kingfishers have a distinctive flight pattern, and Charlie says they often hover in the same place for a while and will fly very low and very fast down the middle of the stream. It is in this moment that a photo opportunity may present itself. The bird will then drop rapidly out of the water, and then fly up to rest and wait for its next prey. Charlie tells me that he has seen kingfishers fly up and catch prey such as dragonflies, but mostly they feed on fish. He explains that the colourful plumage of the male kingfisher is part of its hunting strategy. The brilliant blue of a male kingfishers throat and undercarriage makes it almost invisible as it hovers over a fish, while the striking breast flashes at just the right moment as it dives, startling its prey into a fatal moment of distraction.

Charlie James is a wildlife photographer. He knows a lot about kingfishers: blue-green birds that live by streams and rivers. They eat fish. He says they like to hunt around sections of rivers and live in old trees. They live close to the water, and in between the sun and shade. Kingfishers are alone and can be hard to see. They can fly fast and straight, changing direction suddenly. This helps them catch fish. Kingfishers have special feathers. They look colorful and beautiful. The blue color is like a camouflage (the color makes them invisible). Their special plumage (their beautiful feathers) have an important role in their hunting. Charlie explains that the male kingfisher has a blue throat and underside. This color makes it nearly invisible. Also, its flashy breast stuns the prey, making it less careful and easier to catch. He says he has seen the birds catch things like dragonflies, but their main food is fish. The male kingfisher's brilliant blue throat and undercarriage help it to surprise the fish when it dives, which increases its chances to catch more fish and feed better. Charlie also says that he has been lucky to see kingfishers fly up, catch prey, and then fly down and rest. In the end, they wait again for another prey. Their flight is different and interesting.

B2,"Given this story: It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. Chris had already known for many years he had a condition called Gigantism. It’s a rare genetic disorder that occurs before puberty when a non-cancerous tumour forms in the pituitary gland. This causes the overproduction of the growth hormone – which leads to abnormal growth. Chris was also suffering from acromegaly, a condition that develops after puberty when the pituitary gland keeps producing growth hormone even when it shouldn’t. Because of this he is now 2.47 metres tall - almost two feet taller than the average man. But life is not all about big steps - it is about the small ones we all take every day. Chris started school 6 years late because of his size and had his own set of bespoke school uniform pants because he couldn’t find off the shelf pants that fit. As a kid, he was also a bit of a nightmare. He would break the swing in the playground and sit down with other boys to watch TV and find himself towering over the backs of their chairs. His nickname at school was “Elephant Legs” and he was often ridiculed. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 56 and his mother died aged 44 from a brain tumour. Chris was in bed, suffering from a terrible toothache when his mother passed away and, he says, he.

The original story is about Chris Greener who always wanted to join the navy. He started school at the age of ten and is already two meters tall because of a disease called Gigantism. When he was fourteen, his teacher asked him what he wanted to be. He answered, “the flagpole on a ship.” The teacher joked with him because of his height. Chris has an additional health problem called acromegaly. It happens when the pituitary gland continues to create growth hormones that make him even taller, even after puberty. Because of this condition, he now stands at 2.47 meters tall. That's two feet more than an average person. However, Chris knows that life is not just about tall steps; it is also about the small steps we take every day. When he was at school, he needed special school uniforms because his legs were too long for regular clothes. Because of his size, he often caused problems at school. Other kids laughed at him and called him “Elephant Legs”. He even broke the swing in the school playground and had to sit down among other kids while watching TV so that he could fit. Chris’s father died when he was 56 and his mother passed away when he was 44. Unfortunately, his mother died when Chris was in bed with a bad toothache.

B2,"Given this story: GM's clever EN-V concept is a two-wheeled two-seater solution to urban transport. Telegraph Motoring's Mike Rutherford has a preview and takes it for a spin. That's because of the nature of the EN-V. Last week I drove one of these though it was more like flying a small plane than driving. General Motors is banking heavily on the little electric one-seater to be the future of urban transport and the way it works is a bit out of the ordinary, to put it mildly. The EN-V is a two-seater, with space for a passenger and driver, mounted on two large 19-inch wheels. It is 7ft long, 4ft wide and 3.5ft high and you get inside by sliding the whole body upwards on its wheels. To steer, you pull or push a joystick. To accelerate or decelerate, you twist a large knob that also switches between drive and ""park"" mode. To reverse, it does a full 180-degree U-turn. The first thing you need to know is that the concept version I drove was a little different from the one you'll eventually get to buy. This was a prototype that GM had been playing with to see how the system works, because it's the most difficult part of the job to get right. I started out at 3mph because I couldn't work out how to get it out of park mode, but soon picked it up, though I had to have a few go-rounds before I got it to 180mph. It is very quiet, apart from a constant whirring noise that is the sound of the electric prop.

The EN-V, General Motors's (GM) latest transport concept is perfect for tackling urban congestion. Motoring writer Mike Rutherford offers a first-hand account of this interesting, two-wheeled, two-seater innovation. This is something unique in the world of transport. The EN-V uses electric power and is designed to make a major difference to urban transport. Imagine a vehicle which is 7ft long, 4ft wide and 3.5ft high, with two big 19-inch wheels! With the EN-V, you step inside by lifting the whole body up on its wheels. To navigate, you use a joystick to steer and a knob to control speed. Reverse is achieved with a full 180-degree turn. The EN-V in its current form is quite different from the eventual retail version. It's a prototype GM is experimenting with. While the driving may be unconventional, it's surprisingly easy to master once you're accustomed to it. One small quirk: it was impossible to move at first, because I was unsure how to exit park mode. That's what makes this story so interesting. At its top speed, the electric EN-V can reach up to 180mph, although it's more suited to short distances. It's as quiet as a whisper"

B2,"Given this story: What would happen to our planet if humans were to suddenly disappear? This is the basic hypothesis behind Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us. Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear. In one chapter there is an analysis of how New York would survive if there were no humans to take care of it.  This question seems fitting as we are currently experiencing a global pandemic which could result in the deaths of millions.  In addition, there is an increasing debate around the world about whether or not to reduce the human population to save the Earth. Some believe this will help slow global warming and stop mass extinction of plants and animals. Others believe that it is against human rights and that resources can be properly managed to provide sustainable living for all. On this site, we can imagine what the Earth would look like if it was devoid of human beings. As the 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer wrote, ""There are three stages in the life of a man. He has first his childhood, then his youth, and then his manhood; and these correspond to the three stages of a river, which are its infancy, its youth, and its old age."" Humankind, as a whole, is in its manhood stage. We are still growing but at a slower rate than in our youth. Our civilization is beginning to decay and we are beginning to disappear from the world. This process will take some time but it is inevitable. It is estimated that humanity has been on the Earth for about 200,000 years. For about 99% of that time, we were hunter-gatherers living in relative harmony with the rest of the natural world..

What would happen to our planet if humans suddenly disappeared? This is the basic idea behind a book by Alan Weisman called The World Without Us. The book looks at how long it would take for the Earth to show no signs of humans having lived on it.

This question is relevant as we are currently facing a global pandemic that could cause millions of deaths. There is an ongoing debate across the world about whether reducing the human population would help save the planet.

B2,"Given this story: SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour.  There are a range of specialist music schools and programmes available to support the development of musical talent. Enrolling children in these can provide an opportunity for them to develop, express and enjoy their passion for music in a supportive and encouraging environment. It also allows them to progress through a structured programme of learning, ensuring a firm foundation in music theory and technique. However, there can be drawbacks as well as advantages to enrolling your child in a specialist music school. Here are some things to consider: 1.  Time commitment and travel: Specialist music schools often require a significant time commitment in terms of both rehearsal and theory lessons. You will need to consider how much time your child can realistically spend in music school and how you will manage the additional time commitment for travel and preparation. 2.  Pressure and expectations: Children attending specialist music schools may experience increased pressure to succeed, to progress quickly or to achieve high levels of performance. It’s important to think about how your child will cope with this pressure, as well as whether or not they will be motivated by it. 3.  Financial implications: The cost of attending a specialist music school can be high. You will need to consider your financial situation and how you will manage this additional cost. 4.  Support and development: While your child will be exposed to expert tuition and guidance at a specialist music school, this does not guarantee that they will succeed.

Children may display outstanding abilities in music from a very young age. Parents may not always know how to support their child's talent and can easily miss the signs of their child's musical needs. This may lead to the child becoming frustrated and acting out in challenging behaviour.

To help with this, there are special music schools available to cater for children who have a natural gift for music. These schools provide a safe and supportive environment for children to explore and develop their musical abilities.

The music schools usually follow a structured curriculum, which includes learning music theory and techniques. However, there are some considerations when thinking about enrolling your child in a music school.

One thing to think about is the time commitment required. Music schools often take up a lot of time, including travelling to and from classes. This may affect the amount of time the child has to spend in other activities.

Another thing to consider is the pressure that children may experience at music schools. They may feel they must perform at their best, or progress quickly. You should think about how your child will cope with such expectations and whether it will motivate them.

The cost of music schools is also a factor. You will need to assess your financial situation and decide whether you can afford this additional expense.

In conclusion, while music schools provide a great opportunity for children to excel in their musical talents, they may not guarantee success. There are still challenges and"

B2,"Given this story: Drop me a line! In our fast world of phones fax machines and computers the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing altogether. Yet to me there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival the pleasure of seeing who it is from and finally the enjoyment of the contents.  In a similar way to the art of letter writing the tradition of the pen name is one that is becoming increasingly rare. The idea of taking on a pen name (or pseudonym) was once seen as an exciting and interesting way to allow people to express themselves in different forms or to hide their true identity.  Whether it was out of fear of persecution for their political or religious beliefs or the embarrassment of revealing the contents of their writing the pen name served as a barrier to their true identity.  In many cases the individual behind the pen name was not known for many years and sometimes until their death. The pen name is a fascinating aspect of the author and is something which I have chosen to use for myself. I hope that by choosing to use this name it will enable me to explore subjects that I may not otherwise feel comfortable about. This name allows me to be able to express my views and ideas more freely whilst still remaining an individual who can have a private life.  This name also enables me to develop my own style as a writer, to experiment and learn from my experiences without the constraints of having to be true to a certain image or reputation. Ultimately the pen name is a tool that can offer both the reader and the writer freedom. It allows the writer to express thoughts and ideas that may not be acceptable in the society that they live in or in the literary world that they are part of. It also offers the reader the opportunity.

Letters and secrets

Nowadays, people send many messages using the computer, telephone, or fax. But there is still something special about receiving a letter. I like to see who the letter is from and read what's inside. A long time ago, many authors used a pen name. They wanted to keep their real name secret. This gave them a chance to express themselves and share different views. They could do this without others knowing who they were.

This tradition is disappearing nowadays. But it's still interesting! It gave authors the freedom to write things they couldn't say with their real name. Sometimes, they did this because they didn't agree with their society. But other times, they felt that their work wouldn't be taken seriously under their real name. Pen names allowed authors to try different styles and ideas, too.

Many readers enjoyed finding out who wrote their favorite books. It was fun to discover the true identity of a writer. Some authors kept their secret for years. Others didn't reveal their real name until they died.

I choose to write under a pen name. It makes me feel free to express my own thoughts. I can also be more private and have a real life. I can also try new styles without worrying about others' opinions. Using a pen name helps me and my readers! It gives both of us a chance to enjoy the magic of letters.

Georgina Ferry I am curious to know what reaction this produces and have found it fascinating. Most people have never heard of her, though occasionally someone will say they have read about her in the newspaper. Then, after a moment's thought, they generally say something like: 'But who is she?' 'The first woman and the first Briton to win a Nobel prize for Chemistry, a pioneering researcher into insulin, a scientist who has helped save the sight of thousands of children and who, as a Quaker pacifist, declined to take up her prize for fear it would encourage the manufacture of even more deadly weapons,' I explain to my bemused questioner. Only when I tell them the full story do some of them admit that they have heard of her. For the past four years I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. It's simple, but it's brilliant.

Dorothy Hodgkin, the only British woman to have won a Nobel prize in Chemistry, should be a well-known person in the UK. However, very few people know who she is. In the past four years, Georgina Ferry, the author of the first biography about her life, has made people guess her profession and achievements through a simple test. Ferry has been asked, when she tells them she's writing a biography of Dorothy, if they know who she is. When they say they have read something about her in the newspaper but don't know who she is, Ferry tells them about her achievements. These include being the first female and first British person to win a Nobel prize for her work in Chemistry, her groundbreaking research in insulin and her contribution to saving thousands of children's sight. Many people admit they have heard about her after hearing this, but didn't know who she was. This shows how little the British public knows about her and highlights the need to make her achievements better known. Ferry was fortunate to have known Dorothy while she was still alive and had the chance to meet all her close friends and relatives.

Janson's paintings have been collected by museums and private collectors alike. Recently, her work has been exhibited in London and New York. Sarah's fascination with trompe-l'oeil started early in her career when she was an undergraduate. She discovered that by using a particular style, the subject matter was of secondary importance, as she could concentrate on how the painting worked and how to make the illusion work. As a result, she began to explore the medium to its fullest, taking the illusion as far as it would go. Janson is a meticulous and methodical painter. She starts by studying the object she wants to represent in a painting. Her aim is to capture the true essence of the object. Janson believes that the best trompe-l'oeil should look as though it was done badly. This concept was developed by the old masters such as Zeuxis and Andrea Mantegna.

Sarah Janson is a painter that makes things look very real. This type of painting is called ""trompe-l'oeil"", which is French for ""cheat the eye"".

Recently, her work was shown in London and New York.

Sarah's love for this type of painting started when she was a student. What she likes most about it is that she can focus on making the painting work, rather than just on what the painting is of. Because of this, she started to explore all she could do with this kind of painting. Her goal is to make the illusion as good as possible, but it should look like it was done badly.

It shows both the joys and struggles of his life as he manages to go through some good and some bad. The book gives a detailed glimpse into a life and does a good job of showing how people can be different from each other even though we might seem the same. The story was well written, but there were some areas that I felt could have been expanded upon or even completely removed. Some of the characters seemed to be one dimensional and I would have liked to see them have a little bit more depth to them. I didn't feel that the relationship between the two main characters was really believable. The narrator did a good job with the audio book I listened to. He did a really good job of inflecting his voice so that I could tell what each character sounded like. All in all, the story was enjoyable and was worth.

The Career of Citizen Tristan Smith

Once upon a time in a faraway land called Efica, there lived a boy named Tristan Smith. Efica was a special place - it was a utopia. This means that people there were kind and happy. They worked together and helped each other. Efica had its own history, traditions and customs. The author skillfully made this world very real.

When Tristan was six years old, he was sent to a faraway place called the United States. He grew up in an orphanage in Minnesota. He faced many struggles and joys in his life. The book tells his story from when he was born to when he grew up. The book gives a detailed glimpse into Tristan's life, showing us how different people can be even though they may seem the same.

The writing in the book was very good. However, there were some parts that could have been made better. Some of the characters seemed one-dimensional and could have been given more depth. Also, the relationship between Tristan and another character was not very believable.

But the narrator of the audiobook did a wonderful job. He used different tones to make each character's voice unique. Overall, the story was enjoyable and worth listening to. It was good for people who wanted to read an interesting story about the life of a young man in different places. The Autom"

Out of the blue Hakan Hardenberger the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world’s trumpet-players today. Hakan Hardenberger had no special interest in the trumpet when he was young. He also found practicing more fun than taking lessons at the school of music in Gothenburg. He has since then turned it all around. Hakan Hardenberger is not interested in the trumpet of the conventional type at all. The French horn, the violin and the guitar have all been replaced by the trumpet in a series of 20th century premieres. In 1983 Hardenberger made his debut at the New York Philharmonic with a piece composed especially for him by the famous American composer John Adams, called “The Chairman Dances”. This piece was not written for trumpet, but Hardenberger had requested John Adams to write a piece for him. John Adams, the composer of a number of other pieces played by Hardenberger, is well aware of the extraordinary talent of this young musician. For example, he points to an encore at the end of the 1991 concert in New York. “We only had 5 minutes left of playing time, and there was no time for any piece in our concert program. But there’s Hakan on the platform, and within 30 seconds he’s playing Piazzolla, an Argentinean Tango. It was unbelievable and it sounded just marvellous.” To this.

She could not tell why this should be, but the other men she knew seemed to like deceit, they seemed to think that to deceive was part of manhood. Not Charles. Charles, as she had always thought of him, was above such weaknesses. He might tease, he might be mischievous, but deception was not in his character; it was not part of the sort of man he was. [....] He had said it perfectly well: the exact name, as she knew he must. He must know that now it would be most unkind, most unfair to her, if he let her go on thinking that he had not. And why should he do that? What possible pleasure or amusement could he find in the agitation and vexation he was causing her? It was not like Charles. But how to make him say it again? To remind him was to accuse him of forgetting and that seemed so ungracious - and then he might think that she was trying to make him say it when he did not want.

A quarter of a century ago Daniel Goleman set out to answer that question and to show that there are indeed certain kinds of skills that can be learned that will help you to develop your full potential at work. He called these skills 'emotional intelligence'. They include three main areas: - Knowing your own emotions - Managing your emotions - Understanding the emotions of others ### 1. Knowing your own emotions To begin with, you must recognise and understand your feelings so that you can make the most of them. This may seem like a strange notion but emotions can be a tremendous resource. Emotions can guide our actions and help us to make good decisions. Just as an engineer needs to know the properties of steel or a biologist those of the human body so do we need.

Emotional Intelligence: The Secret to Success
Daniel Goleman explores the 'people skills' that are critical for achieving the top spot in your career. The standards for work are changing. We are now being evaluated by a new yardstick -- not just by how smart we are, or our training and skills, but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. These are not qualities we are born with, but skills we can learn and develop. Just like other skills, such as reading or math, they can be taught and practiced. This has implications for all of us. If we don't learn these skills at home or in school, we need to learn them ourselves. Just as knowledge, ability, training, and experience are necessary for excelling in your work, you also need to acquire new knowledge, skills, and habits. The question is: What are these skills?

A quarter of a century ago, Daniel Goleman set out to answer that question and to prove that there are indeed certain types of skills that can be learned to help you reach your full potential at work. He called these skills 'emotional intelligence.' They consist of three main areas:

1. Knowing your own emotions: First and foremost, recognize and understand your feelings so you can make the most of them. This might sound odd, but emotions can be a great resource. Emotions can guide our actions and aid us"

C1,"Given this story: Sound the Alarm Stuart Harris reports Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? A sound alarm is as important as a great cuppa when you wake up. Radio alarm clocks make a great way of starting your day and the choice is vast. Some people like the idea of waking up to your favourite radio station and the choice of stations is usually quite impressive. Others prefer the CD or iPod alarm but don’t forget a clock radio when the power’s out or the iPod fails, you’ll need a radio. When you’re buying a clock radio, consider: 1. Price – You can pick up basic models for as little as 10 but if you want FM with DAB and an iPod dock it can cost up to 100. 2. Size – You’ll want one that fits comfortably on your bedside cabinet. 3. Appearance – The design of the clock is important if you care about aesthetics. 4. Functions – Look for one with an easy-to-read display. 5. Alarm – Some include two or more alarms and a sleep function so you can wake up gradually. 6. Power – Look for one that uses AA batteries as a backup power supply. This can be useful in case of a mains failure or if you’ve forgotten to plug it in. 7. CD/iPod dock – This should be compatible with most players and some models allow you to charge your device as well. 8..

Danny Danziger: Seeing Green: The Politics of Ecology is your latest book and is a powerful book on ecology, politics and power. Can you give us a summary of what it's about? Jonathon Porritt: I would not want to presume to give you a summary - I hope you will read the book yourself! But I can say that it was written in two parts, the first of which is about the state of the world today and why the world is in so much trouble. So it’s about energy, food, water, forests, climate change, population growth, human rights and the need for a new kind of economics. The second part is about the transformations that we need to bring about to create a sustainable society. It’s a practical work that spells out what we can do to change the world, beginning with the idea that we all need to rethink what development really means, the concept of global citizenship and the need for a global transformation in power and resources.

He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard.

The depiction of the relationship between uncle and niece is compelling, and the young protagonist’s growing awareness of her predicament adds a layer of excitement to the book. Overall, this is a captivating mystery which will satisfy readers who enjoy unpredictable and tense narratives. Highly recommended.

In the summer, we’ve a good many foxes on the farm and often get people handing in orphaned cubs. However, it’s quite rare to get any other types of wildlife. ‘Baby badgers?’ I asked the lady. ‘It’s my husband’s fox hunts and they came across the litter of badger cubs on the moors near us,’ she told me. ‘He was about to shoot the badgers, but they were so cute that he brought them to me and now I’m here at the farm with them.’ She then passed me over a box containing the two tiny badgers. I couldn’t believe my eyes – they were so adorable, and I fell head over heels in love with them straight away. The cubs were only a few days old, but I could see they were extremely healthy. ‘Where are their mother and siblings?’ I asked. ‘I don’t know’, said the lady. I looked down and noticed that one of the cubs had the same tattoo on its ear as the other. ‘Is that a farm tattoo?’ I asked. ‘Yes, it’s ours,’ she said with pride. ‘We must have found the same mother and her.

A few years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our farm in Somerset into an 'open farm.' Since then, we've become known for taking care of orphaned animals. One day, a lady came to our farm with her two children and two baby badgers. She told us the cubs were found on the moors near her home by her husband and his friends, who go hunting. At first, they were going to shoot the badgers, but they changed their minds when they saw how cute they were. The lady brought the badgers to our farm because she knew we would look after them.

The badgers were tiny, only a few days old. They were so cute and healthy-looking that I instantly loved them. I asked the lady where the mom and the rest of the litter were, but she didn't know. What was strange was that one of the cubs had a tattoo with the same number as the one on my farm. The lady told me that the badgers had found the same mom and her litter.

The lady left our farm with her two children, and I was left with the two cute badger cubs. They had a lot of people watching over them, and they were well taken care of. It was a good day at our open farm.

C1,"Given this story: DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. A A book is a big investment, and a good review helps sell it. Our marketing departments want reviews and are constantly hunting for them. However, a bad review - or too many of them - can also be off-putting, even if it doesn't necessarily mean fewer copies sold. Publisher B At an advertising level, yes, they are important. They tell the reader what is hot and what is not. If a book is given a lot of space in the media, people take notice of it. A bad review can kill a book's sales, while a good one can boost them. Publisher C Yes, in as far as the public wants reassurance from the media. The media's view carries a lot of weight. A review isn't always an endorsement of the book, though. Some books may be criticised but still sell because the public read them. Publisher D Reviews are important in that they give a credibility to a book - it lends authority and weight. They may not have much of an impact on first sales, but, in the long term, they help keep a book in print. Publisher E Reviews matter, but, like so many things, they are not the be-all and end-all. The public may prefer to make up their own minds after reading the book, and good word of mouth is worth ten reviews. Reviews will sell a book, but ultimately the book has to stand on its own.

DO REVIEWS HELP SELL BOOKS?

We asked five famous publishers about the effect of book reviews on a book's success. This is what they said. 

Publisher A
Reviews are really important. They're the first thing you look at in a newspaper. A good review can help sell a book, but a bad one might put people off. 

Publisher B
Reviews can be very helpful when selling books. They let people know which books are popular. A bad review can stop a book from selling well, but a good one can boost sales.

Publisher C
Yes, reviews help sell books. People like to get advice from the media. However, sometimes people read books even if they get criticism.

Publisher D

C1,"Given this story: WEATHERVANE MAKER THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham’s designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. Graham and his wife live on the North Lincolnshire coast, where he has been making weathervanes for the past 15 years. Many customers ask Graham to incorporate particular details such as the emblem of a motorbike to celebrate a birthday, the initials of the couple celebrating their Golden Wedding, or the shape of a ship to represent a lifelong ambition. For other customers, it’s the plain elegance and simplicity of the weathervane that they appreciate. All materials are supplied to the customer, who can specify whether the weathervane is for indoors or outdoors, and in which colours the different elements of the design will be. Graham advises, but the customer has the final decision. The weathervane is crafted on mild steel to keep the weight down, and is made in three pieces so that when the time comes to erect it, all the customer has to do is to take the pieces out of their box, fasten them together, and put it into the post provided. The customer is then free to paint it in whatever colours they choose and, if required, have the name of their property gilded on it. A weathervane’s life is long, and when a customer tells Graham, ‘They’ve had it for 30 years’, he is glad to have done his job well. For many.

Graham Smith is a weathervane maker. He works from a workshop in North Lincolnshire. Weathervanes are metal objects that help people know which way the wind is blowing. Making weathervanes is a very old skill, going back to ancient Egypt. 

Graham makes weathervanes by hand. He cuts them out of a metal called mild steel. This keeps them light, so they are easy to move. 

Most weathervanes are simple. But sometimes people ask Graham to add extra details. These might include the letters of a special event or a symbol like a ship.

When someone wants a weathervane, Graham gives them some advice. But the customer gets to decide the colours and details of their weathervane. The weathervanes come in three pieces. The customer can put them together, then paint them.

Graham enjoys making weathervanes because they last a long time. He is happy if someone tells him their weathervane has lasted 30 years. This shows that his work is good. 

Graham's work is still popular today. Even though many weathervanes are simple, they show how old and important this craft is. Graham continues to make weathervanes for his customers. He follows a tradition that began over 4000 years ago in Egypt.

Of course, your schedule and personal taste will dictate the ideal time for you, but here's why that's the most favorable period for most people. You're Winding Down The most important thing to consider when planning when to smoke cannabis is your current state of mind and energy levels. At the end of a long day, your energy is likely depleted, and you're probably looking to relax, slow down, and wind down. The end of the day and evening is typically the perfect time to smoke cannabis. Sleep One of the most popular reasons that people turn to cannabis use is to help them get a good night's sleep, or to relax during the day for that reason. It helps to calm.

Ten miles south of the equator a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. Nerurkar is here on a self-imposed training mission, determined to learn how his Kenyan counterparts prepare for the Olympic trials in his quest to qualify for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. His long limbs shuffle up the rocky path, his bare brown feet slipping on the loose scree of volcanic ash, as he tries to find a path through the long grass. It has been a long journey for Nerurkar, 27, one of Britain's top 10,000 metre runners, who has been training with some of Kenya's leading athletes at a high altitude training camp. 'The altitude is hard at first, ' says Nerurkar, 'but I get used to it quite quickly. 'The training here is much harder than I do back in England,' he says. 'But I'm not doing it for the easy life, and I think it's the type of training that will get me where I need to be.'

C1,"Given this story: THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should combine old and new says Tom Cunliffe. And he put it into practice in his own craft 'The Westerman'. This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. Tom Cunliffe The Sunday Times, Boating Magazine 18 July 2004 I AM always on the lookout for an alternative to a standard hull form. I like my boats to have a distinctive shape that sets them apart, but which still performs well. My latest acquisition, The Westerman, was designed by a young, talented sailor called Ed Burnett, who happens to be my son, and features all the modern amenities you could wish for. Having lived with the hull shape for almost a year, I believe it strikes a balance between old and new, combining the traditional and modern in one package. The Westerman is built of composite materials to keep weight down, and it has a long keel, but it has a large rudder to help steer her in a crosswind when on a reach. She is designed to be fast, yet able to get herself out of trouble when the weather takes a turn for the worse. Apart from the large wheel-shaped steering gear, she has three large wheel-shaped lockers in the cockpit to stow all the necessary gear. There is also a good-sized double aft cabin in which one can get into a comfy bunk and get a good night’s sleep. I have also managed to fit her out with a large, square cockpit table that sits perfectly over.

The boat of My Dreams
The best boat design should mix old and new designs, says Tom Cunliffe. He followed his own advice and built a boat with those features. This boat is called The Westerman. There is a large boat show going on in London right now. You will see many fine yachts at the show. The yachts have many high-tech features, like lots of electronic tools. These yachts are the children of the hull-shape revolution. That means the yachts are better than the boats built before 25 years ago. Tom Cunliffe is a famous boat writer. He likes the boat he built. The boat has new features, but still looks like an old boat. The boat is made of lightweight materials. It has a long, heavy part at the bottom, which is useful in rough weather. The boat can move fast and has a large wheel that can help steer it during a strong wind. The boat also has three big storage spaces to keep all the stuff you need. There is also a comfortable sleeping space, for a peaceful night's sleep. Tom managed to fit a large, square table into the boat. The table is a great place to sit and eat. 

The boat of my dreams should blend modern and old designs. So I built one, and it’s called “The Westerman”. The hull shape is from a young"

The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards.  They usually have five toes on the front paws and four toes on the back paws. The five-toed hedgehog, or atelerix, is found in Morocco and Algeria, while the four-toed hedgehog, or pentatrichus, is found in Southern Europe and Asia. There are 16 species of hedgehog in the world, including 7 European species, 4 African species, 4 Asiatic or Middle Eastern species, and one that lives in the Middle East and India. Hedgehogs are nocturnal mammals and are mostly found in meadows and woodlands where they live underground and eat insects, small reptiles and sometimes eggs. A hedgehog's diet consists of invertebrates, small mammals, and fruits and vegetables. Hedgehogs use their sharp spines to protect themselves from predators. Their teeth are too small for them to eat large quantities of meat, so they are mainly insectivores. Some species of hedgehogs are solitary while others are social and live in groups. Hedgehogs live between two and seven years. They can also roll themselves into a tight ball when they feel threatened or scared, so that their spines are pointing outwards, this is their defence mechanism. The female hedgehogs have one or two litters per year, the young are.

C1,"Given this story: Blacksmiths THROUGHOUT the ages iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers because they were the sole providers of weapons armour and farming tools. The work done by these blacksmiths required considerable knowledge and skill. They first heated the iron in a furnace to 1800 centigrade to turn it into a malleable and pliable mass called a bloom. Then they used a hot chisel called a sledge to hammer the bloom into a bar of iron with a cross-section resembling a large letter `H’ . This was done to remove the carbon and other impurities from the iron so that it could be fashioned into the desired shapes. The bloom was placed on an anvil and its cross-bar was forged into the shape of the finished article.  The bloom was placed on an anvil and its cross-bar was forged into the shape of the finished article. This work required great physical stamina. The blacksmiths worked in an uncomfortable environment. Blacksmiths had to perform most of their work while standing up. As a result of this arduous work many of the blacksmiths were said to have developed bent bodies and twisted hands. After it left the blacksmith’s forge the finished product was quenched in a container of water or oil to harden the iron before it cooled. The blacksmiths also had a large assortment of tongs hammers anvils and other tools in addition to their fireproof aprons. They knew how to use them all with.

This is the story about blacksmiths. From the beginning of time, they have been able to create amazing things from iron. Before there were big factories, these people were very special. They were as important as doctors and people who read the stars. They did many things that people still admire today. The process was very difficult. First, they would heat the iron to a very high temperature, around 1800 degrees. This made the iron soft so it could be shaped easily. Then they used a tool like a hammer to make the iron into a long, H-shaped piece. This helped them remove bad stuff inside the iron. After that, they would beat the iron on the anvil, an iron block. This made their finished product. It took a lot of strength and effort, and the blacksmiths often felt tired and sore. They used lots of tools, like hammers, and special gloves to protect them from the heat. After they finished making something, they would put it in a bucket of water or oil. This helped harden the metal. So, blacksmiths were very important long ago. They made things that people still use and admire today. Their work was hard but they used great skills to make amazing items. They were very special people. And that's the story of blacksmiths.

Sir Edmund Halley tried to find Earth's true north. The astronomer was the first person to calculate that comet's period - the time it took to travel around the Sun. It takes about 75 years for the comet to go around the Sun once. Halley's comet last appeared in 1986, and won't come around again until 2061.

In the end, Toby Clark found that Sir Edmund Halley was a very important man. He helped create some of the first maps of true north and compass variation. These maps have been used for hundreds of years to find your way. By doing this, he made a big difference to people's lives. His maps helped explorers, sailors and scientists.

In 1975, at the age of 23, Doug Scott climbed his first great mountain: Mount Everest in Nepal. Later, he climbed Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia. Doug was a true mountaineer. He loved the challenge and the excitement of climbing huge mountains.

Scott wasn't just climbing mountains for fun; he was on a mission. His goal was to become one of the few people in the world who had climbed the highest peaks on every continent. This goal was called ""The Seven Summits"". 

To achieve this goal, Scott had to conquer seven mountains on different continents: 
1. Mount Everest on Asia
2. Carstensz Pyramid on Australia
3. Denali in North America
4. Aconcagua in South America
5. Kilimanjaro in Africa
6. Mount Elbrus in Europe
7. Vinson Massif in Antarctica.

It took Scott many years to complete his challenge. During this time, he overcame many obstacles, like severe weather and physical exhaustion. But, he never gave up. 

When he finally reached the top of the last mountain, Vinson Massif, in 2003, Scott became part of an elite group of climbers who had achieved the ""Seven Summits"" goal. This achievement made"

Apart from the technical and artistic considerations the photographer has to be conscious of actions gestures and expressions. Photographing a group in a group portrait requires not only attention to all of the details mentioned for a single person shot but it also requires that the photographer pay attention to the relative position of the figures in the group. A good group portrait should show the group as a whole and not as a collection of individuals. There is an old saying among photographers: ‘Photography is 90% of the picture.’ It has become a cliche because it is so true. Getting good pictures starts with having your equipment and yourself in the right place at the right time. It’s the rest that’s the tough part. Having the right equipment: Digital Cameras The only must have is an automatic exposure mode: aperture or shutter priority; auto or programmed auto. You might want some control over exposure. The ability to get more depth of field and lower noise at higher ISOs is a good consideration.

Photography and People

One of the most interesting things in photography is people. A photo with someone in it often seems more exciting than the same photo without a person. However, taking a good photo of a person is not easy. There are many details you need to think about such as lighting and focus.

Taking a photograph of a group of people can be even more challenging. Besides the factors above, you need to pay attention to the positions of the individuals in the group. A good group photo should represent everyone as a part of a whole rather than just separate people.

There is a common saying among photographers: ‘Photography is 90% of the picture.’ This saying is often used because it is true. The most important part of taking a good photo is being in the right place at the right time. The technical and artistic details are the challenging part.

Using the Right Tools

Taking good photos starts with having the right equipment. You need to have an automatic mode on your camera, such as aperture or shutter priority. These modes allow you to have more control over the exposure. You might also want to consider a camera that can capture more depth of field and has lower noise at higher ISOs.

In summary, taking great photos of people is difficult but very rewarding. The key is to be in the right place at the right time and understand the technical and artistic aspects of"

""We’re looking for the best – and the worst – in the world of hospitality,"" she says, her voice as calm as a well-appointed hotel room. ""We’re looking for hotels with a story to tell."" In the early days, when she was a trainee in the NHS in the 1980s, Brown – now the ""face of the Hotel Inspector franchise"" – worked as a maternity assistant, helping first-time mothers in labour. Her first ever patient was a woman who had a normal, if stressful, pregnancy. But her second patient was having twins and went into labour prematurely, at a mere 25 weeks. ""We had to deliver them that night. We saved both their lives. It was one of those defining moments."" There followed a career in nursing that included looking after the newly opened ward at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. In 1996, Brown moved into private healthcare and started advising hotels, spas and health clubs on how to improve. Today, as an agent for the Hotel Inspector, Brown, who studied medicine in Bristol and worked in NHS administration before going private, spends much of her time at hotels around the world, watching the owners and their staffs deal with a host of minor and major cr.

C1,"Given this story: The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support If you applied for a job in some countries you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting as much as anything else that would determine your suitability for the job. Saturday, 10th December 2011 by the British Medical Journal BMJ 343 doi: http://www.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/bmj.d7555 (Published 29 November 2011) (Pre-publication version) Do you think handwriting analysis is “New age” pseudoscience? You should be impressed by the findings of this review of a sample of the world’s handwriting. It is, of course, entirely possible that the people with such fine handwriting also tend to live their lives in a neat and orderly manner, but the association could also be due to a third factor, such as genes. Or perhaps there is something in the handwriting per se. Whatever the explanation, the association is so strong that handwriting must be doing something to the person who writes it. This is an unusual piece of work by a group of psychologists: to attempt to establish whether there is a causal link between handwriting and the character of the writer. The best that most psychologists can manage is to show that there is a strong association. The rest is just conjecture. The fact that the British Medical Journal is publishing this piece, which is a review of research by a group of psychologists, indicates that there is growing support for the notion that there might be something in handwriting that.

The study of handwriting to find out what kind of person someone is is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you want to get a job you would most likely need to show your writing style. They would look at the way you write to decide if you are right for the job or not. This was written by the British Medical Journal on December 10th, 2011. Does handwriting analysis seem like some kind of new age, made-up science to you? You should be impressed by how these researchers studied handwriting from a big group of people. It is possible that those who have neat handwriting just live neat lives, too, but there could also be another reason. Maybe it's the handwriting itself that influences the person who writes it. Whatever it is, the connection is strong. It is not common for psychologists to show this kind of link, but they did in this case. The British Medical Journal's decision to publish this piece of research proves there is more and more support for the idea that handwriting might tell us something about the writer's character.

The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The collection has the aim to give an overview of the evolution of Classical Art from the seventh century BC to the fifth century AD. To understand the history of the casts, it is necessary to know who brought them. Two artists, Robert E. Chapman and Sir Henry Woodfield, were given the task of cast the sculptures from the originals. Chapman, an American, travelled to Europe to make casts of the antique sculptures. Woodfield was given the task of copying the copies that Chapman had already made, which he did, with additions of new pieces whenever a new original was found. The first cast that was displayed in University College London was in 1884. Since then, the University of London has acquired most of the collection as one of the most important art galleries in the world. In 1932 the University of London opened the Museum of Classical Archaeology. This museum now has over 600 pieces and houses many important works.

C1,"Given this story: Are you too nice for your own good? When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity. 'I'm so sorry' I beamed when I dropped the plate on the floor and it smashed into smithereens.  I would apologise to my manager for being late even though it was not my fault that the traffic had caused me to be late. ""I'm so sorry,"" I'd babble, my face flushed with embarrassment. I also remember apologising to the chef when he threw a metal tray that ricocheted off the wall, causing a dent in it. ""I'm so sorry,"" I stuttered nervously. Every time, the same reply would come. ""Don't be sorry,"" he'd bark, his face a picture of annoyance. ""That was your job not yours and you need to get tougher skin than that"". As a waitress and later as a manager in the service industry, saying sorry was part of my job, a way to maintain good customer relations. But how much saying sorry can impact one’s professional success? Many people believe that being too nice can hold you back. A new book titled Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office, by Lois P. Frankel, suggests that women who are too nice can be seen as indecisive, indepensive and lacking in confidence. The book argues that the behaviour that men are allowed to display is often seen as confident leadership when women display the same behaviour it is seen as being pushy. In one study by the Harvard Business School, female students.

When I dropped a plate and broke it, I would smile and say, ""I'm so sorry."" If my boss was late because of traffic, I would still say, ""I'm so sorry."" I remember even apologizing to a chef when he accidentally threw a tray and it left a dent in the wall. ""I'm so sorry,"" I kept saying. But the boss would tell me not to say sorry because it was part of my job and I needed to be tougher. So, being nice all the time can sometimes hold you back in life and work. A book called ""Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office"" says that being too nice can make you seem weak and indecisive. Men can be confident leaders, but when women do the same thing, people call them pushy. A study from the Harvard Business School showed that female students were seen as too emotional, so they might not get the same chances as men. So, being overly nice all the time might not be the best way to be successful in work. Just being sweet and kind all the time may not always be the right way to be successful in life.

And the scientists, university students and teachers in the seats were wearing specialised overalls and helmets. In a few seconds time they would be subjected to conditions of near zero gravity thanks to an unusual manoeuvre, the aircraft would begin to dive nose down, rapidly pulling up to reduce its air speed to near the speed of sound. Once there, it would stay there for a few seconds, before beginning the descent back to Seattle. The students had been given the opportunity to try out their ideas in these conditions. A young girl had a problem with the packaging of sanitary pads that she couldn’t solve on earth, but thought she could solve in the weightlessness of the near-space environment. Others were more conventional, for example, looking for the best way to grow plants on Mars, or testing a new type of medicine that had been made from a new method of combining ingredients. There were lots of experiments underway on board, but as a journalist it is difficult to report them, because they are a trade secret.

Richard Cork tells a story about the day he saw one of the most famous artists of the 20th century. Cork was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe before going to university. 

Picasso was easily recognizable. He was eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour.  

Picasso would have been 110 years old now. Over the years, there has been some controversy about his art, relationships with other artists and with women, and his position in the history of 20th-century art. Cork said, ""Picasso was more or less the starting point of modern art."" 

At the time, Picasso was a ""towering figure"". He was the most famous artist in the world. He really changed what it meant to be an artist.

C1,"Given this story: Hit and miss of mass marketing AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.  When mass marketing became feasible in the 1920s, it was the perfect solution to the problem of selling products on a large scale. Advertising worked by creating enormous markets out of the population as a whole. But the old mass marketing equation, which has served so well for so long, is not sustainable. The consumer is no longer a passive receptacle to be inundated with advertising. Instead, the consumer is a more sophisticated and independent-minded person who wants to make up his or her own mind. And we are fast becoming so skilled at avoiding advertising that the whole business of interrupting people to try and persuade them of the merits of our products is beginning to seem counterproductive. It is no wonder, then, that the advertising world has come to feel under siege. We are desperately trying to re-engineer the advertising message and the way it is delivered to make it more effective. There is also growing evidence that we are changing the way we behave in our personal lives. This change has been brought about by economic necessity and technological convenience. More of us than ever before are having to fend for ourselves. More of us than ever before are having to fend for ourselves. Our homes have become mini supermarkets.

Advertising has been struggling and many people know this. It's not just because of the recession. Advertising began to lose its effectiveness in 1989, well before the recession started. Advertising's main problem is that it hasn't kept up with the changing economy.

When mass marketing started in the 1920s, it was perfect for selling to large groups of people. Advertising worked by creating large markets from the whole population. However, the old way of mass marketing doesn't work anymore. People are no longer just passive receivers of advertising messages. Instead, they've become more independent and sophisticated. They want to make up their own minds about what to buy.

As a result, advertising feels like it's under siege. The industry is desperately trying to change the way messages are delivered and how they are made more effective. There's also increasing evidence that people are changing the way they behave in their personal lives. This change is a result of economic necessity and technological convenience. Many people now shop around for the best value or the latest deal, and they are more concerned with quality. And they are better at finding value for their money.

C1,"Given this story: POWER DRESSING EVERY SUMMER the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance?  Whipsnade, where I am heading this summer, has a population of 1,300 peacocks. It is not the largest of them but it is one of the best for peacocking, as we call the process of showing off. As I walk around the park, admiring not only the peacocks but also the animals inside it, I become aware that something is missing - the noise of children. In summer Whipsnade often has 300,000 visitors, most of whom bring their kids to see the many big animals there, such as the new-born African elephants, but on this day the park is deserted. Whipsnade, the largest wildlife park in the UK, has a magnificent collection of animals including rhinos, giraffes, zebras, lions and tigers but many have only recently been transplanted from London Zoo - the largest privately funded zoo in Europe and only a few hours away. The animals in the London Zoo are better cared for than those in any other zoo I have ever visited - or even in some private game parks. They are given the most up-to-date treatments when they are sick, fed the best food and have the best veterinarians and nutritionists on hand. As we drive back to London, the animals of Whipsnade and London zoos stay on.

Every summer, peacocks at a wildlife park in England display their beautiful tail feathers. These birds show off to the other birds, and their feathers are very striking. The peacocks are a mystery to people, like they were to Charles Darwin, a famous scientist. He couldn't understand how birds could have such fancy feathers when nature is so tough.

The park, called Whipsnade Wild Animal Park, is usually very busy with visitors and children. But on the day the story takes place, there are hardly any people. This is a rare opportunity to enjoy the animals and birds in peace. The park has around 1,300 peacocks, making it a good place for peacock-watching. 

In summer, the park usually has many visitors, including families who come to see the new baby elephants and other animals. But on this day, the park is empty. Whipsnade has lots of different animals, like rhinos, giraffes, zebras, lions, and tigers. These animals were moved from another zoo in London. 

The animals at the London zoo get good care, food, and medicine. They have excellent vets and nutritionists. As the people drive back to the city, they think about the animals they saw and how happy they were to see them in peace.

C1,"Given this story: NATURAL TALENTS In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees we haven’t had time to develop any differences: genetically we’re still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps. On this grand evolutionary scale whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. Julian Simpson I WOULD like to thank the organisers for giving me the honour of speaking tonight, and the audience for their patience in waiting for me to get here. I’ve been asked to address the topic of humanity’s relationship with the other animals that share our planet. The first thing I want to do is dispel any ideas that we have some kind of ‘in-built’ superiority over all other creatures. You see, in the grand scheme of evolutionary things, we human beings are barely different from the animals.  We’re very recent arrivals on the Earth, having separated from the apes, with whom we are most closely related, just a mere seven million years ago. You could even say that we’re the ‘red-headed step children’ of the animal kingdom – not that we’re red-headed, of course, but it’s an amusing image to consider.  And the fact is, when you compare our basic anatomy to that of the other great apes, the resemblance is remarkable: our spines, our skeletons, the structure of our bones, even the structure of our very cells – it’s not until you get to the genes that we diverge significantly. In fact, the genetic differences between chimps, gorillas, and ourselves are no greater than the genetic differences between individual humans.

Once we humans and chimps separated about seven million years ago, we didn't change a lot: Genetically, we were more than 98 percent the same. When comparing our basic anatomy with the other great apes, we look very similar. It isn't until we compare our genes that we find significant differences. So, remember, we're not much different from animals in the big picture. We are very recent arrivals on Earth, and we're closely related to the apes. In fact, the genetic differences between chimps, gorillas, and humans are similar to the differences among individual humans. Let's put aside the idea that we're genetically superior to other animals, since we're quite similar to them. This speech aims to clarify the relationship between humans and other animals that share our planet. Let's remember that in the grand scheme of evolution, we're only slightly different from them. In summary, our relationship with other animals requires respect and understanding because we are, in many ways, quite similar to them. We owe it to them and to ourselves to treat them with kindness and care. That's why understanding our relationship with the other animals is so important. Remember, we're all part of the same family on this beautiful planet. So, let's respect and cherish the bond we share with all living beings. The world needs it more than ever. The"

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.  23 June 1992, Wednesday It's a classic story of capitalism, with a hint of cultural imperialism to spice it up. Once an exotic novelty, chewing gum is now a cornerstone of modern life. Today there are 12 million sticks of it being chomped every day in the USA and, in the developing world too, the ubiquitous chewing gum – from the top-selling Wrigley's Spearmint to humble bubble gum – has become a cultural staple and an economic powerhouse. The story begins with the Aztecs. When Spanish soldiers arrived in Mexico 400 years ago, they found natives chewing a mixture of chicle (the sap of the sapodilla tree), spices and water. But it took the ingenuity of an American dentist in the late 19th century to develop the first commercially manufactured chewing gum, and by the 1920s it was being marketed in Britain as a harmless and refreshing ""breath mint"". Nowadays, Americans consume as many as 12 million sticks of gum a day – more if you take into account chewing tobacco – with a market worth $7bn (£5bn). The UK gum market, in contrast, is worth about £264m, with 45.

Chewing gum has become part of our daily lives. We now chew it millions of times a day. A long time ago, people in Mexico used to chew a special mix made of tree sap, water, and spices. Then in the late 1800s, an American dentist developed the first commercial chewing gum. Today, around 12 million Americans chew it every day. Chewing gum is now popular all around the world. Even people in poor countries now enjoy it. Many chewing gums are good for your teeth. The UK's gum market is much smaller than the US's at $264 million compared to the US's $7 billion. 

Chewing gum is a part of modern culture. It is now an economic powerhouse. It has become an integral part of our daily lives. Even people in developing countries now enjoy this treat. Many types of chewing gums are good for teeth. The gum market in the UK is not as big as in the US. The US's gum market is worth $7 billion, while the UK's is just $264 million. So, chewing gum is a large industry. It is very important to the economy. Gum has become a part of everyday life. The popularity of chewing gum continues to grow. This shows the influence of cultural imperialism.

'A Tamburlaine the Great'

Marilowe's ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending, but it becomes one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands' staging. He has cut a lot from the original text and offers a production that combines the high points of Marilowe's play with an exciting speed and energy.

Tamburlaine is one of the most fearsome characters in literature, a ruthless and ambitious warrior with a heart full of evil. Yet he has a magnetism that attracts others to join him in his bloodthirsty, genocidal conquests. He has a plan to rule the world, and no one is going to stop him.

All of this is wonderfully realized by Michael Braden's excellent performance as the main character, Tamburlaine. He is dangerously physical and powerful, a man who can be a killer but also inspire others with his incredible charisma.

At first, the play takes some time to set up the stakes of power and land, but once it gets started, it is a breath-taking, exciting event. There are moments when you feel a chill run down your spine, and you know that you're experiencing something special.

If that’s not enough there is a biomass boiler for backup.’  Mr Lancaster is a local builder, so he and his wife, Julia, who works in the local authority as an environmental health officer, were in a good position to plan their house from the start, but the principles applied are those which any homeowner can follow.  The house has been built in the middle of a courtyard to benefit from the sun’s heat during the winter. ‘The most efficient way of heating a house is to get the most sun you can,’ said Mr Lancaster. The house also has a very good thermal design, with thick walls and high levels of insulation. And, of course, it is designed to be very airtight.  The Lancasters also plan to have their house in their retirement, so it’s built to last with traditional materials. However,.

C1,"Given this story: Ancient Chinese medicine in the West? Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism massage diet manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions but acupuncture’s role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. Acupuncture Acupuncture has evolved from the traditional practice of using animal bones and shells to stimulate acupoints on the body to the current method of using stainless steel needles. This form of “medicine” works on the belief that an imbalance of energy or Qi causes illness and that the needles restore the balance by influencing the flow of Qi along specific pathways known as meridians in the body. Acupuncture’s effect on pain is most commonly explained by the gate control theory which suggests that acupuncture needle stimulation activates nerve cells in the spinal cord that inhibit the conduction of pain signals in the brain. Acupuncture has a wide range of applications and its use has expanded rapidly in the Western world. It is reported that approximately 10 million Americans have now used acupuncture, with thousands of doctors trained in this technique. Acupuncture’s role in treating pain Acupuncture is often effective in relieving pain by stimulating the body’s own endorphins. This is particularly effective for chronic back pain, osteoarthritis, knee pain and neck pain. It is also used in the treatment of migraines, dental pain, temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ syndrome) and other pains not derived from injury. In addition, acupuncture has been.

Output the generated story directly. A long time ago, in China, there was a way of treating different illnesses using things such as herbs, exercise and massage. One part of this system was acupuncture. It is more than 2000 years old. Over time, acupuncture has changed from using animal bones and shells to stimulate the body, to using steel needles instead. Acupuncture works by balancing the body’s energy, which is called Qi, along specific paths or meridians. This helps stop pain. Doctors in the West, or Europe and America, have taken interest in acupuncture, especially for treating pain, and it is becoming more and more popular. In fact, around 10 million Americans have now used it, and many doctors over there have been trained to do it. It is effective for relieving pain caused by backache, arthritis, knee pain, neck pain, migraines, dental pain, TMJ syndrome and other sources. Basically, it works by causing the body to release its natural painkillers, or endorphins. So, acupuncture has become a common method used for treating pain nowadays.

Inside there were pictures of him playing with a dog (borrowed from Rodney) standing proudly in empty courtrooms washing his new Porsche and standing on board his new boat in the Bahamas. CAPITOL MAGAZINE, DECEMBER 2012. Clay Carter became the youngest U.S. Attorney in history, and the first openly gay U.S. Attorney appointed. He was considered a rising star at the Department of Justice. He was groomed to be President Obama’s nominee for Attorney General. He turned down invitations to the White House to discuss the position. And just when it looked as though he would be handed the highest law enforcement post in the land, he walked away from it all. But his world changed overnight when a body was found in a Texas field—nude, stabbed, and burned. The victim bore a striking resemblance to Clay, and the crime scene mimicked his past. Police suspected Clay was responsible, and he became the prime suspect in a murder investigation. Suddenly, the man who had everything to live for finds himself trying to prove his innocence, as well as the lives of those he loves. As he digs into the case, he uncovers a trail that leads to the darkest corners of his own past, and a secret that could be his most dangerous enemy yet.

Have you ever gone into a store and left with more than you planned to buy? There are many tricks that stores use to make you spend more money than you planned to. Let's take a look at some of these techniques. 

Firstly, stores often use an image of freshness. Supermarkets, for example, know that shoppers really want to see fresh fruits and vegetables on display. This is something they learned from their market research. 

Another technique used by stores is the power of three. It has been found through experiments that when there are three items on offer, people find them more appealing than if there were only two or four. 

Stores also make use of subliminal signals. This means they use very small changes, like altering the color of a sign, to make you think something is on sale even if it isn't. A sign that says '£10' in green might seem like a bargain, while the same sign in red would make it look expensive. 

Free samples are another tool used by stores to make you spend more money. It's hard to resist trying a little taste of something when it's right in front of you. Even better, some stores give out free products to try. 

Lastly, one of the most effective methods stores use to get you to spend more is labelling something as a limited edition. When you"

C1,"Given this story: Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep.  1) The Restoration Theory This theory is perhaps the most popular and most widely believed. This theory is based on the belief that sleep is for the body's physical restoration. During sleep, our body cells renew and repair themselves, tissues and muscles recover from exertion and fatigue, and energy is restored. Furthermore, sleep also serves to clear the brain of the 'junk' information and waste matter that has accumulated in the brain throughout the day, making room for new knowledge and memory. 2) The Hibernation Theory This theory proposes that sleep is for our survival. This theory compares sleep with hibernation in animals such as bears. Animals hibernate to conserve energy during the times when food is scarce. In the same way, humans go into a state of 'pseudo-hibernation' in order to conserve the energy that is used up so unceasingly during waking hours. However, some critics argue that this theory is not applicable to all situations, e.g. tropical places where energy resources are never scarce. 3) The Brain Consolidation Theory This theory suggests that sleep helps consolidate or 'fix' the information in our brain. This theory stems from many scientific studies that found sleep to have a crucial role in learning and memory. Many researchers believe that during sleep the brain is actively processing information, strengthening connections between.

Sleep is a big part of our lives. We spend a third of our lives asleep, so there must be an important reason. Different theories try to explain why we sleep. 

1) Restoration Theory. This is the most popular theory. It says that sleep helps our body rest and recover. While we sleep, our body cells renew themselves and our muscles get back their energy. Our brain also gets rid of old information, making room for new things. 

2) Hibernation Theory. This theory says that sleep helps us save energy. It is like some animals that go into a deep sleep, or ""hibernate"", when they don't have enough food. However, some people think this theory doesn't explain everything about sleep. 

3) Brain Consolidation Theory. This theory says that sleep is important for learning and remembering things. Scientists believe that when we sleep, our brain works to strengthen our memories. 

These theories try to explain why we need sleep. But, we still don't know the exact reason.

We went to four contrasting offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist who studies people’s working conditions; and an occupational psychologist.  Our first office had no natural light, no air, and everyone was hunched over their desks for hours. It was clear that this office had not been designed to be a healthy and happy environment to work in. The psychologist on the panel gave a score of only 3 out of 10. Our building health consultant noted that the indoor air quality was bad, because of the lack of fresh air, and poor ventilation system. The ergonomist then took a look at the seating in the office. She found that most of the chairs were not good for posture, and that the workers were likely to develop problems with their backs and necks. We then moved on to the second office, which was well-lit, with plenty of windows, and had a ventilation system that was working properly. The ergonomist pointed out that the chairs were very good, with adjustable heights and backs that would help maintain good posture. The psychologist gave the office a score of 9 out of 10. They had break out areas for relaxation and there were plants in the office, which made the environment seem more natural and calming. Next, we went to the third office, which was a large call centre with rows of cubicles. The psychologist noted that the workers had little room to move, which can cause stress and high levels of anxiety. The lighting was poor, and.

Is your office working well? Fresh air and the right chairs are very important for a happy, healthy workforce, according to a recent survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. We had three experts with us.

At the first office, there was no natural light, no fresh air, and people stayed hunched over their desks for hours. The psychologist gave it a score of 3 out of 10. The building health consultant said the air quality was bad because there was no fresh air and the ventilation was poor. The ergonomist found the chairs didn't support good posture and workers could get back or neck problems.

We went to the second office, which had plenty of windows, good air, and nice chairs. The psychologist gave it a 9 out of 10. The office had areas for relaxation and plants, making it feel more natural and calm.

Finally, we visited a call centre. The psychologist said the lack of space and poor lighting could cause stress.

C2,"Given this story: Writing by hand and on screen Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over.  Today we live in a world where everyone feels that they have the right to write, and where the proliferation of the internet has produced an endless supply of writers. And yet reading is more important than ever, and it continues to flourish. So, what separates good writing from bad? Why do we need to be able to read so much and so well? Firstly, good writing requires more than just knowledge; it requires the ability to construct a sentence that reads well. We know when we’re reading something that is not well constructed, because it’s hard to read. When a sentence is clear, it’s easy to read. The craft of writing, therefore, is learning to make sentences easier to read. Good writing, in the long run, also requires that it tells a story. Storytelling is an essential part of good writing, and for this reason it is essential that we learn to tell stories as well. Storytelling is not just about telling stories but also about telling stories in a way that can be read and understood by the reader. This is why it is important to be able to read well. Secondly, good writing also requires the ability to convey information effectively. This is important because good writing is not just about telling a story, but also about conveying information effectively. This is what separates good writing from bad writing. Good writing is not just about telling a story,.

The ability to write well is important in many areas of life. Good writing helps us express our thoughts clearly and allows others to understand us easily. We often need to write and read to perform well at work, school, or social situations. Good writing makes this easier by providing a way to clearly share ideas and knowledge.

Samuel Johnson, an early 18th-century English writer, once said that “writing comes hard if it’s not written with effort.” This idea still holds today, as the internet allows anyone to be a writer. But, reading remains crucial and remains widely appreciated.

Good writing requires skills beyond just having knowledge of a subject. It demands crafting sentences that are clear and easy to read. The harder it is to read a sentence, the more effort it requires, and thus, the more likely we are to lose interest. To write well, it’s important to practice and develop this skill.

Storytelling is another essential element of good writing. People love listening to and reading stories because they can make even complex ideas accessible and entertaining. When you read a well-told story, you’re more likely to remember it and even pass it on to others.

Finally, a good writer should also effectively convey information. This goes beyond merely telling a story and includes explaining facts, statistics, and other details that add depth and credibility to a piece of writing.

C2,"Given this story: Philadelphia Avenue I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened the humidity thickened into a palpable prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. Toward the end of the block, I turned onto the quiet tree-lined street of brick-fenced front yards which lent the area a homely feeling of familiarity, yet unfamiliarity.   The sidewalk sloped a foot or two from the base of the stone fence to the side of the road, creating an odd angle at the intersection. At the corner, a massive tree provided a perfect point to lean against, while a bench sat under its broad branches with a view of the street.  This bench, however, had been stripped of all paint and seemed as though it might collapse from my weight. I kept walking, only to be stopped by the feeling of being watched, and glanced back over my shoulder. As I turned around, a figure in the corner of my eye caught my attention.  In that second, an almost electric surge raced through my blood, the world seemed to freeze. I recognized him instantly. A tall, slender, bald man whose body was almost skeletal in appearance. He wore a dark business suit and dark sunglasses despite the dusk. As I stared, he turned and walked towards the corner, then disappeared around it as the wind rustled through the trees. I stood frozen, my breath suspended, then the spell broke, and I continued my walk. As I took another step, I paused. I turned to stare in the direction he went, and the ch.

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. At twilight, the air was thick with humidity and had a prickly feeling. It made my walk more exciting. I was nearly to the end of the block when I turned onto a quiet street with trees and fences. I felt at home but strange. The pavement had a weird slope, making the corner a bit odd. At the corner was a large tree. It was a good place to rest, and a bench was nearby under the tree's shade. I looked at the bench, but it seemed unstable and old. The paint was worn away.

I kept walking, but my feeling of being watched made me look back. I saw a man in the corner of my eye. My body reacted, and I felt a shock. I recognized the man. He was tall, thin, and almost like a skeleton. He wore a dark suit and sunglasses even though it was getting dark. As I watched, he walked towards the corner and then disappeared around it. The world seemed to stop for a moment. I was frozen, unable to move, and then suddenly I could again. I turned to watch him again, and in that moment, I knew something was about to happen. But, when I turned back, he was gone. As I took another step, I stopped and wondered what just happened and where he had gone. Then, I"

C2,"Given this story: Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Amateur Astronomer - The Newcomer A newcomer to amateur astronomy may wish to make a start in the following way: 1. Buy an inexpensive pair of binoculars. 2. Read a couple of introductory books about astronomy. 3. Borrow from the library any books about star charts, planisphere and constellations. 4. Go outside and have a look at the night sky. 5. Visit a planetarium and try out a telescope. 6. If possible join a local astronomical society. 7. Try to get hold of an inexpensive telescope. 8. Observe, observe, observe! As the newcomer gets more advanced he can then invest in a better telescope. What is a Planisphere? A planisphere is a type of star chart which enables the user to locate stars, planets and constellations throughout the year in any latitude. A map of the sky is divided into many sections and the outer edge of the planisphere rotates in relation to the pole star. The planisphere makes it easy to locate and follow any object in the sky throughout the year. It is very useful to the beginner as he learns how to use it. As well as telling you what is up in the sky it also gives information on how it is visible. What is a Constellation? A constellation is.

Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past 50 years. Not long ago, it was hard to find maps of stars and books on how to do astronomy. There weren't many tools for looking at the stars, and only a few books told about them. Nowadays, you can buy almost any tool you need. Someone who wants to start doing astronomy can do the following: 1. Buy a cheap pair of binoculars. 2. Read some easy books about the stars. 3. Borrow books about maps of the stars, a device called a planisphere, and constellations. 4. Go outside and look at the night sky. 5. Go to a place where they show stars, like a planetarium, and try a telescope. 6. Join a group of people who like stars too. 7. If you can, buy a cheap telescope. 8. Look at the sky a lot. As someone gets better, they can buy a better telescope. A planisphere is a kind of map that helps you find stars, planets, and shapes made by stars called constellations.

Story:
The way we speak about art nowadays seems to emphasize the idea that an artist must always rebel against the art of their contemporaries. Today, we praise art as being unique, revolutionary and shocking, and we feel proud when we admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. 

The history of art has seen many artists challenging traditional concepts. There have been many moments when the world of art seemed to go through a phase of radical change. These times of change often involve the breaking down of barriers and the breaking away from traditional art forms, followed by a period of recovery, consolidation and the emergence of new art styles and movements.

However, it is important to remember that not all artistic developments result in a radical departure from traditional forms. There are cases where artists have developed new techniques and styles without abandoning the old forms. Some artists continue to work within traditional constraints and yet manage to produce innovative and thought-provoking art. 

Artistic evolution, like any other process of change, involves a mixture of continuity and change. It is a delicate balance between the need for innovation and the desire to maintain a connection to tradition. 

Artists have often been seen as figures of rebellion. However, it is also important to consider them as creators of new forms of beauty and as individuals who contribute to the rich cultural heritage of humanity. In the end, it is the capacity"

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point. It is true that until these changes occurred there was little market for clothing and that individual pieces would be designed and made to fit a particular purpose rather than a specific person. However, fashion as a phenomenon predates the rise of the modern capitalist market place. For the majority of its history, fashion has been about more than simply the way people dress. It has been an expression of political ideology, social position, religious belief, and aesthetic sensibility. It has reflected changes in technology, economic development, cultural trends, and individual choice, while simultaneously shaping these in turn. Fashion has been a way of articulating personal identity, of asserting group membership, and of demarcating social boundaries. It has been both a source of power and a form of subordination. Clothing, in its various forms, has always had a profound impact on how people have seen the world around them and how they have been seen by others. This is true of ancient Greece, where the way a person dressed could tell another all sorts of things, including which god or god.

Fashion has a very long history. Many people think it started with the growth of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. But really, fashion is about more than clothes. It tells us about where we came from and what we want to be. Fashion comes from our need to express who we are and where we belong. It lets others know our values and our position in society. Clothes show our political views, religious beliefs, and our sense of style. They also show our economic standing. Fashion has been important since ancient times. In ancient Greece, people's clothes could tell you about their social class and the gods they worshipped. So, fashion is a big part of our history and identity. It connects us to the past while also shaping our future. It's important to remember this as we choose what to wear every day.

C2,"Given this story: Metals It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. 248802900.jpg This stone like object was not as hard as rock but unlike a piece of clay it couldn’t be squashed. It seemed to be an entirely new material. When this happened for the first time we can never know, but it may have been in the Mesolithic era (around 13000 - 7000 B.C.). The shiny pebble was found in a river bed not far from home. Its brilliance must have aroused the interest of some inquisitive person in the group. What was this odd little stone that could be so shiny ? Through a trial and error process, this person soon found that this pebble could be rubbed smooth and polished. A sharp edge could be obtained on this unknown material and the object could then be used as a cutting tool. This was a completely new concept to the people of that day and age, the idea that something which was not a flint or a chert or a piece of quartz could still be used for hunting and cutting purposes, was indeed a novel idea! This was the first step toward the utilization of metals by mankind, a step that would prove to be one of the greatest in the long march of progress. The identification of the pebble as a non-crystalline metal, perhaps copper or gold, set the stage for one of.

In the Stone Age, a long time ago, people used rocks and wood for tools. One day, a person found something very special while near a river. They found a shiny yellow stone. It wasn't hard like a rock, but it wasn't soft like clay. They thought that maybe it was a new kind of material.

This happened during a time called the Mesolithic era, around 13,000 to 7,000 B.C. The shiny stone was near their home and they thought it was very strange. They tried to rub it, and found that they could make it smooth and shiny. They could also make it into a sharp tool to cut things.

People then realized that this shiny stone could be used for other things besides flint or quartz. This was a big step for people at that time. Later, they found out that the shiny stone was probably a metal, maybe copper or gold. This led to the start of using metals for tools and other things. This was very important because it helped people a lot in the future.

They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. Vienna in autumn is magical. The city is steeped in rich cultural history and its beauty is reflected in the magnificent architecture, the music that is ingrained in its very being and the art that adorns its buildings. Even the streets and the parks have a certain charm, an inexplicable allure. A wander through the city is a sensory delight. The city’s rich architectural history, its parks, fountains and street cafes were irresistible to a photographer like me. I had spent hours in different parts of the city, capturing the beauty and elegance, the colours and textures and the reflections in the windows, of a city I had fallen in love with. That day was no different, though I felt something more, a strange stirring that I was unable to ignore. My attention was drawn to an obscure corner of a small park on the Ringstrasse, not far from where I was standing. I had visited the park several times during my previous visits, never quite capturing what I was looking for, a certain kind of magic that was elusive, an essence I could never quite find or define. Perhaps it was the way the soft afternoon sunlight played on the leaves or the way shadows danced on the stone walls that made me turn to look at that corner once more.

C2,"Given this story: Enough Sleep? Tiredness it is often claimed has become the modern condition. As the richer busier countries have grown so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings.  The modern lifestyle and its demands to perform and compete can be overwhelming and lead us towards anxiety which keeps us alert. Also, people’s diet, lack of exercise, the amount of alcohol or coffee consumed can lead to a disruption of our sleeping patterns. Ineffective treatment of anxiety and stress, lack of awareness of the problems and their causes is an issue that affects people of all age groups. Poor quality sleep affects cognitive function during the day and causes long-term damage to the body. Solution: It’s important to identify and manage stress to better the quality of sleep. Developing a daily routine, getting enough exposure to sunlight, reducing screen time before bedtime, and keeping the bedroom conducive to sleep can help. It is recommended to reach out to medical professionals in case of persistent issues with sleep. The Importance of Sleep Sleep is a natural, healthy and essential state of being for all living beings. A full night’s sleep is vital for the overall functioning of a body and mind. It plays a major role in our body’s ability to repair itself, regenerate and rejuvenate itself. The body uses this time to repair tissues, synthesise proteins, consolidate memories, and regulate hormones and emotions. Sleep also helps the body fight off infections, as the body produces more protective cytokines during rest. It also improves.

Story: The modern life can be hectic and busy, which often leads to a lack of sleep. This lack of sleep is so common that it has been dubbed 'tiredness.' Many people feel overwhelmed because they have so much to do in their day-to-day lives. These feelings of anxiety and stress can stop us from relaxing and sleeping well. In addition to that, our lifestyle choices like diet, alcohol or coffee consumption and exercise can all affect how well we sleep. Not treating stress and anxiety correctly can also have negative impacts on how well we sleep. If we aren't getting enough quality sleep, it can affect our ability to think clearly during the day, and long-term, it may cause damage to our bodies. To improve our sleep, it's important to reduce stress, establish a daily routine, get sun exposure, and avoid screens before bedtime. It's always a good idea to contact a medical professional if sleep issues persist.

Sleep is vital for our physical and mental well-being. During sleep, our bodies work on repairing and rejuvenating itself. It helps us to consolidate memories and regulate hormones. It even helps the body to fight infections. So, getting enough sleep each night is crucial for maintaining a healthy, happy life.

Ralph's home life had been unconventional, to say the least; his family was scattered about the globe and he had no close relations in the same city with him.  The large house with its dimly lit rooms held no warmth nor comfort for Ralph's heart, yet he felt something akin to a shudder as he stepped across the threshold.  His hand reached out to flick the light switches in the hallway; a moment's darkness ended and his home sprung to life around him.  This home was one that he shared with several roommates, who had become not much more than acquaintances.  Ralph felt a bit disconcerted as he made his way down the hallway; he had become increasingly aware over the past couple of weeks that the strangers he had grown to be accustomed to living with seemed to have grown ever stranger.  There were no voices coming from the living room, no laughter, no muffled sounds of the television from the kitchen or the low hum of a radio being played in one of the bedrooms.  Ralph felt the eerie sensation of emptiness that came upon him every time his roommates had ventured out into the world for days or weeks at a time; but this was the first time that the lingering solitude felt threatening.  With the uneasy realisation that this loneliness was unnerving him, Ralph began to feel a familiar and unsett.

One day, Ralph noticed that his roommates had been gone for a long time. He missed their voices and laughter. It made him feel lonely and a bit nervous. He wished they were there to make the house feel less empty. He hoped they would come back soon.

Remember, this is the original text:
""Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day.""

""Ralph's home life had been unconventional, to say the least; his family was scattered about the globe and he had no close relations in the same city with him.""

""The large house with its dimly lit rooms held no warmth nor comfort for Ralph's heart, yet he felt something akin to a shudder"
C2,"Given this story: Heritage The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously we feel connected to our personal heritage usually we know who and what our grandparents were and we will have heard stories about how they lived. Heritage is not only related to the past but also refers to what people leave to the future generation. Hence heritage gives people the chance to feel a sense of belonging, and as a result the ability to develop a deeper understanding and connection to the world that surrounds them. Heritage is not only about the physical items of our past, it’s about our own personal and societal identities as well. We believe that heritage contributes to our sense of who we are, it shapes our values and ethics and molds our personalities. In a sense, it helps to make us who we are. For this reason it is vital that heritage, both tangible and intangible, is safeguarded and passed on to future generations. This gives them the chance to learn from the past, understand their heritage, and make the most of the opportunities that are being presented to them today.  We believe that, like any investment, it’s our collective duty to ensure the future of our heritage, both for our children and their children. Our collective heritage is an invaluable resource, a cultural treasure, as well as an economic resource, and must not be allowed to disappear.  Our heritage helps us identify with the place where we live. It gives us a sense of belonging and pride and aids us in understanding the world around us. Understanding and appreciating heritage therefore becomes an important part of the learning process. As a result, heritage is crucial not only to.

A remarkable production of the famous play, Othello, was taken from Stratford to London. I had written an unfavorable review when the play opened. I was not pleased with how the actor Ray Fearon, who portrayed Othello, appeared to me. I thought he was too young for the role, and criticized his acting. However, when I saw the show in London, I felt ashamed for my original opinion, because Ray Fearon gave an excellent performance. Othello is one of Shakespeare's best plays, and seeing it in London made me realize how talented and versatile its actors are.

Now that I have seen Othello in London, I am very happy to say that Ray Fearon played his role brilliantly. When I first saw the show, I was too young to fully understand Othello's complex character. It was a wrong decision on my part to criticize Ray's acting as I couldn't see the complete picture. Othello is a complex play with many emotions and I feel grateful that I got to see it in London and experience the great acting of Ray Fearon. The original London run of this play ended up being a fantastic decision for everyone who went to watch it.

From now on, I will try to hold back my judgment on an actor's performance, especially when it comes to Othell"

C2,"Given this story: Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal. Lions in fact have a highly social and complex social structure and use hunting skills honed over millennia to take down prey many times larger than themselves. But in the heat of the hunt this social structure can unravel, revealing that these apparent team players can in fact turn into highly individualistic and sometimes even brutal animals. In a typical male-dominated pride the leader is the most dominant of the males who ensures that he gets the best lionesses to mate with, often forcibly when necessary. But the leader isn't always in charge of the hunt. A more dominant lion, from either his pride or another pride may take control, as long as he is more successful in killing something. Often, fights over dominance result in serious injuries and occasionally in death. While lionesses, who are less aggressive and socially dominant than the males, do bring down the prey, which they share with the males, they take the least desirable and smaller parts of it. The males then fight over the choice bits, often turning the post-hunt moment into a highly territorial and aggressive affair. This sort of fighting is a common behaviour among lions, occurring whenever any individual decides he deserves more than he's getting. The most common cause of death in lions under 12 months old is fighting with other lions. While the lions may be well-trained for survival, they also show their baser instincts in times of stress.

Lions are known as social animals, working together to catch their prey. But during the hunt, their social structure unravels. Their complex society often turns into a more individualistic and even brutal state. In a typical male-dominated pride, the most dominant male is the leader. He is in charge of choosing which lionesses to mate with. But sometimes, another male from within or even another pride will take over, as long as he is more successful. Fights can ensue over dominance, often resulting in serious injuries and sometimes death. Lionesses, who are less aggressive and social than males, help bring down the prey, but they end up with the less desirable parts. The males fight over the best parts. This aggressive behavior is common among lions, happening when any individual feels he deserves more than he's getting. In lions under 12 months old, the common cause of death is fighting with other lions. In times of stress, even well-trained lions reveal their baser instincts.

This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. Tito, the first private tourist to visit the International Space Station in 2001, wants to send these two to the Red Planet and the pair will be selected from the ‘crew’ of a private, non-governmental mission. The would-be Martian pioneers will have to apply online, go through a rigorous selection process including psychological, medical and technical tests and a live broadcast interview with the public. A successful candidate will need to pay $500,000 to reserve a place on the list of applicants. The final two will pay the full fee to be selected for the trip. No further details have been revealed but it is thought each seat could cost up to $20m, including a four-month training period and five years of medical follow-ups. Tito’s company, Inspiration Mars, has unveiled the design for the spacecraft at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. The craft will consist of two dome-shaped habitats on a cylindrical base to be launched on top of a Falcon 9 rocket. One dome will house two astronauts and the other the capsule which will remain in the orbit of Mars for a short time after landing on a four-metre-wide lander on 14 August 2018.

C2,"Given this story: Garbage in garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be. Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip.  The UK recently announced plans to charge families for each rubbish bag they produce. At first glance this seems environmentally sound and economically sensible, but it may not be. The concept of charging per bag is part of the “pay as you throw” policy that’s been adopted in some American cities like San Francisco and Washington DC. The logic is that if people pay to dispose of their waste then they will create less of it and thereby reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfill. In turn, this reduces the environmental impact and helps local government save money on waste disposal. It seems to make sense, but is the evidence clear cut? Charges for rubbish bags work in some cases, but not in others. One problem is that different countries have quite distinct cultures when it comes to waste production and recycling, which means that a one-size-fits-all solution won’t work everywhere. For example, in Italy the government abolished the rubbish tax in 2008 and replaced it with a pay-as-you-throw system. But as one Italian recycling expert said at the time, “Italians are used to seeing rubbish as a service. People expect to be paid for their rubbish, not to pay for it”.  In New Zealand a pay-as-you-throw scheme was introduced in Nelson in the 1.

Output the generated story directly. A man in England is planning to charge families for the rubbish they make. They say this is good for the environment and helps save money. Some places in America already do this, but the effect is not always good. It works in some places, but not in others. This is because each country has a different way of dealing with rubbish. People's habits are difficult to change. Charging money for rubbish might not be the answer for all countries. So, just like everything else, you need to be careful when you decide to charge for rubbish. Doing this could have a different effect on people in different places. The problem with doing this in the UK is that people there don't like to pay for rubbish. They are used to it being a free service. So we will have to wait and see if this works in the UK or not. Doing this in America has had different results in different places. That means we can't be sure if it will work in England or not. We will have to wait and see. It is always good to be careful when you decide to charge for things. It is important to remember that people react differently in different places. That is true for rubbish and many other things. Different places have different cultures, and you need to remember that when making decisions. So, be careful when deciding to charge for rubbish. People might not like it if it'"

I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans hordes of people food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch.  To my surprise the racecourse was a mere few hundred meters from the centre of the village, I'm sure the organisers of this goat racing day would have hoped for a larger venue. However it was buzzing, a hive of energy and excitement. This day started in 1988 when the local police force (TTPS) started a community race called the ‘Buccoo Goat Race’ to promote tourism and fun in the community and raise money for various charities. Over the years this race had evolved to what is now known as the Buccoo Goat Racing Day. The goats are all named after popular soca and calypso tunes, a nod to Trinidad’s vibrant musical culture. The excitement grew when the official party arrived, with local celebrities, MPs and even one of the policemen from the original race starting line up, to wave the flag and kick things off. The Races There are a total of four races in the day and the goats were all lined up in the starting corral. The goats are all named after popular soca and calypso tunes, a nod to Trinidad’s vibrant musical culture.

C2,"Given this story: 0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. Michael Bentley (ed.), The Making of Modern Europe (1996), pp. 4–5. 365 The problems of writing history with the aid of oral sources are illustrated by the case of the American scholar and civil rights activist, Bayard Rustin. It is no surprise that the oral testimonies from Rustin’s black friends and supporters were more positive than those from his white friends. Rustin, who was a homosexual, was also deeply criticised for his views on sexuality, which some of his other former friends thought did not match his civil rights commitment. Rustin wrote a two-part autobiography and there is a wealth of oral material as well as correspondence. It is interesting to see how the different sources can be used to re-create the personality of the person being studied and the period in which he or she lived. One of the most exciting things about oral sources is that they can reveal parts of the past which are not otherwise documented, bringing to light the experiences of whole sections of society which have been previously ignored. However, they can also be misleading.

The trend for historians to use oral history has become more popular. This method has some difficulties. It's wrong to believe a person's testimony completely. People can influence each other during interviews, and this can affect the truth. Michael Bentley showed this with The Making of Modern Europe. An example is Bayard Rustin, an American scholar and civil rights activist. Rustin’s black friends gave more positive testimonies than his white friends. Rustin was also criticized for his views on sexuality. Rustin wrote a two-part autobiography, and there are many oral sources as well as letters. The different sources help reveal the personality of the person being studied and the times they lived in. Oral sources can be exciting, as they reveal parts of the past not documented before. However, they can be misleading. Memories can be selective and stories can be exaggerated or distorted. The interviewer can be influenced by the interviewee, and this is a problem. The subject of interviews in oral history is very important. It's as essential as the source itself.

Its walls were painted white like an alabaster angel. Its roof had gables, which were the shape of two bunches of grapes. It was a house of many rooms. Susan used one as her bedroom, another as her kitchen, another as her parlour, another as her lounge. They were all full of objects which she loved.

He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. ‘I’m a little dinosaur’ he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs.  Living Dinosaur My son explained that these dinosaurs were big and powerful and that they were carnivorous. He said he remembered one of the programmes being about a Velociraptor. He remembered that there was a large dinosaur, about 10 times the size of the Velociraptor, called a T-Rex that eats it.  He also said he remembered learning that dinosaurs became extinct long before humans were even around, ‘about 65 million years ago’.  Educational TV programmes have the potential to open up whole new worlds and inspire curiosity and learning in children. The question is, to what extent are these programmes effective for children’s learning? TV, the Internet, Mobile Phones and other technologies have changed the way we learn and teach forever. This article will look at what is sometimes referred to as ‘Screen Learning’ or ‘Screen-Based Learning’ to see how effective it is. Screen Learning The term ‘screen learning’ refers to the use of a screen as an educational tool. This includes TV, computer, smartphone and tablet apps, and online educational platforms.  The idea is that the combination of moving images, sound, text, interactivity and other multimedia elements can make screen learning more engaging and effective than traditional teaching methods.  Some of the most popular educational apps and platforms include ‘Du.

Last week I saw my little six-year-old son eating his noodles in an interesting way. He held the noodles with his teeth and pretended to be a dinosaur, looking fierce. He told me he was copying a scene from a TV show he saw recently. He remembered that the dinosaurs in the show were large and strong and ate meat. He even knew the names of some of the dinosaurs like the Velociraptor. He also learned about the T-Rex, a big dinosaur that ate a Velociraptor. He recalled that dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago, before humans existed. 

Screen learning is a teaching method that uses a screen, such as TV, computers, smartphones or tablets. This includes educational videos, games, and apps. 

Many people think screen learning is better than traditional teaching because it uses different media like moving images, sounds, text, and interactivity. 

Some popular educational apps and platforms are Duolingo, ABCya, and PBS Kids. These apps and platforms are helpful for children’s learning. But do they work well? That's what we need to explore! 

TV, the internet, mobile phones, and other technologies have changed the way we teach and learn. We want to know how effective it is.

In the United Kingdom, you can now attend a unique workshop where you can learn how to build your own bike using bamboo. A course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, provides you with a custom-designed bamboo frame and a weekend of hands-on training.

Bamboo is an ideal material for bicycles because it is lightweight, robust, and has a low environmental impact. This means that it takes less energy to cultivate and process bamboo compared to aluminium or carbon-fibre.

After the course, the writers embarked on a 200 km (124 miles) ride through the picturesque countryside of rural France, testing their newly built bikes on cobbled roads and steep hills. They discovered that despite their lack of experience with bike-building and bamboo, the bikes performed well and easily handled the most challenging inclines.

C2,"Given this story: Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. Vervet monkeys have a complex social system in which every monkey knows every other monkey, so the dominant male became upset and chased the newcomer away. The stranger was not about to give up so easily. He returned the next day, and the dominant male once again chased him away. The chase was followed by a day of “grooming,” but this grooming was not a sign of friendship. “Grooming,” as a word, has an innocent connotation; the image of two friends carefully picking lice from each other’s hair is very charming. The vervet monkey version of grooming has less appeal. The dominant male and all his friends descended on the stranger and attacked him, pulling out his hair and scratching his skin, a prelude to an all-out assault. It didn’t matter that the stranger was smaller than they were. He stood his ground, defended himself, and continued to observe the group. He was a persistent young male seeking to gain status as a male resident of this particular community. A group of vervet monkeys, like a human family, has a pecking order. The dominant male is at the top and the rest fall below him in a hierarchy of dominance and submission. In the monkey group, the dominant male is “big boss,” the second monkey is “right-hand man,” the third is “third man,” and.

The world is full of artworks. These artworks are a subject of great interest. As time passed, there's a problem with art theory. Art theory is having a problem. This is due to the fact that artworks are physical objects. What this means is, they're made outside our minds. 

These artworks are not just objects but also products. They are produced and can be touched. This third book deals with Aesthetics. Aesthetics is a subject where many theories exist. But, we can't reach these theories due to the physicality of art. 

Our series has three parts: ethics, aesthetics, and politics. Each part discusses a different subject. These three subjects can't be dealt with using old methods. The new book is the second part of the third part of the series on Aesthetics. 

Aesthetics was previously treated like a science. But now, it's clear it's also an ethical subject. Art and ethics are now seen as connected. 

We're presenting a new book on Aesthetics that shows this connection. This book will help us understand the relationship between the art and the ethical disciplines. The goal is to make art and ethics easier to understand for people. With this, we hope to solve the problem in art theory.

However, I find it uncomfortable after an hour or so, and have never understood how anyone can spend an entire weekend on a beach without getting bored.

It is not as if I take my dog for a daily stroll on the beach, I am not that affluent or eccentric. If I am staying at a seaside hotel I might take a constitutional but I would need a very good reason to get up early in the morning and walk on sand.

However it takes some organisation to set up the nets and posts and I only do this a couple of times a year at most. Sailing in sand and surf is also a good excuse for lying in the sun and feeling the sea breeze on your cheeks. It requires a considerable amount of preparation and equipment but I suppose that is part of the fun.

C2,"Given this story: Art on TV Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details.  The latest attempt, a new BBC series, The Moment, is already under fire for its simplistic approach. It uses a new generation of high-definition technology to try to give viewers a different kind of experience but the approach is more akin to a quiz show than a documentary. The programme invites celebrities to select their favourite work of art and tries to persuade an audience to choose the same piece. At the end, two art historians give a brief introduction to the work and, as in an episode about The Scream by Edvard Munch, its context in society and history. It is not the ideal format for such works as Munch's, which do not lend themselves to a quick summary. One of the series' few redeeming qualities was that The Scream was broadcast in full - a high-definition version of the painting. At least, viewers could see the colours - vivid greens, blues and reds. But, in the hands of TV producers, the art, and its history, is turned into mere trivia. Television could do so much more. A good example of what might be done was a TV documentary on the Renaissance in Florence in the 15th Century which intertwined the painting, sculpture and architecture of the period with the city's social and political history. .

In a recent TV program, BBC tried a new way of showing art. It tried to present visual arts like paintings and sculptures through a HD camera which could let viewers see the whole artworks and every detail of the pieces.

But, this program, named ""The Moment"", was not loved by everyone. Some people found it more like a quiz show. It asked famous people to select their favorite works of art and to persuade other viewers to do the same. At the end, two historians explained why that artwork is important.

This approach didn't work for all kinds of art, like ""The Scream"" by Edvard Munch. Munch's paintings are too complex to be quickly summarized. 

Even though the program wasn't perfect, there was a small positive aspect: people could finally see Munch's ""The Scream"" in high definition. Viewers could see the painting's vibrant colors.

However, this show is a good example of how TV could do more for art. Just like a previous TV documentary about the Renaissance in Florence showed, it would be better to connect the art with its time period and context. This would help people understand the significance of the artwork.

So, TV shows about art should give viewers a complete experience instead of turning them into mere trivia. They should help people understand the art better.

Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews.

If you haven’t seen it, then his work can’t be explained to you in words, only seen. He played the role of Satyaki, a doctor in a hospital. The camera didn’t give away more than was needed. The script gave away less. But the actor, who was the driving force behind Satyaki’s character, never made it feel as if he was merely acting. It’s like watching a real doctor, with a real heartbeat, do his real job, right in front of you. There was a certain simplicity, a certain dignity in Parambrata’s depiction of Satyaki that spoke volumes. You felt you were witnessing a real moment rather than an actor playing a role. The craft was almost unseen, seamless. In the recent ‘Ferrari ki Sawaari’, which had actors Shahid Kapoor and Boman Irani, there were moments when you could see the craft, but the disbel.

And not thankfully by some huge-budget mega-hyped multi-media extravaganza but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century.  The Hayward has pulled off an uncommonly imaginative and uncharacteristically accessible show. It is a wonder to see the staid gallery transformed by the whizz and buzz of its contents. The Kinetic Art Exhibition’s curator has cleverly used the gallery’s large spaces, in a way which allows the visitor to really get close to the exhibits. The visitor is able to walk through the works, touch them, and experience them in a way which most galleries discourage. And the Hayward, in a coup de grace which even the Saatchi Gallery could not match, has managed to provide a kinetic experience right at the entrance. Here, as you wander through, you encounter the most extraordinary of inventions: the self-operating kinetic sculpture by Eduardo Paolozzi, a motorised, revolving display cabinet which takes you on a tour of an apparently chaotic collection of postcards and images from popular culture. The exhibition is an exhaustive exploration of the idea of movement in art. It opens with an introduction to some of the pioneers of kinetic art such as Naum Gabo and Alexander Calder who started out in the 1930s and 40s. The show goes on to cover a number of different aspects of kinetic art in four different parts. Firstly, there are works that create movement through electricity, like.

It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked with their destinies. Paul Simon, born in the Newark, New Jersey, on October 13, 1941, was one of them. He was a middle-class Jew who grew up in the suburb of Queens in New York City. The son of Richard L. and Belle Simon, Paul attended Forest Hills High School and went on to study music at Queens College. A talented singer and guitarist, he first came to notice on the thriving New York folk scene, where he was associated with the likes of Dave Van Ronk and Tom Paxton, two of the most respected names in the circuit. A gifted composer, he began writing songs that showed flashes of brilliance and a sharp wit. It was on the folk circuit that he met his first collaborator, Art Garfunkel. They started off as a teenage duo called Tom & Jerry, but soon after rechristened themselves as Simon & Garfunkel. Their first hit came in 1957, in the shape of the doo-wop song, Hey Schoolgirl, which they recorded under the moniker, True Tunes. However, it was Simon's composition of The Sound of Silence in 1965 that established them as the most successful folk-rock act of the 1960s.

Paul Simon was a student at Queens College, where he studied music. He was good at singing and playing guitar. He started to become famous in New York's folk scene. This was a group of people who loved singing traditional songs. There he met his friend and partner, Art Garfunkel. They formed a duo called Tom & Jerry. 

They later changed their name to Simon & Garfunkel. Their first hit was a song called 'Hey Schoolgirl' in 1957. But they gained more popularity in 1965 with 'The Sound of Silence'. This song helped them become the most successful folk-rock act in the 1960s. Their second album, 'Sounds of Silence', came in 1965.

C2,"Given this story: POETRY RECITALS At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. Poeetry recitals will be judged not by their relevance to the society in which they take place, but by the standard of their language, emotion, and thought. The language, the music of the words, the rhythmic flow of the thoughts, the power of their expression, their resonance with the truth of things known and unknown, will be our criteria. We will not concern ourselves with their reflection of the politics of the time, their contribution to a current trend of thought, or the state of the poets' personal life. If they do not succeed, in their time or in ours, as poetical expression, we will not rate them as poetry, or even as verse, but we will not be able to avoid them and we will not dismiss them out of hand. They will, nevertheless, be a part of what has been called the ""great tradition"" of poetry. The greatness of this tradition lies in its capacity for survival, and for being of use, as a guide and as a companion. We know that the poets of the past may have failed as human beings, but if they have passed the test of time as poetry, they cannot be dismissed. The greatness of a poet does not lie merely in the fact that he or she can produce something in the language of a period, or that he or she was able to express the sentiments or the philosophy of the time. If that were all, we would simply dismiss the po.

Poetry recitals have always been a bit confusing. People in the past never understood the meaning of them, and today, it is still a mystery to many. But the true value of poetry can be measured by the emotion it brings, how the words flow, and how it relates to life's mysteries. No matter how irrelevant it seems, we cannot avoid it and it will always have a place in our culture. Even if some poets didn't lead a good life, their work still plays a part in our history. It might not always make sense or reflect what's happening in the world, but it is still an important part of the tradition. We keep it because it helps us understand life, and it's always there for us when we need it. So, no matter if a poet was good or bad in their time, their work will always be remembered in the great tradition of poetry. The greatness of a poet isn't just about how well they can write for their time. The meaning of their work goes beyond that, and that's what makes it special. So, we keep their work because it's part of our heritage and it helps us understand our world better.

C2,"Given this story: CRYING Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness.  Much of the research on tears has been conducted on rats. The social behaviour of rats is a good model for human behavior in many respects. Their responses are usually very direct and can easily be elicited. They are small and easily manipulated, and for most experiments, they don’t need to be anesthetised. Research on rats has been invaluable in uncovering the social role of tears. In his book, “Tears,” published in 2001, D. J. Weston described an experiment by Dr. Robert J. Levine in the 1960s. Levine took two rats, one known as a dominant rat, and the other a subordinate rat. He placed the dominant rat in a small cage with the subordinate one on the other side of a thin wall. After a short while, the dominant rat showed signs of stress. The subordinate rat showed no signs of stress. In the experiment, a tearful subordinate rat was pitted against another subordinate rat who was not tearful. The tearful rat won, and it became dominant, having used tears as a sign of stress in the presence of the other rat to elicit sympathy and support from it. Thus the tearful rat climbed the social ladder. Tears were always seen as a sign of weakness. The rat experiments demonstrate that is not necessarily the.

Charles Darwin thought that crying, in people, didn't have a real reason. He made a big mistake. We don't really know why we cry, but he believed it happened without reason. Research on this has been mostly done on rats. These animals have similar behavior patterns to humans. It's simple to study them. Rats do whatever you ask them to and they don't need to be given any medicine. Dr. Robert Levine did an experiment in the 60's. He put a rat that was dominant and one that was subordinate in small cages. Dominant means it was the boss. Subordinate means it was the underdog. He could see that the boss rat was stressed. The underdog rat looked calm. Next, Levine put a tearful underdog against another underdog who didn't cry. The tearful rat won and became dominant, because it used tears as a sign of stress. The other rat showed pity and helped it. People thought crying was always a sign of weakness. The rat experiments proved it isn't always the case. We still need to study people more to understand why we cry, but rats provide some clues.

C2,"Given this story: Blogging: Confessing to the world Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into.  Apart from being a bad idea if you’re trying to avoid ex-partners or debt collectors, the point was that the whole notion of announcing that we are here and we are doing this is at odds with the ‘private’ nature of much of our lives.  I remember being shocked years ago when I visited Paris and saw a girl pull out her map right next to a busy crossroads, looking at it, then putting it back in her bag, clearly signalling to everyone where she was and what she was going to do.  Now, we live in an age where social media means that more and more people will happily share their every waking moment with their virtual friends, via various updates and status messages. And not just that: many also share their photos, their stories, their feelings – their thoughts.  This sharing is a great thing: it keeps us in touch, it allows us to express our creativity and build our brand. But, like the girl with the map, there’s that nagging element of being just a little too public.  So, the problem we face is one of transparency: how much is too much? How far do we push ourselves to share with the world at large the small details of our lives and how much should we leave to our circle of trust?  I’m not trying to tell anyone not to blog or tweet or share..

Once upon a time a website warned about a silly mistake. The website said that people who put their location on social media are advertising their whereabouts to anyone, like criminals or annoyed ex-boyfriends. 

It’s not good to share every little detail of your life. In the past, when you wanted to find a place, you would secretly open a map. People used to be more discreet. 

Now, people like to share their lives with others using social media. It’s great because it helps us stay in touch with friends and let people know what we are up to. But sometimes, we can share too much information with the wrong people. 

So the challenge is to find a good balance between being open and keeping some things private. Because, just like a map, sometimes too much information can lead to trouble. 

This is the story about how to use social media without being too open. It’s important because, even if it’s fun to talk about yourself, you should be mindful of how much you share with the world. 

Remember, your friends and family might get tired of hearing about your every move. It’s time to be a little more careful about what we share on the internet. This way, people won’t get bored with you and will continue to enjoy your company.

I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting.  We have so much food around us – in our kitchens and larders, from our supermarkets and takeaways and it seems such a shame to have it go to waste and yet, in some way, we do not feel worthy to cook it. This book is for people who cook every day; who have to think up a meal when they don’t have a particular occasion or who are so busy with work and family they hardly ever get to spend an hour making a meal. It is for those people who are intimidated by a complicated recipe and just want to make the simplest, best, most satisfying food they can for their family or for guests, or for themselves. There are some great little recipes in this book and I have picked some out which I particularly like: - The first is for roast chicken with rosemary and thyme with roast sweet potatoes. Now, there are a million roast chicken recipes out there but this one is different as it uses the zest of an orange instead of lemon. - I like the idea of a bacon and sausage casserole in one of the books I looked through which is made of leftover bits of ham and sausage, plus veg and some milk. - And on a more sophisticated note, the raspberry soufflé caught my eye for being simple and delicious.

C2,"Given this story: The Lure of the Kitchen When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is on the face of it an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long pressured menial - and badly paid. Chef is not a glamorous job, it is not a high paid job but it is one of the most creative. Cooking is a highly crafted skilled occupation. It has to be in order for it to be good. It may be hard, it may be tiring, it may be low status but cooking is an art and it is one of the most satisfying art forms I can think of. Like any artist chefs are driven not by wealth and status, but by the joy of their own mastery, the pleasure they take from their craft and the recognition they receive from others for the quality of what they do. I used to say to anyone who would listen: ""if you want to get close to the divine, then go into the kitchen"". In the kitchen you get to be a bit of a god. You have the power to nourish a community. To take raw material and in a few short hours turn it into something beautiful, delicious, life-enhancing, to bring pleasure to the table. You also have the power to destroy, to make people sick, unhappy, to ruin their day, to kill with neglect or thoughtlessness. But if you do it right you get to do something sublime. You feed other people. You nourish them in a very deep, very basic way. I also used to say that if you think cooking is easy, you try spending 15 hours in a kitchen without sleep..

Cooking and Becoming a Chef

When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. Most of my friends did not want to be chefs. Cooking is not one of the most wanted jobs. Chefs have a hard life: they work long hours, feel lots of pressure and do low paid work.

But being a chef can be very creative. A chef uses their skills to make good food. It needs to be good for it to be enjoyable. Being a chef is not easy. It can be tiring and not glamorous. But it can be very rewarding.

I told people, ""Cooking is a way to feel close to the divine."" A chef has the power to give good or bad food to people. They can make others happy or unhappy. They can even harm someone with bad food.

If a chef does a great job, they can do something wonderful. They help people eat well and feel happy. I also told my friends that if cooking is easy, just try doing it for 15 hours straight, without sleep. It is not easy at all!

Cooking is both a craft and an art. And becoming a chef is worth all the hard work and dedication. I am glad I became a chef and learned how to make people happy with delicious food. Cooking can be tiring, but it is also very rewarding. I believe that"

The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years.  Advertising on trial Page 2 of 33 Advertising on trial On top of that came the rise of public dissatisfaction with advertising the growing antipathy that the general public is supposed to have developed towards advertisements. 1 Public opinion on advertising is now more negative than it has ever been in modern times, said a study by a London market research firm at the end of 1991 2 And with that public discontent was a corresponding increase in political pressure on the advertising industry. The increasing pressure on the advertising industry has led to an increase in the level of public scepticism towards advertising. This in turn has meant an increase in the pressure on the advertising industry to explain itself and its practices in terms acceptable to the general public. This pressure has become more intense with the increased volume and frequency of regulatory and legal cases against the advertising industry as a whole. It is not only the consumer that is dissatisfied. Increasingly the industry s own clients are demanding better value for money for their advertising budgets. They expect not just a bigger sales bang for their advertising bucks but also a greater level of advertising quality. How do we deal with these pressures in a way that will increase the credibility of the advertising industry, not diminish it?

People became upset with advertisements, and the government took an interest in the matter. With all this new attention on advertising, the public's view of it became even more negative. The government increased regulations on advertisements and put pressure on the advertising industry to be more transparent. Clients began demanding better value for their advertising money. How could the advertising industry improve its image and regain the public's trust? In response to public demands, people started asking for well-thought-out advertisements with more consideration for their audience. This shift in expectation placed new challenges on the advertising industry, which had to find ways to meet these demands while remaining profitable.

C2,"Given this story: How to Write Poetry Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face.  The only thing you have to do is write the poem and write it as yourself. That, as you know, is the difficult part. I’ve tried to help you by distilling, if you’ll excuse the pun, some of the ideas that have proved most useful to me. If they help you a little, if you like just one or none of them, it’s all the same to me, for I can only write from my own experience, with the certainty that that is what I can only give. 1  WORK WITH THE CONSCIOUS MIND You work with the conscious mind. I do not believe, as the surrealists do, that you can conjure something from nothing. The mind is only aware of the conscious, for the subconscious is uncharted territory. So the best way to set about writing poetry is to start with a conscious idea. If you take away the conscious mind, you are no longer dealing with poetry: if you think that the mind is not involved, you have no notion of what poetry is. 2   CALL UP THE SUBCONSCIOUS If you take a word or image, it becomes a stimulus to the subconscious and if, in order to develop this image or word, you create an image or a situation, then your subconscious helps you out. But you must know what you are after: the word or the image has to be there, otherwise it.

Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like going on an adventure: you just have to follow your heart and do your best. There are a lot of ideas that can help you, but remember, there are no rules. The most important thing is to write from your heart and be true to yourself. 

First, start with an idea in your mind. This idea will give you a starting point for your poem. It's like a treasure map that guides you through your writing. 

Next, let your mind wander and explore your feelings. This will help you find words and images that express what you're trying to say. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. 

Finally, look at your poem and see what you think. Is it true to who you are? Does it feel right? If not, keep trying until it does. Remember, there is no one way to write poetry. As long as it comes from your heart, it's perfect.

So, just have fun and let your creativity flow. That's the secret to writing great poetry. Happy writing!

C2,"Given this story: Online Literary Criticism For All Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun? From the outset the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice however a certain amount of technical know-how was required at least in the early years.  By the mid-1990s, with the advent of the Web, most of the technical barriers to publishing online had been removed, and the Internet began to fulfil its early promise as a medium of easy and affordable self-expression. It offered an opportunity for people to express their opinions about the works of established authors. In the spirit of democracy, these views, no matter how absurd or uninformed they were, are now freely available online. Anyone, anywhere, can read what anyone else thinks about any book. It is this access to such a potentially vast and diverse array of views that makes the Internet an exciting medium for literary criticism. While there have been few systematic studies of the quality of online literary criticism, several recent discussions of it, notably in the Chronicle of Higher Education, suggest that while the quantity of online criticism has increased dramatically, the quality is generally disappointing. These critics suggest that most online criticism is overly subjective, and lacking in analytical sophistication. It's also the case that while many people are critical, relatively few are capable of writing a detailed, well-informed, and persuasive literary analysis. A literary critic needs a good grounding in literary theory, as well as extensive knowledge of the work that is the object of criticism, to make meaningful observations about it. Unfortunately, the ease with which people can publish their own work on the Web also makes it easy for those who have.

People on the internet can write and share their views about famous books without needing to know a lot about literature or have fancy skills. Since the internet began, more people have started doing this. Sometimes they talk about famous authors or even try to explain the meaning of a book. Many people find this interesting and fun.

Although many people now share their opinions, it is hard to know if they know what they are talking about. Some people who write about books may not be very clever or knowledgeable. This can make it tricky to know if what they say is true.

While the internet is a great place for people to talk about books, it can be hard to know how much we can trust what we read. The internet makes it easy for anyone to express their opinions, but this can also mean that sometimes these opinions are not very good. It is important to remember that just because something is easy to publish, it does not always mean it is worth reading.

Some people worry that because many opinions are easy to find, it is hard to know if we can trust them. They think that we should be careful when we read what others write. While the internet is a good place for people to express their thoughts about books, it can also be a confusing place.

He would have been more than happy if he had been driven on all their outings by Lily, but said nothing and did not drive himself. He had never in his life driven before and could not even think of learning to drive. Chen found himself in a bit of a fix, but could do nothing about it. He just kept on letting Lily take him around, without saying a word and not even daring to mention it. Lily loved the way her driving made Chen squirm and she loved it too when her older sister Mildred made the same face as Chen whenever she took her around. Lily and Mildred enjoyed teasing Chen in this way, and it was not really teasing; they were actually having fun. The outings would go on like this for some time.

Money no object. I wore the whole truly cowboy outfit and if you had the outfit you might be a cowboy. I also played golf in spikes- and in the desert, and I didn't even wear gloves because I was so ""manly."" You never knew when you might meet a movie star or other rich guys wearing the same thing. You wanted to look like a true cowboy. So we bought a bunch of old cowboy hats with $1000-worth of buckles on them and we were cowboys. Not cowboys from Texas or the Great Plains, but cowboys nonetheless. We'd be on the trail, all decked out, and we'd come up to a herd of longhorns or cows and we'd say ""C'mon boy"" or ""Git yer lazy ass over here,"" and we'd run up to them and try to touch em. I thought we looked and sounded cool. We would make fun of the guys who wore expensive cowboy boots who didn't wear spurs, who wore fancy belts that had nothing to do with working cattle or being a real cowboy. I mean, we were in Arizona, the land of Cowboys. You weren't really a cowboy unless you were an actual cowboy, born and raised and bred on the land. And I got the idea that I was a true cowboy just by wearing the costume and saying the words. I actually thought I knew what it was like to be.

In the Arizona desert, I wore very expensive cowboy boots and a cowboy hat with many shiny things on it. I didn't wear gloves or special shoes for golf because I thought it made me look like a real cowboy. In the desert, I sometimes met other people wearing the same clothes, and we all acted like cowboys. We'd call out to cows nearby and try to touch them. We thought we sounded and looked cool. I thought that wearing the clothes made me a true cowboy, but that's not really true. To be a real cowboy, you have to be raised on the land, and I wasn't. But I still liked dressing up and acting like a cowboy. The clothes and the words I used made me feel like a cowboy, but in reality, I was only pretending. Some people might think it's okay to wear fancy clothes and not use real cowboy equipment, but that's not what a true cowboy would do. We made fun of people who did that, but we did it ourselves. The desert was full of cowboys like us, and we thought we were the real deal. But the truth is, we were just pretending to be cowboys. We didn't have the real experience, and that's what makes a true cowboy. So, even though we tried our best to look and sound like cowboys, we were only pretending."

Output the generated story directly. A birder has a very bumpy day when an ominous wren bumps into a greenhouse. This bird is considered to be a symbol of divine knowledge. What do such symbols tell us about the importance humans place on birds? Paul Evans explores. 

The wren was causing a ruckus in the greenhouse, making it difficult to carry on with bird watching. The bird would continuously bang into the glass panes, creating a raucous racket. 

The wren is widely considered to be a bird of ill omen or a harbinger of doom. The ancient Romans, for example, believed that seeing one was a clear indication that an unpleasant event was looming. Similarly, in Norse mythology, the wren is considered a symbol of divination. 

However, the wren is not the only bird associated with a particular meaning or symbol. Many birds, from the majestic eagle to the humble sparrow, have been viewed as emblems of different virtues, ideas, or beliefs by cultures around the world. 

Take, for instance, the eagle, which is often viewed as a symbol of strength, vision, and freedom. Conversely, the dove is typically associated with peace and spiritual purity. Sparrows, on the other hand, have long been seen as harbingers of spring, or perhaps even good fortune. "

This can be very frustrating for the writer but also illuminating. Working on a script I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point.  In one of my favourite novels - David Lodge's Small World - there is a scene that takes place in a library in the ancient university city of Oxford. In the book, the scene takes up three pages of closely typed text, and it features one of Lodge's signature narrative techniques, which is to alternate the viewpoints of his characters in a single paragraph. In the scene, a young woman, one of Lodge's protagonists, is walking through the library to meet her boyfriend when she sees, out of the corner of her eye, an elderly man dressed in a long, black academic gown. The woman, who is also a novelist, assumes he is either a professor or a scholar. As she approaches, he asks if she can help him: he can't find his way around and has lost his sense of direction. The woman responds, and in a few minutes they strike up a conversation in which he tells her that he is a professor of medieval literature, that he is a specialist in Thomas Malory, the author of Le Morte d'Arthur, the great English translation of the Arthurian legend. For the rest of the scene, they talk at length about their views on Malory, on the role of the artist, the purpose of fiction, the politics of national literature and so on. The woman has a very good academic background herself and knows a great deal about literature and she is.

Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. Around the world, scientists are studying the changes which they hope will give us an insight into what sort of conditions we will be facing in the future. The main reason for global warming is the buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases which trap the Sun’s heat, leading to a rise in the temperature of the atmosphere. Although the changes won’t be the same everywhere, a few general statements can be made. Some areas will get hotter in the summer while in winter the temperatures in the same regions might drop more than usual.  What are the possible consequences of these changes in weather patterns? It is likely that we will see a greater incidence of droughts and floods, with some areas receiving too little rain while others are inundated. It’s also quite possible that the number of storms will increase. If all this is true, how should we prepare?

The Story: What is global warming?

Global warming is a significant issue for the world right now. It's the increase in the Earth's temperature. This rise in temperature is changing the weather all around the globe. The main cause of this change is due to gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat from the sun.

What happens if the world continues to heat up?

If global warming is not addressed, it may cause severe droughts, floods, and more intense storms in the future. To adapt to these changes, we can improve the efficiency of our buildings and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. It might require some investment, but it’s an investment in the future. It's an investment for the sake of the health of our planet and its inhabitants.

The consequences of global warming on the world are a great concern, but we can still make a difference. We can adapt our lifestyle, be more energy-efficient, and be part of the solution for a safer and healthier planet.

C2,"Given this story: Maps The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth’s surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. Maps may be drawn at varying scales, and as a consequence, the size of an area may be greatly altered. Therefore, when interpreting a map, it should be remembered that the size of a location as shown on the map is not necessarily its real size. For example, a map of England that measured one inch to ten miles might show the Thames estuary at 0.5 mm. This could be misleading since the real distance may be miles long. 2 MAPS 1.1 What is a map? A map is a tool for representing the real world in a different way. It is drawn on flat sheet (e.g. paper) and is designed to help people find out about the world, and to understand and communicate where places are. 1.2 What is the purpose of a map? The purpose of a map is to give us information about where places are, how far apart places are, and how to move from one place to another. They are also used to understand and interpret the physical, social and economic characteristics of different areas. 1.3 What is meant by a map scale? Scale is the relationship between distance on the map and distance in the real world. It helps us to find out how large an area is in real life. For example, a scale that says 1:10,000 means that one unit on the map is equal to 10,000 of.

Maps are pictures that help us find out about the world and where things are. They are not always real size, and we must be careful when using them to make sure we get the right information. To help us find out if things on a map are real size, we can use the scale, which tells us how big something is in the real world compared to how big it is on the map. For example, a map might have a scale that says 1:10,000, meaning one thing on the map is equal to 10,000 of the same thing in the real world. This helps us understand better how big or how far things are in reality.

In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. Susan Hallam: ""Music is a form of communication just as much as the spoken word. It has always played a vital role in human civilizations around the world. But it is in Britain in the 20th century that its influence has been most pronounced. Now many aspects of society have come to depend on music and technology. Music is not only an art form and entertainment medium. It's also been a vital factor in commercial culture and social life.

The music industry has gone through significant changes since the beginning of the 20th century. In those days, listening to music was considered a passive activity that was mainly done at home or in concert halls. With the introduction of the radio in the 1920s and television in the 1950s, however, music suddenly became more accessible. It could now be enjoyed in public places, and not just in private homes.

As technology advanced and more methods for listening to music became available, including records, tapes, CDs, and videos, music's role in society grew. Today, music has become an integral part of people's lives, and it's even used in advertising to promote products. However, because of its ever-growing presence, sometimes we lose sight of why music is important and how it affects us.

From being a source of entertainment and a form of communication, music has evolved into a vital factor in commercial and social life. Its widespread use in commercial culture and day-to-day activities means it's essential for many aspects of society. The impact of music on British society in the 20th century has been profound, as it has influenced and changed the way people live and interact. In conclusion, music is no longer just an art form, but it is a key component of daily life, and its influence on our society has only grown stronger over time.

A photographer may choose to photograph something because it is a subject of personal interest. A subject might be selected because of the emotional response it induces in the viewer. In any case , the selection of subject is an essential part of the photographic experience. This also involves the choice of camera and other equipment. The camera, in the case of 35mm and its equivalent is only a recording instrument , but can have an effect on how the subject is captured. A photographer may select a long lens to compress the elements of a landscape , or use a wide angle lens to exaggerate the scale of a building. A photographer may select a certain type of film to achieve a particular type of finish . Photography can be used to illustrate, advertise or record an event. Photographers have the capacity to use their medium to influence the way in which we see and interpret the world. The photographer s interpretation of reality involves more than mere description it involves selection and organization of a mass of data and distillation of its essence into a single image. The single image contains many elements such as the content , its composition , the lighting , the texture of the tone and even its mood. All of this is conveyed in a two dimensional format. This selection of material , it is important to note is not random , but is determined by the subject that the photographer is addressing , be it a person , place , event or concept.

When a photographer takes a picture, they pick what they want to show. They do this based on their experience, skills, and the things that they feel are important. A photographer may pick something to photograph because they like it. It could also be because it makes the viewer feel something strong. A person who takes pictures can choose from many different ways to take a picture. They can choose the camera and lenses they use, or pick special film to create the look they want. Photos can be used to tell a story, advertise something, or show an event. Photographers can show us how they see the world. This involves more than just taking a picture. It involves picking the important parts and organizing them. Then they show it in a way that we can see and understand. A well-taken picture tells a story that we can easily understand. It includes things like the content of the picture, its layout, the lighting, and the emotions it conveys. All of these things are shown in a flat image. This is determined by the subject of the picture and isn't picked at random. This makes the picture meaningful.

My father with my brother Maurice in tow had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls’ school I attended.  We lived in a small flat in Battersea, South London and I was the youngest of seven children, four of whom were boys. I was the third daughter, but the last. My father worked for British Overseas Airways Corporation. He had been a pilot during the War and was now a ground staff officer. I was fourteen years old and my father looked like he was in a mood. My mother would have said that he “had the hump’; a term I can’t translate. It means to be annoyed or in a bad temper. But my mother never used profanity; in fact, she never swore at all, and I was to follow that principle. ‘Look here it’s no good!’ my father shouted in exasperation. He was exasperated because I had done very badly in my school exams, but I wasn’t surprised. I was quite certain that I was going to fail and in fact, when I opened my test paper after the exam, I saw that I had, but it wasn’t just me that failed, everyone else did too! It turned out that it was a paper shortage so we had been given incorrect papers, but at that moment, I didn’t know, and I couldn’t face him with this news. I couldn’t tell him that I was a failure at school. My father took great pride in.

C2,"Given this story: Vancouver In the last ten years or so hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver in western Canada. To relax in the evening residents stroll down the city streets and if you join them you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step.  The city has attracted a new cosmopolitan mix of people: students, artists, computer scientists, high-tech entrepreneurs and immigrants from Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe. They all come with their unique lifestyles, tastes and traditions. They have helped to make Vancouver a more exciting place to live, but they have also made the city more diverse, creating in the process more and more neighbourhoods that only their own people feel comfortable in. This phenomenon is happening elsewhere around the world. It has given birth to a new type of urban environment known as the ethnic enclave.  An ethnic enclave is an area of a city where people from the same cultural or ethnic background live together and control the social and economic life of that area. They form a distinct community based on shared language, religion, food and other customs. People from different ethnic backgrounds may live in these areas too, but the local culture is strongly dominated by the ethnic majority. The residents of an ethnic enclave often open small businesses and social institutions there, and they hire people from their own community for jobs. People from outside the enclave are often not welcome, and they may even feel intimidated when they visit. Some critics have called ethnic enclaves ""ghettos"", implying that the inhabitants have no connection with the rest of the city and have a negative effect on the host society. They argue that enclaves.

Over the past ten years, lots of people from all over the world have come to live in Vancouver, a city in western Canada. People from many different places, like students, artists, computer experts, business people and immigrants from Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, have made the city more exciting. They each have their own ways of living, things they like and things they do. Because of this, the city has become more diverse. In some parts of the city, people from the same culture or background live together. These are called ""ethnic enclaves"". In these areas, the people speak the same language, share the same religion, like the same food and have other things in common. People who live in these areas often open shops and clubs for themselves and give jobs to other people from the same area. But other people from different cultures might feel uncomfortable in these areas because the local culture is strongly dominated by the ethnic majority. Some people think this is a good thing and others think it is a bad thing.

C2,"Given this story: MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house I learned that opera is in fact only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That’s as it should be of course. Au coeur de son théâtre, le Théâtre du Châtelet présente un large éventail d’œuvres musicales, variétés, danse, spectacles de rue... Les saisons se succèdent, les spectacles se mêlent, les ralentis s’ensuivent, les concerts entrent en scène, chaque été il se produit des représentations gratuites du spectacle. The only thing is, there aren't many English translations and the casts are generally French. This doesn't have to be a negative thing though. It just means you get to learn and experience a whole different kind of theatre! The other major theatre in the city is the Paris Opera. This too puts on many productions, as I have mentioned. One thing I didn’t get to experience this year was the opera season, which starts in early September and runs until late June. It is a time of great musical activity, with many concerts taking place, and it also offers a huge array of classes on all aspects of music and the arts. These include workshops, open masterclasses, and individual lessons in various disciplines such as vocals, composition, and conducting. You can learn how to sing, play an instrument, write a script or direct a play, all right in the heart of the city that never sleeps! This means you can experience music, theatre and dance on.

It’s not really a coincidence; the music really does come first. But that’s the way it should be. The Théâtre du Châtelet presents a wide range of musical works, variety shows, dance and street performances. The seasons change, the shows mix, and concerts start, with free shows in the summer. You know, even though most of what's on is in French and it might be hard to understand, it's a great chance to experience a whole different type of theatre. The other main theatre in the city, the Paris Opera, puts on numerous shows too. However, I missed the opera season this year. This season, full of music and theatre, begins in early September and runs until late June. There are lots of concerts and also classes on music and the arts. These include workshops, masterclasses, and individual lessons on singing, playing instruments, writing scripts or directing plays. No matter where you're from or what language you speak, you can experience music, theatre and dance in the city that never sleeps. So always keep this in mind. Opera comes first in music, and theatre is its second act.

C2,"Given this story: BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology 'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest.  This is where the analogy falls apart. For the seed sower uses a technique to produce growth and the planter has a precise objective of sowing. Broadcasting, the other hand, as a technology involves a wide spectrum of activities that are aimed at a general audience of unspecified targets. The broadcasting medium has an audience, but no real aim. In the days of traditional television the audiences were generally predictable. Young people, mature adults and family viewers. The old model of television broadcasting was a very predictable business. Today, audiences have changed enormously. TV has changed enormously.  Technology is now at the core of this transformation. But what is technology? It is the application of science and knowledge to meet practical human needs. The development of technology in broadcasting started with the birth of television and radio. The early pioneers of broadcasting, starting with Marconi and later by other innovators, recognized that technology could be used to communicate in new ways with the public. The earliest innovations required large, complicated and expensive apparatus. It was the work of pioneers like John Logie Baird to develop the television technology, and the engineers who developed the FM system that allowed radio broadcasting to expand beyond AM sound. In television we moved from black and white to color, from standard to hi-definition. In radio, the technology developed to create high fidelity sound and.

Broadcasting got its name from sowing seeds. It's a word that's an agricultural metaphor, which means it's about growing things. But broadcasting, as a technology, is different. It involves a wide range of activities aimed at an unknown audience. For traditional TV, the viewers were clear: young, old, and families. But the industry has changed. Technology has taken over and is at the core of it all. 

Technology is the combination of science and knowledge for practical purposes. In the beginning, with the invention of TV and radio, the pioneers recognized its potential. Early equipment was large, complicated and expensive. However, engineers and inventors like John Logie Baird worked to create simpler, more advanced technology. This brought about improvements like color TV and hi-definition. But in radio, progress included high-fidelity sound. So, even though technology has transformed the industry, broadcasting still aims to reach an audience, though now it's not predictable. Broadcasting remains about sowing seeds, but for a more diverse and unpredictable audience.

C2,"Given this story: Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941 despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst its alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. Citizen Kane is considered one of the greatest movies of all time for a number of reasons. One of those reasons is the film’s structure and how its unveils its secrets to the audience. This is what makes Citizen Kane so compelling and enjoyable. Citizen Kane tells the story of a newspaper man, Charles Foster Kane, who built a media empire. His obsession with acquiring the news-ticker symbol of Rosebud at the end of the film turns out to be a clue to a very personal story of longing and unfulfilled wishes. The unraveling of this story is what makes this movie a classic. The movie Citizen Kane was the first film I can remember seeing. I remember not really knowing what was going on, not knowing any of the story lines, and not even knowing why it was a great movie. I am not sure I would call myself a huge fan of classic movies, but if I had to say yes or no to whether I would watch Citizen Kane again, I would say yes. I can remember, after having watched the film, reading the newspaper that accompanied the program. It was full of very strange pictures of people that I had never heard of, but seemed to be somehow related to the movie. I did not know what was going on but found this really interesting.

C2,"Given this story: England’s breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature.  It is generally believed that the introduction of the potato crop from South America in the 16^{th} century had a significant impact on the traditional English diet as it meant that people were able to have larger and more filling breakfasts. Prior to this, the idea of a substantial hot breakfast was unheard of, however, as demand for breakfast food grew, new ingredients and methods to produce more filling foods were developed. A large English breakfast is now one of the most well-known meals across the globe and it's the perfect way to start the day. British people enjoy a diverse range of ingredients at breakfast, from grilled kippers to fried bread to sausages, bacon and eggs. You'll find these dishes served in homes and cafes, including greasy spoons, cafes that have been serving up traditional British breakfasts for decades. What makes a ‘Full English’? The traditional English breakfast, sometimes referred to as a ‘full English’, is said to be a perfect way to start the day. But what’s included in it? Well, it differs from region to region and from family to family. The British Breakfast Survey in 2007 found that the most popular items included scrambled eggs (82%), toast (82%), baked beans (64%), bacon (62%),.

Once upon a time, it wasn’t that important to have a good breakfast in England. It was like that for a long time in history. But then, when the people found out that eating breakfast was very good for them, everything changed. A long time ago, in the 16th century, people in England didn’t really have a filling and substantial breakfast because they didn’t have the right kind of food. Then, in the 16th century, they found out about the potato crop from South America and suddenly they had the chance to eat a proper and filling breakfast. Because of this, they came up with more and more new ingredients for breakfast. Today, people in England enjoy a tasty breakfast with different kinds of food like grilled kippers, fried bread, sausages, bacon, and eggs. 

Now, let’s talk about the ‘Full English’. It is a traditional English breakfast that people enjoy very much, especially at the beginning of the day. It’s true that the Full English is different from one place to another and one family to another but one thing is sure: it’s a perfect way to start the day. In 2007, some people decided to make a survey to find out what is the most popular thing in the Full English. The answers were quite clear.
