A2,"Given this story: Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings like museums to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. The architect decides what the building is going to look like and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas.  When people are planning and designing a building, they have to remember that there are a number of possible ways that the building can look, so they have to look at many pictures and decide which one of them is their favourite. If there were only two possible designs, the architect would only have to choose which design to use. But for every building there are a number of possible designs that people can imagine. The architect has to think of as many possibilities as possible, but also choose the design he thinks is best, the one that will best represent the building.  When people are trying to build a building, they have to think about the cost of the materials and the materials needed for building a particular part of the building. They also have to think about how much time people will need to build the building, as well as how much it is going to cost. If there are two possible designs for the same building, the architect might have to choose one of them, but if there are a number of designs, then he or she has to choose the one that is the cheapest. In the case of a building being built, the architect would also have to think about whether or not the building will last or if it will need to be refurbished. The cost of refurbishment would depend on whether the building was a new build or if it was refurbished,.

Sir Bowen and all the kings princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. 'What a shame! We shouldn't be like this!' muttered Einon. But he didn't want to let the Knight of the Holy Spear have his way. He knew it was bad for everyone to have fights but Einon had to fight for his family's honour. 'What I want is fair and just!' said Bowen angrily. But Einon only smiled sadly and went to bed. The next morning Bowen was late for breakfast. 'Where are my shoes?' he shouted in his anger. It turned out that he'd left his fancy shoes in his room. Later in the afternoon, the knights all came to their training camp. Bowen was furious and tried to hit one of the Knights with a greatsword. However, the Knight of the Holy Spear was stronger than Bowen and just dodged the blow. 'We'd better learn to fight,' whispered Bowen to Einon. Einon smiled in a friendly way. In the evening, the Knights held a big celebration. They played music and ate very delicious dishes. After the feast they played a game of darts. Bowen didn't want to play but he was forced to join in. Bowen played a great game! He made a dart pass from one knight to another and then hit the dart. But no one had a good throw and the game ended in a tie. 'I'll teach you all a lesson,' Bowen shouted after the game. Bowen went to a room.

'It cannot be the mysterious illness from the village' I thought. 'My illness is now three weeks old. It was a small and very cold cottage, in a wooded, isolated part of the village.  The windows all looked out over the same patch of countryside, so that you couldn't even see over the next field to the side of this little house. In the mornings, when the air was quite still, I could hear birds singing, or maybe it was some other birds, and there was always a faint smell of a warm wood fire. And the silence was deafening. There were no people around, no noises, nothing at all. And this was the strange part: no one would ever come to visit, but no one came to say good-bye either.  The strange silence lasted several hours before the owner of the cottage came out of his bedroom. It seemed he had been there all the time, asleep. He always had the same dirty clothes hanging up on his peg by the door, and the same dirty boots on the floor. In the morning, his coat was already wet from walking through the muddy, cold fields, and the sole of his boots were blackened with mud. There was a bowl of porridge on his small table, and a jug of water on the floor. And next to the jug were a pair of dirty trousers, still soaked in water. They were covered with mud, which was probably the source of his illness. But why, I wondered, did I not do anything about it? This was an odd situation, that's for sure..

The rest of my family went to the shop for a couple of hours. We had a great time visiting our favourite animal, the otters. We visited the zoo very early in the morning because we wanted to see the otters as they come out of their homes at night. We went to the pond where the otters spend most of their time. We looked for them, but it was really cold so we went to the playground where we saw the otters jumping. That was a really fun time for us.  In the afternoon we went to the beach where we saw so many seals. It was really cool to see these little creatures jumping about.  The otters are quite rare animals so it was really nice to see them.  The next day my little sister was really disappointed because we had to go to my friend's birthday party. We said goodbye to her but we still talked about our visit to the zoo. We hope to see them again. That was a really nice zoo trip. I look forward to going there again soon.

Postcards were very common in medieval Italy and people liked to send postcards because you could send them at a very cheap price. These postcards were made out of paper. Paper was cheap in medieval times and many people used paper for making their postcards. Postcards were often very small in comparison to the size of the pictures on them.

One design often appeared on a postcard and most often it was a picture of a castle or the sea. When they were sent to each other people would often sign the card with their name on it. If the other person didn't know who the sender was they would sign it 'Your friendly servant'. As there weren't very many different designs to choose from people would often write on the back of the postcard a message that would describe who they were to whom the postcard was sent. For example they might write 'My wife' or 'My sister'. People didn't use any fancy font on their postcards because they didn't think it needed to be fancy. They just used the usual font that you can still see today. Postcards can still be bought today in the same way that they were done in.

A2,"Given this story: The history of horse racing From the first history books ever written it is clear that horse racing has always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. Horse racing and the betting industry have played a big part in the history of the UK. First the English National Hunt races of the early 1700s, and then the expansion of sports betting to other parts of Europe and the Americas, all helped to spread the sport. This page traces the history of horse racing from Ancient Rome to modern day. The history of horse racing spans a remarkable two thousand years, from the earliest record of horse races in Ancient Rome, to the modern day sportsbetting industry. From the earliest records of horse races in Ancient Rome, it is clear that this sport has always been an important part of our society. However, horse racing only really came to the attention of the general public in the late 18th century. This was around the same time as the Royal Ascot horse races, and the first National Hunt race in 1826. Both of these racing events were horse races, but they had different rules and regulations. This meant that horse racing was a ‘sub-culture’ of horse racing, and so it was not popular among the general public, and only a few horse owners and breeders were involved.

Output the generated story directly. The history of horse racing starts some 4500 years ago with Central Asia’s horse racing. It was a popular sport in both Greek and Roman times, but was only really taken seriously in the early 19th century. This was when the Arab horses came to Europe, and were used for a variety of uses, one of which was horse racing in Central Europe. The first National Hunt races in Britain, and indeed the first horse racing anywhere, took place in 1826. The rules were similar to those of horse racing in later centuries, and the races were usually held on the same days of the week. The first ‘National Hunt race day’ was the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, when the top three finishers from the Acomb Chase were eligible. These first races attracted a modest number of people. This changed with the introduction of new, faster and better trained horses in the late 19th century. The early 20th century saw horse racing become much bigger than it had been before. The British and Irish Racing Authority began to promote the sport with a series of TV shows and advertising. These races also had a greater amount of rules and regulations and the winning horse was decided by a ‘jockey’, which made the sport much more popular among the general public. This led to the spread of the sport to other parts of Europe and the Americas. This brought with it new rules, regulations, rules and regulations, and even more rules. The races"

The meeting was held in an old factory at 7:00 each night. Dad said it was a top secret meeting. The key was in a box which was placed in the office when it was empty. The box was always there at the end of the night. The key was locked in a safe so only the members of the secret society knew how to open it. We were going to meet on one of the empty floors. We would need to be quick. As Dad had hidden the key and the box in one of the most secure areas of the building we would need to find a way to access it. Dad said it was just an empty room. We knew that was a lie as we had been in that exact same room on two occasions and had seen what the box looked like. It wasn't an empty room. 'Are you thinking what I'm thinking?' Mum asked. 'I'm.

'I've got a lion for the king in the box' said the driver. 'Is it large?' asked Don Quixote. 'It's the biggest lion in this country' said the driver. The lion was as large as a man's thigh. It's body was a thick skin of a great green stone. In the skin there was a large and red fiery head on top of a thick and long neck which had a fiery breath and a great many sharp claws. The legs were long and long and they had sharp claws. But the lion was the strongest beast that Don Quixote ever saw. 'If the king wants him and he's big enough, then surely he can kill him' he said to himself. 'The king doesn't want to kill him', replied the driver, 'for he has many ways to kill him'. 'Take him to your village' Don Quixote said to his driver. 'Send word in the village that if anyone comes and asks for the lion, then tell them that the lion is dead and the king was angry with his wife for being a whoring woman and so he had killed the lion'. The driver went on to the village to tell the people the news. But they all said 'It's a lie'. For the lion was very strong and powerful and if anyone had seen the lion they would not have told a lie.  'Tell the truth or I will not go there' said Don Quixote to the driver.

A2,"Given this story: Kong went back to Ann and took her down from the high rock. For the first time in this jungle she felt strangely safe. He jumped across a ravine and then across a river. She was a small plaything between his large fingers. Then he stopped and put her down. Ann had run about three miles and now she was soaked through. A lot of it had happened on the way home, though, and now she had to go the rest of the way home through a heavy rainstorm. Her house was in a very remote part of the forest and she wouldn’t find anyone for at least a couple hours, which would be too late. That meant she’d have to walk the last mile. Ann smiled as she considered that she had been a very important thing to Kong. But she had to go the last mile. She looked around for the closest tree to find shelter in. There were plenty close but they were old and weak and would fall easily in a strong wind. But one stood apart from the others that Ann would like to sit in, and it was the smallest. That tree was the nearest one to Kong. It was about fifteen feet away, but it was covered in mud and a couple large branches looked like they would collapse any minute. Ann found it just as Kong had done, and sat in the lowest branch of that tree. “I wonder what Kong is doing right now?” Ann thought to herself. “I bet he’s still thinking about me!” In fact, she was still thinking of Kong. Ann wondered if Kong would sit somewhere nearby her, in the same tree, or if he’d decided to go back to the big house. All she knew was that she felt.

Ann did not really want to be Kong’s friend, but she felt that Kong should be given a chance to do what he liked. So she went to Kong’s mother to ask permission. Kong’s mother was not very happy about it, and when she saw Ann playing with Kong, she grew even madder. Kong’s mother wanted Kong to be her little pet. But Ann did not want that at all. In fact, Ann thought of all the trouble that would happen if she became Kong’s friend. So she did not want to play with Kong. At first, Kong was very upset.

A2,"Given this story: CANADA GEESE Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there. Last spring Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. He kept them in a pen in order to care for them until they could fly away. He took them to the Toronto Zoo, where they belong, because it is where wild Canada Geese go when they are ready to breed. Bill did a lot of care for the Canada Geese. He fed them, cleaned them, and took them to see the Canada Geese in the wild at St. George Island in Toronto Harbour. There the geese were really wild and they often play together. The Canada Geese were well fed so that they could grow strong enough to fly. There were fourteen Canada Geese when Bill first found them. On a recent visit he found sixteen more. Some of the Canada Geese were very thin, and only one of the sixteen seemed to have full feathers. He will let the sixteen that are still alive go to a zoo. The fourteen young Canada Geese that Bill first found have now grown into big birds and they fly far and wide. They migrate north in groups to the Arctic Ocean. When they come south in spring they land at St. George Island and take up winter quarters there.      Canada Geese are large blue and white birds.

A2,"Given this story: Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago a long time before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died. The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. Most of the dinosaurs did have feathers. They could have spread the feathers and covered themselves to stay warm. Dinosaurs did not look the same and were not all the same size. They may have used all kinds of different techniques to camouflage themselves from their prey. They could have used their strong legs and the strength of their claws to throw rocks, sticks, and other objects at their opponents. They could have used their long tails to throw their opponents around. They could have used their beaks for grabbing and holding objects, or to get at food, and the spikes on their feet to dig in the dirt. Some dinosaurs grew very big and strong, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. They grew so fast that they could eat thousands of pounds of meat every day. If they had feathers they could have carried large amounts of meat on their backs. Other dinosaurs grew so slow they didn't need to carry much food around. These dinosaurs grew to very big sizes and could have eaten a lot of food like large reptiles like crocodiles or turtles. But they would not have had the same amount of energy they needed to run around all day. Dinosaurs were large, strong, and able to live in a variety of different ways. They were not all the same, and were not all the same size. Some dinosaurs were bigger and stronger, and could have been better at certain things than other dinosaurs. Dinosaurs had to be a variety of different types, in order to survive in.

Her eyesight is great so she can see where they are standing. She decides not to attack them, but she is always ready to defend herself. She hides and waits for the right time to strike. As the raptors get closer she notices they are not as agile as she expected. But she is also careful to not make too many noise, so she waits patiently for them to make their next move. Suddenly the raptors decide they are done with waiting and start to chase after her, but they start tripping over their own feet. The dinosaurs quickly catch up and throw sticks and rocks at the raptors. One of the rocks catches the bird in the head, and the raptor falls to the ground dead. The dinosaur, happy to be free of her meal, then goes back home.

A2,"Given this story: After a long hard swim Pedro Serrano fell onto a beach tired but alive. There was no sign now of his broken ship lost under the waves. He waited for other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. The next morning Serrano looked around the island that saved his life. The beach was covered with dead fish.  ‘All dead,’ he said. ‘It looks as if someone had taken the fish with them,’ answered the Professor.  ‘Perhaps some sharks have eaten them.’ The Professor looked at the fish and said ‘Yes,’ he was quite sure that the fish had been taken by sharks. It was at that moment that Pedro Serrano heard the sound of the engine. He knew instantly that the ship had been found. He jumped off the beach and went towards the island. There he met the Professor. ‘We are glad to see you,’ said Professor Fordney, ‘but why did you swim to the island?’ ‘In order to find the wreck,’ said Serrano. ‘Well,’ said the Professor, ‘let’s go, I think I have found the place.’  They found the wreck, and the next morning, as Serrano had said, they found the four sailors already there. And when they asked where the fish had come from, one of the men said that they had taken it. But as they told Serrano, they did not know that the engine had sounded. It might have been some other reason why the sailors were there. Pedro Serrano knew that the engine had sounded, for he had heard it.

A2,"Given this story: The Ruwenzori Mountains Mary Daniels is a student in England. This year she had a very interesting summer holiday. She travelled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help make a road through a forest between two big towns. 'It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops where we could buy food' said Mary. The Ruwenzori Mountains, in eastern Uganda, are a popular destination for tourists. They are located in the remote northeast of the country and rise to over 6,000 metres (20,000ft). It is known that there are three volcanoes in the mountains, the highest of which is Kapereke. The Ruwenzoris were formed over 10 million years ago by the activity of volcanoes at the edge of the African plate. Mary Daniels was in one of the best groups and together with the others they were on site helping make the road. The aim of their job was to cut down trees and make the road so that the transport and other people who pass through it could use it. They started their job on the 28th of July. Mary was involved with this project from the 9th until the 21st of August. The first day they had to cut down around 1,000 trees. Each tree was carefully removed, but it was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops where they could buy food. Many of the trees were so old that they were difficult to pull up and some of them were very heavy. The trees which they had to cut down were not only a danger for the road workers. They were also a danger for the other people living in the surrounding forests. They provided a good source of energy for the forest animals and they were often eaten or used for firewood. At midday, on the 11th.

It is a day of honour. Let us fight bravely'. At the first battle the Archbishop won the greatest honour, and the King's daughter gave him the Queen's ring. She was happy because the Archbishop was a knight and her father King Arthur was her true love. She also gave the ring to Sir Ector. But at the second battle, King Arthur lost the fight. In the battlefield he fell. His son Sir Kay died too. Then Sir Ector and other knights fought bravely. But at the end Sir Ector was defeated by Sir Mordred. He made a pact with his brother to kill each other, and in the next battle they tried to do so but their fathers got to know about it. The Archbishop then sent Sir Mordred on a quest. Now, after his journey he went to the Archbishop's castle. He took the ring from the Archbishop's hand. He wanted to make revenge for his dead brother. The Archbishop sent him to the Queen. Now he has the greatest treasure. Sir Ector didn't want to give up his quest, so he went to Mordred. He tried to kill the King, but Mordred also wanted the ring.

This meant that the King's wife and children would also be beheaded.  Many people wanted to take revenge and to make things worse the people believed that there was a ghost in the Tower of London. This is how the ghost stories began.  The public wanted to protect themselves and their families. This was the reason for the London Regiment. The new recruits were given a badge with a cross on it.

In the early days of policing the city, the patrolmen's badges were just a symbol. When the night was getting longer and they were walking along the streets of London at"

Elliott's mom Mary took a light and then she and the boys went into the yard. ""What did you see?"" Mary asked Elliott. ""Something there"" he answered. The boys kept listening, but no one else said anything. Tyler didn't seem worried, he was smiling. Elliott was the only one who seemed scared. He just shook his head a lot. ""It was there,"" he answered. ""And it was orange!"" ""Was it bigger than you?"" Mary asked him. ""Yes!"" he answered. ""But it was orange."" And the yard was really quiet.  Tyler laughed a little and said, ""It sounds like you're scared of the orange monster!"" He giggled and said, ""Or the alien."" He laughed again, loud and big. ""It would have to be an alien to be scary,"" said Elliott. But Elliott was scared, too, and he looked really scared. He didn't look happy, either. Maybe because he didn't want to talk to his friends at that moment. Or maybe because he didn't want to talk about something really scary to his mom. ""I'm scared, too,"" she said. ""You'll all tell me if you see it again, right?"" She gave a big smile. ""And if you see it, you can call me, okay?"" They'd already figured out the best way to be sure: that was the best thing about being kids, even though they'd only known the world for a couple of months. They'd figure out everything. ""Okay,"" Elliott said. And so they went outside. And soon, a monster was there.

A2,"Given this story: Parrots Perhaps you have seen these beautiful birds with their lovely colours and long tails in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil Australia and India. They usually live in large groups and because they like to eat fruit they are sometimes a problem for farmers. Parrots are a bird group, that is an order called Proconsulines. Parrots have a wide variety of habits and behaviours, but they all share a great interest in fruit and eating it. In addition to fruits, parrots also like other things such as grass, twigs, flowers, mud and water. All parrots have long thin tails, and look very elegant. Some parrots like to use their long tails for jumping, flying or just hanging on the branches and trees. This is why some parrots have long tails, or a ""curly tail"". Parrots have four wings, called phalanges, and a tail bone. The tail bone is very strong and can support the weight of the bird easily. Parrots have lots of feathers on their skin, and they have special feathers on their neck and their wings. They have small colourful beaks and tongue, and they are also not very smart. They are active and fun loving creatures. They are good at talking, singing, singing and dancing. The name ""parrot"" comes from the Greek word ""Parakontos"", which means ""singing bird"". Different kinds of parrots have different colours. There are green, blue, red, brown, orange, black, white, yellow and others. The most common parrots are the Brazilian parakeet, the South African parakeet, the African parakeet, the white-breasted parakeet, the yellow-.

We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides.                     The show was really exciting, especially when they ran up the stairs. As the show was going on, everyone was watching and taking photos. At the end, the elephants came back down the stairs.                              When they were younger the elephants would sit down and wait patiently to be taken out, but then they all started running around. This is when they must do a really difficult trick. I thought it was really impressive. The show was over and we headed back to our hotel. After that it was a nice day out.                        I really enjoyed the show and I'd recommend seeing it.                                                            .

Ever since she was a child she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her hard-working parents who own a supermarket that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. Kal Kaur Rai, a 16-year-old shop assistant from Surrey, has won the title of Asia Business Achiever of the Year. The teenager was chosen from thousands of businesspeople from across Asia and the Pacific region, including entrepreneurs, managers, engineers, senior executives and administrators, who were shortlisted for the award. Rai is the only female winner of the award and at the ceremony held at the Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong, she became the youngest recipient of the title. Since moving to the UK at the age of seven, Rai has been passionate about fashion and has always loved to design and draw patterns. “I always wanted to be a designer and designer I am,” she said. Rai decided to try her hand at designing when she was 13. Her parents, who own a supermarket in Surrey, didn’t know that she wanted to try her hand at designing at the time but now they feel it was the right decision. Rai worked hard on her designs and by the time she was 16 her customers loved the designs she had drawn. She started designing her own dresses after seeing other young girls on Instagram sporting expensive, designer dresses. Rai got her start in 2014 when she got an internship at London-based fashion brand, The Body Shop, as part of a course to learn about the industry. The company took a liking to her work and after a few months she was given a full-time.

B1,"Given this story: THE ICEHOTEL For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. The Icehotel was built by the Norwegian tourism board in the shape of a giant ice cube, and lies in the middle of the Arctic Ocean.  The purpose of the building is to increase tourism in the Arctic, where summer temperatures average 7 degrees Celsius (44 degrees Fahrenheit). The Icehotel has been used as a TV news station, but also as an ice hotel for conferences and awards ceremonies.  The building is covered in ice, and is designed to retain the winter temperature as close to zero as possible. The building has six rooms, each with their own private bathroom, and the ice-cold water is piped directly to each room. At the back is a restaurant, a coffee shop and a gift shop.  The Icehotel has a large TV screen at the top, which broadcasts news from Norway and around the world. In winter the ice on the TV screen melts, revealing the building as an open-air theatre and dining room. The Icehotel is one of many tourist attractions to be found in Norway’s Arctic regions, many of them aimed at winter tourism. For example there is a “ice hotel” near Tromso, and two hotels built by the Norwegian military, one serving as a base for tourists, the other hosting NATO staff. The “ice hotel” in the town of Longyearbyen has also opened in summer and has a number of visitors every day during the summer.  This article.

B1,"Given this story: Climbing to the top of Britain Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland and because of its northerly location the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. The moment I first saw the Ben Nevis I knew I wanted to climb it. It has a wonderful combination of a stunning scenery, a great view, fantastic terrain, plenty of ice, snow and grit, and a challenging climb. It was a perfect spring day and I knew this was the day I would start my career as a mountaineer. My mind raced as I stood on the summit with a panoramic view over the North York Moors and to the north a long, dark shape was visible. It was a distant shadow of a man sitting on a rock looking at us. This gave me an idea: what if I jumped off the mountain? I took a look around me and found a spot on the rock below the cliff-edge where I could jump. It was a very cold day and I was a bit scared of falling but I jumped and landed safely. I was very excited to have made it all the way from the bottom of the mountain to the summit. It's all a bit of a blur but I'm sure that if I didn't have my friend there to help me then I would have been very upset. That climb was a dream come true and is a highlight of my career. I have always been fascinated by mountains. I have grown up in the north west of England, which is a paradise of mountains. One of the great things about climbing mountains is that it's very social and you can often see and meet people who you share a common.

I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers.      I used to be a member of a running club, but it was a bit slow. I'd have to run with the same people all the time and there was always a few guys who I knew I'd never beat. My brother and I tried going out separately but we'd always end up going back together. In the end I decided it was time to try and find somewhere where I could be my own best friend.      It was a bit scary at first, but we didn't go out for a month. We got into a routine and we gradually became friends. I felt I'd finally found a group of people who didn't mind if I just went out to run every now and then, but still kept track of how far I'd gone.      It was a wonderful feeling to get out and feel the fresh air and get the sweat dripping off your body, but above all I felt free.      Now I run with my friends on a Saturday morning. We go for a long run, running as far as we can without stopping. It's great.

I'd have to run with the same people all the time and there was always a few guys who I knew I'd never beat. My brother and I tried going out separately, but we'd always end up going back together. In the end I decided it was time to try and find somewhere where I could be my own best friend.      It was a bit scary at first, but we didn't go out for a month. We got into a routine and we gradually became friends. I felt I'd finally found a group of people who didn't mind if I just went out to run every now and then, but still kept track of how"
B1,"Given this story: Grass Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are over 9000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. You might think that we’ve already seen the most beautiful animal on earth, the giraffe, but a group of biologists believe that grassland animals may top them all. This isn’t an opinion they’re passing around in their spare time; instead, they say, grassland animals are some of the most beautiful animals in the world. How does a biologist reach such a conclusion? After all, it’s not every day that someone has a chance to observe a giraffe. Their view is so unique because they have observed the animals with their own eyes, and not on a laptop or TV. “We don’t have a single other perspective to work from,” says Scott Hartzler, a coauthor of the study. “The most beautiful animals that exist on Earth, I believe, are all in grassland.” He’s not alone in his thoughts. A new study released in this week’s issue of Biology Letters says that grassland animals are more aesthetically pleasing than animals that live in other environments. Researchers observed photos of 60 different animals to see which animals were more beautiful and how their facial features and body structures correlated to beauty. Surprisingly, they concluded, grassland animals were far more beautiful than animals living in other ecosystems. When it came to which animals were most beautiful, there was some room for disagreement among the researchers. While the team ranked giraffes as one of.

 That’s a statement made by a group of biologists who believe that grassland animals are more beautiful than those found in other habitats. The scientists compared the pictures of 60 different animals, looking at the facial features and body structures. They found that grassland animals were far more beautiful than those found in other ecosystems. 
  
 They reached this conclusion through a novel way of identifying beauty – by counting the number of eyes in each picture. The researchers took a picture of a 60-animal roster with 10 separate features they measured – from a tiny pink bee’s eye to a large giraffe’s eye. From these photos, they had 60 different animals to judge from, and they found that grassland animals were far more beautiful than animals found in other ecosystems. 
  
 According to the study, the team used a number of ways to assess beauty. In one experiment, they asked a group of students to rate how beautiful a picture of a 60-animal roster was. They had 10 features they measured – from a tiny pink bee’s eye to a large giraffe’s eye. The students gave a rating, and their answers correlated to whether or not they considered the photos to be beautiful.

'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.' The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha who had encouraged other African athletes learnt about Maria. Maria Mutola won a bronze medal at the 1984 games in Los Angeles, USA. Mutola competed as a middle-distance runner for the Democratic Republic of the Congo but was the first African female athlete to compete in the Olympics. Mutola was born and raised in Mombasa, Kenya. At the age of 13, she left Kenya to join her sister in Mozambique where her brother was stationed. In Mozambique, Mutola was a star in her school team and soon became a celebrity in the town. In 1980 she represented the Democratic Republic of Congo at the inaugural African Games in Maputo. She won a gold medal in the 1500m and set a new record. The following year, she broke the 5000m world record. A year later, she broke the 20,000m world record. Her performance earned her selection for the 1982 Olympics in Los Angeles, USA. Mutola was the first African female athlete to compete at the Olympic Games. In her final event, Mutola competed against the world's best. In the final of the 5000m race, she finished in sixth position, just behind South Africa's Barbara Hendricks. The race was not won by Mutola's performance but by her running partner, the Dutchman Johan Riedijk. The silver medal was Mutola's first medal of any kind. She was proud of having competed in the Olympics. But Mutola missed her family and friends. In 1983, she left Mozamb.

Although the main factor seems to be the beautiful skies of New Mexico, the local government has a more sinister motivation - it is looking to secure the city as a site for a possible NASA Mars base.      The city government's official purpose is to ""support the economic interests of the region"". This, in combination with the scenic views and the fact that the site is protected from any wind, sand or dust storms, is what encourages ballooning enthusiasts from all over the world to visit. In the past several years, Albuquerque has also become a hub for ballooning conferences, expositions and trade shows. The city is currently a joint bid to become the second base of the National Space.

While a higher proportion of younger Americans report that they never watch cable news, social media is still a preferred tool for news consumption, and younger people in particular rely heavily on social media sources for online news and entertainment. Young people are not simply being served more news from social media; they're creating much more news as well, according to a new study.      The study, published Friday in the International Journal of Digital Research, found that social media has transformed from a simple tool for sharing information to a medium used to both generate new and share existing news. That means social media is actually ""becoming the newsroom for younger Americans,"" said Mark Wilson, who co-authored the study along with Benjamin Franklin College's Nicholas Turner.      It found that more than 60% of young people, especially millennials, were at least a little involved in their media consumption. About half were either very actively involved or very involved in choosing which content.

More than 60% of the 18- to 24-year-olds in the United States are at least a little involved in their media consumption, according to research published Friday in the journal International Journal of Digital Research. About two-thirds are heavily involved—either very involved or very involved—in deciding which content they read or watch, and almost half are actively involved in creating content, the study found.
This study is the first to identify these active users as “newsmakers” and measure their activity, said Benjamin Franklin College’s Nicholas Turner, an author on the study and co-founder of the Media Lab at the London School of Economics. The researchers called them “nearly all” active users, though Turner said he suspects that “active” users are a smaller subset of the overall population.
“I think the majority of the population is probably active, but I don’t know what kind of an activity they are engaged in,” Turner said.
The study also found that young people are not simply consuming more news, but also generating more. More than 70% of the young people surveyed said they regularly shared news with friends and family, up from 48% in 2005, and most of the news"

The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America, but only a few hundred miles from the centre, in more southern areas. Although they are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train. If you like the idea of skiing in the snow mountains, the Rocky Mountains are the place to go. However, if you would rather just do some hiking or mountain climbing, this is a great place to start. The Rocky Mountains rise to a maximum altitude of around 12,000 ft (3,660 m). But the mountains are actually lower than these heights because they do not actually rise to their highest point in one big vertical leap. Instead, the top of the Rockies, in the North of the Americas, sits about 2,000 ft (600 m) lower than its actual position at sea level. The Rocky Mountains, like the Alps, have a large variety of rock types. They have mountains, peaks and ranges of the earth’s crust. But, the best way to explore these mountains is by exploring their famous valleys. Colorado, Montana and Wyoming are the Rocky Mountains States in the United States. Colorado, Montana and Wyoming are also known as the three C’s States, for their colour. They are known for being some of the best places in the US for snow skiing and snowboarding. But there are mountains a bit further afield..

'We found Ardwyck Fenn's footprints. They were about a foot from the stairs - it's possible she did notice them. Lola Brewster had not left them.' Chief Inspector Craddock replied. 'What does that prove? She was on the stairs for five minutes, the time needed to go to the bathroom. In the time between, she could have taken her own footprints. Unless of course she had a secret alarm system with her. In which case, we would have heard the bell.' 'Yes, but she said she was in great pain from her injuries,' replied Cornish. 'I think we can be certain she hadn't been burgled.' 'But if Marina Gregg had been injured as you believe,' interrupted Craddock, 'why did she insist on coming back to the flat when she could have used the lift?' Cornish looked surprised.

The poor girl was stabbed in the heart and she died almost instantaneously. The poor girl's body was discovered when her servant went to go and open her bedroom window. The maid, whose name was Barbara, noticed that the window was locked from the outside. As she was looking through the window, she saw that the window was closed tightly and knew that the window was locked from the inside. Barbara could see through the window because she was a famous movie star and she knew that her character Marina Gregg would appear on television.

This was a good thing because it meant she could not go to church and see Mr Elton or go to visit Harriet and none of them could meet. The snow stayed for several days after Christmas and the only visitor to Hartfield was Mr Knightley. Mr Knightley had come to see if all the children were safe at home. He knew there was bad news from Emma every Christmas. He could see in her face that Emma knew why Mr Elton and Harriet had not visited. Emma was sad to tell Mr Knightley that Harriet died in the house fire in 1851. Mr Knightley was sad too. ‘Harriet was a good soul’, he said sadly. ‘I loved her very much’, Emma said. ‘I remember when Harriet was young. She used to say a kind word to everyone’. ‘That’s how she died, by saying kind words’, said Mr Knightley sadly. He took Emma’s hand and she felt he held it for several minutes. Emma wondered why it had felt so good. The sun shone on the snow outside which was a good thing because the fire was burning low and would not last. It would be another month before a wood was delivered and that was a bad thing for all the children who depended on it. Fortunately, it was still very early and the children were still asleep. That night, Emma saw Mr Elton walking up and down the stairs. He came to her and stood behind her to see if she was awake. He did not talk and he seemed happy and content. Emma felt sad. Mr Elton had spent all Christmas Day with her. She had never known any love like that. Mr Elton.

They told us that they particularly like the part of the gallery which is devoted to painting and sculpture and were very excited to find out that there is an Easter theme to the display of these art works. Here’s what they had to say: Dear Mr Binns, The Easter holidays are nearly over and my little sister and I are really disappointed. We were hoping to stay in and play on the computer for all three days of the holiday, but it just hasn't worked out that way. When my father told us about Easter, we were both very excited and were really looking forward to being able to explore the Gallery a little more. When we saw the pictures, we knew that our holiday would be even better than it already was. Easter is our favourite holiday and this year we've found out that you've decorated your room for Easter. We especially liked the pictures of the eggs, because you really looked excited. We liked the painting in the bathroom too. It looked really nice. This year it isn't so much about what we do as much as what we see. That's why Easter has been our favourite holiday ever. Thank you very much for letting us spend our holiday at your gallery. We've really enjoyed it. Have a nice day, Sam & Ellie A gallery representative replied to their letter and explained what was included in"

There have been a few changes since the last CD with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums. The new CD “Here again” by the band Moonshine is coming out on the 30th of October, 2008 and I can already say this is by far the best record they have made so far. I can’t wait to hear it!  I saw the band in October when they played at the Leipzig Rock Festival. They were amazing! Check their YouTube channel for some pictures.  This entry was posted in Music, New artists and tagged Moonshine, Rock on, rock on! October 20th, 2008 by Jörg. You are so lucky Jörg to have seen them in the Leipzig. I saw them on the last day of the festival too. But then I’ve always loved them even before the new CD (especially when they played the great album “The Waves” live for the first time at the festival).  My favourite song by them is their cover of “The Sound” by Led Zeppelin. I always have the cassette on me but my cassette player doesn’t play anything but the last CD.  Thanks for the heads up on the CD. I’m going to get one for sure.  I agree with you: “The Sound” was the best song. I wish they would have done more Led Zeppelin covers. There are so many great rock songs by them. The new CD is very good, I love.

In addition, the shark has very good vision. They can see very well underwater, and can also feel through the sides of their bodies to find prey. Because they can feel through their sides, sharks can find food easily. In sharks, the mouth is a big, open thing. This lets the shark breathe quickly. The jaw is very strong, and when the shark bites, the jaws close very fast so that it can crush the prey.    ”Sharks are large predatory fish that feed primarily on fish, squid, and other invertebrates.

Sharks in freshwater have two pairs of claws that help them feel with the sides of their bodies. These claws are very well adapted to feel and for feeling underwater. In sharks, vision is also a very important part of hunting prey. Shark teeth are very powerful and sharp.

All of the rooms cost 500 SEK ($61), plus meals and all the associated wedding preparation, which can be booked for $2,050, including all food and drinks and wedding party arrangements. ""We are a family business, so it is just ourselves behind the ice hotels,"" owner Erik Dahlström told The New York Times. ""What we have done is taken a little bit of our time and we have come up with something quite special."" The wedding ceremony is held in the hotel chapel and then couples can go their separate ways. ""The idea is to offer a complete wedding experience,"" Dahlström told The New York Times. ""The idea is not to offer a wedding package. So, I don't really know that it is really for couples. But, I mean, there's absolutely no problem if you are just a group of friends."" The hotel has become something of a tourist destination, so"

The use of new ideas and advanced computer programs means that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. In the late 1960s, Hollywood abandoned the animated film, and a new genre of cartoons called live-action began to flourish. Many live-action films that were produced had little to do with actual animation. This was the age of ""muppet cartoons"", in which puppets were used to perform the roles of humans. One of the most important characters was the villainous Count Dracula. At the time there wasn't much opportunity for live-action movies about real people, and the public became used to films that were full of violence and violence. However, even if you don't like or want violence in the film, the animation on TV and in the movies still had a great deal of violence, and this made it difficult for parents and children to watch films on television. As a result, for the longest time, people thought cartoons were only for children, even though some films, like ""Tom and Jerry"", ""The Fox and the Hound"", ""Pom Poko"", and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" were very violent. At that time, live-action movies were very violent. It was a time when they were made to please people of a certain age group, and that group was very violent. For instance, a group of teenage boys will get drunk and go to a movie, and if they don't watch a cartoon, they don't know what to do. When they get home and turn on the television they will watch a live action movie with lots of.

The first examples of shoes were made of animal skins, usually horse or goat skins, which were tied around the ankle.

This was the beginning of shoes being made of leather but they were still generally made of animal skins, usually horse or goat skins, which were tied round the ankle. Shoes in the middle ages were still made of animal skins, usually horse and goat skins, which were tied round the ankles. Shoes in the late middle ages were generally made from sheep skin. Shoes in the seventeenth century became more like the shoes we see now. The first flat-soled shoes were made in the seventeenth century. Shoes in the eighteenth century were made of felt or leather. Shoes in the nineteenth century became more stylish and colourful. The twentieth century brought about flat soled shoes, but still made from natural materials like leather, and sometimes silk, cotton or felt. Over the years shoe style and materials.

Output the generated story directly. In the past, shoes were not important.  They were not really seen as fashionable either.  So, most people didn't really have the need to buy the latest fashion shoes.  If a person was going to buy a pair of shoes, then these shoes were likely to be worn for a specific occasion.  For instance, if a person was going to be on a trip, then they would have shoes that they could wear whilst they were on that trip.  These would be the shoes that they would wear when they went shopping, for example, or while they were working.  So, it wasn't a big deal if people were to run out of shoes or had a runny nose.  They could simply wear the shoes that they were currently wearing until they ran out of new ones.  Once that happened, they could just buy some new ones, which were likely to be a different colour than the pair that they were currently wearing.  So, most people just bought a few pairs of different pairs of shoes and only wore one of them whenever they went out of the house.  They would wear that one pair of shoes for a couple of months before they washed it, and then they could buy a new pair of shoes that would be slightly different from the pair that they had previously worn.

The most important advantage was that it could be driven by the average person. The price was cheap and it was safe. It was also the first car to have electric windows. It was also the first car to be developed in America. 

As time went by, he invented many other cars. Some of them are Ford Model T, Model A, Model L, Model P and Model R. In fact, Ford had been manufacturing different cars for almost four decades.

In 1905, Ford and a colleague invented the Ford Model T. The Model T was created to fill the gap between Ford’s Model A and Model L. It had more space and it could be driven by the average person.

Now I looked down at the river far below me and realised why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. Saturday came and it was time to go rock-climbing for the first time. I'd never rock-climbed before and it seemed like a great way to get into the outdoors for an afternoon. We parked the car outside the Activity Centre and walked in.  Our session was at 2pm but the group was pretty big and only 8 people had signed up. We chatted to the people before us and soon we'd all settled down to rock-climbing together.  At about 1pm it started to rain. The first few moments of rock-climbing were spent getting our shoes on and putting up our safety ropes. Then a lot of laughing took place as everyone tried out different hand positions while hanging on the rocks.  Matt and I found each other rather quickly. We were quite good friends already and we both chose to stick to the top of the wall. We'd just got our hands on each other's harnesses when our partners started making their way up the wall. I looked over at Matt and he was laughing as well. He and I had a great laugh and I started to make up our minds which hand position I should try next. Then we were all standing up and walking towards the wall.  The first thing you have to do is get your feet on a rock. Then it's easy to get your hands to work if you have a partner to hold onto, but without a partner it's.

B1,"Given this story: Shopping for furniture A report by Dave Worthington Homestyle a new furniture shop was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers including a leather sofa on sale for £45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). People were not so keen on the new furniture shop - Photo by Peter Hain. Shopping for furniture is an odd affair in the UK. Furniture retailing has been going to the dogs for years and now has the lowest level of consumer confidence among all consumer sectors in the UK. The same report also found that the average spending power of an average UK household is now £2,000 lower than a decade ago. This means that an average household now has less to spend than a decade ago when the average household had £3,500 in the bank. So why do people choose to buy a sofa or a bed?

Eden Project At first sight the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. The Eden Project The Eden Project, opened in 2006, is in the south-west of England. It has two large biospheres, the Tropical World and the Arctic World. Each of these contains different climates. They are both so popular that they can take up to four years to become fully booked. In each biosphere, visitors can see a different environment, from the tropics to the Arctic. For example, the Tropical World has rainforest areas, as well as the Great Barrier Reef. At the end of the day, it is difficult to choose the one climate zone that you would like to spend your holiday in. Each biosphere was created with the use of a different technique. For the Tropic World, for example, the team of local designers and planners spent 18 months collecting information about the area in the tropical rainforest. They then used computer simulations of tropical conditions to ensure that the environment matched the real one. For the Arctic World, however, there was already some information on the area. For example, there is now an international village of artists and musicians living in a permafrost village. These artists use the area’s natural materials such as wood and ice, and their work often.

The most amazing thing to me is that we can play the same song in a completely different style with different instruments. We had a lot of fun playing with our friends, and we’re really excited to go to the jazz concert we’re going to have in February. I love my trumpet. If you’d like to play it too, I highly recommend it. I love playing with friends. So I think playing with someone would make it more fun. It’s something that makes you smile and feel happy. I just really like jazz!  Our band won the competition! It was an amazing experience. And the most interesting part was playing on stage. I was so scared but I didn’t care because we won! The best part of playing with other bands was playing the same song in two different styles. We played four different pieces and they all sounded different. I also loved having a jazz class. I never thought I would like jazz because it’s so fast. But I’ve been playing for six months now and I can see it growing on me. I’m now looking forward to a jazz concert. It sounds like fun. I’m now going to have to work really hard to get in shape. I don’t think I’m in the shape I should be in to do that! But the concert should be fun. If you play anything.

In 1849, as San Francisco was rapidly expanding, the United States government was considering a move to a new capital city. The northern port of Philadelphia seemed a logical choice.

The most expensive stamp in the world sold for a whopping $1.56 billion. This makes the value of one stamp $1.56 x 10,000,000. That's equivalent to about $40 million dollars for every U.S. man, woman and child.      Stamp collecting is a real, legitimate hobby that is fun and can grow in value. Collectors pay a premium price for a stamp so that stamp collectors can own a unique and rare piece of history. It's a hobby that can grow and grow. People start collecting in childhood and as adults they often collect stamps of the countries they visited while traveling or to remember when they started collecting. Many people also collect different issues of the same stamp which are valued by the collectors in a different way, for instance for the different years.

B1,"Given this story: New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role 'I never expected to spend some of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I’d only ever acted at school but I'd loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her. One thing that’s particularly striking about The Finnegans Wake is that the opening sequence – which begins with a shot of the author’s first novel – is set in the present day. It’s a strange shift in the tone of the book, which so often starts in the past. Perhaps this is because, in the course of his work, Joyce was always looking forward. He wanted to chronicle the past, but he also wanted to capture the excitement of the future. You don’t get these shifts in tone much in modern fiction. I felt it was a deliberate attempt on the part of the screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy, to capture the energy of the early 20th century. It’s the same sort of energy that Joyce had when he first started writing about Joyce. He knew Joyce as a very exciting writer. He had a vision of what he wanted his novel to be about. His writing was driven by his sense of the future – of the excitement that he felt at the dawn of the modern age. One of the key events in The Finnegans Wake happens when the narrator, Finnegan, is sitting in a hotel in New York. He hears voices in his hotel room. He turns on the light and sees two ghosts – one female and one male. Both are dressed in robes and have beards. It’s one of my favourite scenes in the book. You read about it in the novel,.

B1,"Given this story: Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car recycling wine bottles not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out. I want to be clear about one thing right from the start - it wasn't my idea to become the BBC's ethical man. For a long time I couldn't tell if I was doing the right thing or not. Why? Because ethical behaviour seems subjective and it can be very difficult to assess the 'right' behaviour. What happens if you try and do the right thing in the wrong way, or with the wrong intentions? The problem is we rarely know if we are doing the right thing to begin with. This is when I started my ethical journey.      What changed my life came when I visited Nepal, where I saw first hand the devastating effect that the 2008 earthquake had had on the country and the people.

B1,"Given this story: We went to the park. We knew of fifty-two sons in prison. We made a circle of lights one for each son. People stopped to look at the dancing lights and came to ask about our campaign. By the time it was dark our camp had grown to more than fifty women. We had the most extraordinary success. We brought our protest to the city of Los Angeles, the seat of politics. But the politicians took offense. They asked their own public servants to stop us, they hired their own secret service to protect them, and they put up checkpoints all around our camp, stopping every car that drove by. Even though we didn't do anything wrong, it was the worst thing that anyone could do to us. But they could not stop our lights from dancing. In the end, the lights went out in all fifty states. Our lights kept dancing in the dark and we danced together with our fellow Americans who could not see. We knew that our lights were a part of something larger than ourselves and we danced on in unity, singing and playing musical instruments. And as we danced on, all fifty states came to the conclusion: there are fifty-two sons in prison. In a few weeks the lights will return to all fifty states. But for now, our friends in prison have our light. We are all brothers in prison.

A lot of people could be worried about this issue. People are not aware about this issue. Most importantly, the situation is getting worse. The city authorities are not able to bring back the sons. So the situation is getting worse, which means that the sons in prison cannot be released. In the end, the lights went out in all fifty states.

It has provided excellent service for people from all over the world and people of all ages and nationalities have stayed here. During the past 80years over 50000 guests from 174different countries have visited Sunningdale. The hotel is on one of the main roads leading to the town centre. The Sunningdale Hotel dates from the early 1920s. It first took the name 'Sunningdale Hotel', being a reference to nearby Sunningdale Farm which it stands on, then it was renamed 'The Sunningdale', which reflects the owners' love of the countryside surrounding the hotel. The owners spent a great deal of time there, often on horseback, or riding the miles of country lanes.  In the early 1960s a new development was made on the site of the old farm. A new building was constructed to cater for the increased number of guests coming to Sunningdale. This building, along with the original Sunningdale, has retained much of its original character. The hotel offers comfortable and clean accommodation for the whole family.  One of the many great pleasures for families at Sunningdale is to take the long walk around the farm. The countryside is wonderful; there are no streets and the houses are set back from the road, creating a feeling of privacy. The gardens of the hotel are also a great attraction, especially in summer time, especially the pond. It has been possible to take young people on horseback through the gardens. Sunningdale has been used for a number of film shoots. They include, 'Cyrano de Bergerac', 'Doctor Zhivago' and 'Titanic'.  The Sunningdale Hotel is a wonderful place to stay and has been able to carry on its reputation of being a friendly local.

In the 1880s gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod which means 'far distant place'.    The name 'Iditarod' came from a sled dog. It was not known at the time that dogs would be used in sled dog races. The musher's job would be to get the team over the finish line as soon as possible. The dog mushers' dogs would pull the sleds along by pulling the musher's body behind the dogs. The musher wore tights over his own legs which he had to pull tightly around his body in order to stay warm.  From the start of the race to the finish, the team of mushers covered more than 1,000 miles and raced through Alaska's arctic regions. Some were forced to abandon their dogs when they reached the arctic wilderness. For this reason the Iditarod musher is called the 'Iditarod Strong Man'. The Iditarod dog sled race was very popular amongst the locals. It was something that they could enjoy as a sport and a holiday and, because of its great success, it has grown into one of the most popular sports in the world.  The Iditarod is still run to this day, every March. The race will be continued until someone finishes the race..

It won't be safe to wait that long without them.” The next morning I got out of bed and grabbed my clothes. By the time I'd gathered my keys, my sneakers, and the four drums I heard Ben's door shut. I ran to the garage and found the four drums leaning against a refrigerator box that sat in the middle of the garage.

In 2003 Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath and come back up to the top without help. Free-diver Tanya Streeter holds four world records in a sport where competitors reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air. In 2003 she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath and coming back up to the top without help.      In the same year she also broke a record previously held by the late British star Richard Hughes, and now holds two records in the same discipline: the longest free dive (120 m) and longest free-diving ascent (170 m).      But she does so on a boat, which means she has only the crew to protect her, as opposed to being underwater alone. “There’s an incredible sense of accomplishment. It’s also an incredible way to die,” she says.      For the last seven years Streeter has been part of the team at Blue Ocean Society, a charitable organisation based in St Kitts, which provides recreational diving and diving education to the underprivileged.      “The project began as a simple idea that there was a way of diverting some of the funds that would otherwise be spent on tourism away from areas that were becoming unsustainable,” she said.      The organisation provides scholarships for students in the Caribbean and Africa, helps to pay for equipment for those that can afford it, and helps to maintain the dive sites where its divers operate..

In 2003, Streeter set a world record for swimming from the coast of the island of Sint Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean, to the coast of the larger island of St Kitts. She also set a record for the longest free-diving ascent, travelling 170 metres underwater with only one breath of air, in a free dive. 
Now, she and her Blue Ocean Society team have developed a new concept for a charity: free-diving for those in need. 
Blue Ocean Society operates a dive centre on St Kitts, where the company’s divers offer a full range of diving activities, from deep-sea diving for experienced recreational divers to free-diving for charity. “We want to make this a true recreational diving company in that we have a safe environment for people to dive, and we use dive gear that is second-hand and used for different purposes,” said Tanya Streeter. The charity also has an education programme that teaches diving skills to local people, but they also use their boats to take tourists on dive trips, so that they can focus on charity instead.
The Blue Ocean Society organisation was created as a project of The Atlantic magazine. With support from the British government and a grant from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the programme was started"

B1,"Given this story: MONEY What is money? The pound the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book a huge bag of sweets or a couple of cinema tickets. Money is a medium to transfer and store value and is an integral part of almost all economic activities. Many people, however, fail to notice that money does not necessarily have to be paper notes. We can, and do, trade in intangible things. Some would say we have entered a new economic age where money is no longer the most important thing but the medium of exchange. You may be asking yourself why, then, am I using so much paper for money when the internet, and social media, are much quicker and easier ways to make a transaction or exchange value? The answer is that paper currency is a good medium for money, or at least paper money in the form of £20 or £50 notes. This is because there are many people who do not own a phone or tablet. Or even more to the point, don't want to use a phone or tablet as it is too distracting and can impede you from paying attention to what's going on. On the other hand, it is a far easier method of money for some people. You can also pay for your things, and get your money, in exactly the same way as before using cash. There are various reasons why people use cash over other forms of money, including: They are uncomfortable giving away personal details over the internet. They are reluctant to give information over the phone. They don't like to make payments online due to payment processors fees. They want the money in a bag.

It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 metres. The Skywalk is a Sky Tower made in the Grand Canyon, the United States. This Skywalk takes people to the bottom of the canyon at the Grand Canyon National Park. It is a cable car that transports people from the edge of the canyon to the floor where the Skywalk is located.

B1,"Given this story: Watering the Desert  It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh Morocco. It doesn’t happen frequently and when it does the city’s water pipes can’t manage the sudden floods which turn the streets into rivers. But as many winters have remained dry in recent times when the rain does come it is welcomed by the local people. When a Moroccan government minister made a visit to the country’s deserts and lakes in mid-December he discovered a desert parched and dry as a bone. “People are scared for the future of their country,” he said. “Climate change is already affecting agriculture.” The minister wasn’t just talking to the media. A Moroccan research team, led by Professor Mohamed Abdelhamid at the University of Fez in northern Morocco, had the same thought. “If we don’t do something about climate change,” he told the media, “in 10 years we will have a desert from Casablanca to Rabat.” In other words, the desert from the Moroccan capital Rabat to the capital Marrakech – the only modern city in a country whose history dates back to the 9th century and has been the home of several kings and a global hub for the spice trade. The team of scientists took their warning to the people. They handed out flyers in cities across Morocco that announced the creation of an organisation called “Climate Change Action Committee”. Morocco’s desert stretches across 2.7m square kilometres (1.05m square miles). It is about 1,000 kilometres long and about 100 kilometres wide and although it never completely rains here, it does produce some snow in winter.

B1,"Given this story: HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It consists of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. The term honey, when used in the United States, also refers to a variety of beeswax. Both beeswax and honey are found naturally on plants, in the form of wax cells. The bees then collect the wax from the flowers they visit, which is their food. The bees also collect nectar from the flowers. Honey is a liquid made by bees, with sugar and water. It is sold in many forms, including: Sweet honey (a mixture of honey and liquid sugar) Natural honey (a mixture of honey and pollen) Sugar honey (a mixture of sugar and honey) Sweet beeswax (a mixture of beeswax and honey) Honey that has been boiled There are various ways to prepare honey. For sweetening tea, honey can be put into a teapot and poured into the cup. To make tea with boiled honey, the honey is added to the tea as the water is boiling, instead of being added to the boiling water. This allows it to melt and mix with the water. Other ways of preparing honey include making sweet sauce with it, drying it, and using it as a flavouring. Some of the other products made from honey include: Wax Wood preservatives Skin creams Lube Cinnamon-flavoured toothpaste Liquorice Honey is a sweet liquid that comes from bees. Honey is produced by bees,.

Output the generated story directly. Honey has been in use for thousands of years. The honeybees visit many different types of flowers, which means that they must collect nectar as well as sweet honey. Nectar is a very rich and complex fluid that can make up the majority of the honey produced by the bees. The nectar contains many different types of sugars that are essential for the bee's health. Honey is a mixture of these different sugars, together with a small amount of pollen. The bee's bodies process all this as they sleep and come back and work again the next day. The bees spend their entire lives doing this. The bee has to return to the flowers where it was sleeping, but the flowers will only be visited every few months. Then, honey will be collected and stored in the bee's body for the next time. They visit a different flower every three to five days, with some flowers only visited once a month. In the winter, the honey bee will come to hives and sleep in the warmth of the hive, although honey stores do not last as long in the winter. Bees do all of this even in very hot weather. 
I was fascinated by the idea that bees spend their entire lives making honey. I didn't know what bee's do all day, so I asked my grandma. She told me that honey is produced when honey bees sleep. There are only five species of honey bee, and each type of bee has its own bee hives. The bees work hard all"
B1,"Given this story: No Title Some people have complained about this year's collection New Writing 3 although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is pretty amazing? Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. The main thing that sticks out about New Writing 3, is that, for the most part, it's just OK. There's a fair bit of good writing in there (most notably the short stories of Rose Tremain and Candia McWilliam) and a lot of interesting ideas to chew on (though they could have been explored a lot more), but I didn't feel much emotional connection to the stories or to much of the writing in general. This is especially the case with the novel - although there are some interesting ideas and writing in there, none of the characters really come to life for me and the way they're written makes them seem wooden and unreal. That's a pretty big negative here, considering how well-written many of the short stories were. It's not all bad though, with some fun little nuggets from fiction writers such as Peter Carey and Simon Armitage. I'm not going to write a full review because there are already a few hundred reviews up there already, just wanted to point out that it might not be worth buying for the price and that the short story collections are much more engaging.

I remember my mum asking me and my sister if we would like  any drinks when I was probably around 5 or 6 years old, she said we could choose which one we wanted. I said lemonade but as I could never have lemonade without sugar I said sugar lemonade (which we did have that day), she replied and said she would buy the sugar lemonade next time, the same as she did every time she wanted to buy us a drink.      We all did this with all the same drinks, every time it was the one we liked. I think it started because we liked it when it was hot but the parent was worried that we would get too hot and so we ordered the one with sugar, but if they bought us the sugar without any drink in it then the kid would have drank it and been thirsty, so it worked out in the end.      Since when did advertising become the way it is now?      When I was young TV was very boring in comparison to the cartoons and movies that we watch now. Nowadays I would say there is more ads than content on TV,.

The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place that often worked. In May, a man on a bicycle said, “You have the best flat for rent I have ever seen. No problem. I’m on my way to your flat, to see it.” I got out of the car, and a woman of about 35 was speaking, and she told me her name was Anna and she had come from Estonia. She said she had lived here in Dublin for about four months before. She explained that her employer, who she was there with, was moving. She said he had left a letter on the doorman door and gave me the address. She said her English was not great. She had some money in her pocket. She could speak some Irish. I’d give the money to her, and we’d go to my flat, where she could get some rest and get ready for her trip. I wanted her to get to the next place as fast as she could so she could start work the next day. I gave her the key, and the next morning I got in the shower, and then I remembered, as I was putting on my clothes, that I had forgotten my wallet. I said to Anna, “I don’t have enough money to pay you,” and then I felt really terrible. I was glad to see her though, because it was clear that she had been out all night. She wanted to leave but I wouldn’t let her.

I was really scared about paying the money and I didn’t even have €40, and you’re here, working, for free.

People looked at them and wondered if this event was connected in any way with the paragraph in the morning's paper. ""It seems our friend, the author of the paragraph, was a man who had made up his mind long ago that he didn't want to live much longer,"" Philippe explained. ""It appears he was sitting in that box thinking of something, and when he heard us talking about his name he simply couldn't stay on any longer, so he jumped up and left the theater just in time to miss the performance."" ""But how is it you found out? You said the door was locked,"" Raoul asked. ""That was the clue,"" Philippe explained. ""We all know the door is never locked in the performance hall, but we didn't realize that for the very few people who have tickets to these plays, it means something special. The only person who knew it was the author of the paragraph was the person who called the theater saying that he'd like to speak to a doctor. That is, until I opened the door and, to my horror, discovered him dead."" ""You're saying you were at the door when you discovered him?"" ""Yes,"" Philippe said. ""I saw the look in his eye and realized he was going to die. I quickly ran out into the lobby where I rang the alarm. It only took a few minutes for the police to arrive.""

B2,"Given this story: Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. The dolphin is the most recognisable mammal on the planet. Not only are they often caught in the act of splashing about in aquariums or swimming in their natural environments, their striking appearance - the white snub-nosed, flat-snouted dolphin with the blue body and grey fins that many of us associate with swimming in the sea - makes them instantly recognisable. But there are fewer dolphins in the world than there have been for 30 years, and experts are worried that the decline is driven by commercial fishing. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is a scientific body that sets guidelines on conservation, there are around 100,000 dolphins in the world, but that number has been dropping for the last four decades, from about 400,000 in the late 1970s to around 100,000 today. Why are the dolphins in trouble? The most obvious factor is commercial fishing. In the 1960s, when they were caught in nets, they were worth a lot of money to the people who caught them. Since 1970, however, the dolphins have been caught in a system in which they are deliberately trapped and sold. The dolphins are hooked with a long metal hook and pulled out to sea and then sold to the highest bidder. There are many illegal fishing operations that use dolphins as bait in places like Somalia and Africa, but the biggest issue is commercial fishing. Fishing for dolphins has led to a decline in their populations - and.

We may try and convince ourselves that we aren't a part of the ""Digital Divide,"" that we have access to all the same information, just through a different mode of communication. We know that the real divide is access to time, and in many cases, money. It's easy for us to believe that the new digital age means a more equal and less divided world. It means a world where any person with a computer and an internet connection can have a job, sell their creative work on the web, or simply make a friend across the world. It sounds like a simple equation. All they have to do is get a job and start a blog, and they can be the center of the world. In this equation, the first part is very important. The employer needs to recognize the value of the blog; the company needs to be able to pay the bills, hire the people, and afford the infrastructure needed to operate a blog. To put it another way, a blog is not free. And so the next few years will be spent learning how to make money with a blog, and how to balance working on it with working a job.

Ever since the four of us began to go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea not far from the village of Ardbeag. The old lady was very happy, and in fact, it seemed to have been one of her happiest years. She had been so busy the last few years, trying to make the old house as comfortable as she could for her grandchildren, that she had lost track of how good she really felt.  She looked forward to the holiday with great pleasure. She had a good housekeeper, a young man in his mid-forties called Tom who looked after the house, and the three other children, Tom, Molly, and Fergus, who lived with her, but who were not guests in the old house. They went on holiday with the parents, usually in a caravan, which was very convenient for families living in the country, and it was also much cheaper than travelling by car or plane in the modern world. It was very important for her to keep this tradition alive, and one of the first things she did, once they had arrived at Glencorn Lodge, was to ask Tom to bring her a caravan, and they set off for Ireland.      The sun came out in the afternoon, and it was very hot, as it was still June, but there was a sea breeze that cooled everything. They went for a walk on the beach, and when they returned to the old house, they went swimming. The old lady made Tom promise not to take any photos of them in the water, because she did not want the children to become famous before they had.

High above them on the climbing wall hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. Lombard is the only man in the world able to ascend the world's highest wall, the ""Monk's Staircase"" at 7,856 feet (2,291m). His goal is to scale every wall in the world, without rope.  This year he hopes to go from one side of the globe to the next. With four stops on his trip, he has so far climbed in Japan, Vietnam, South Africa and now Birmingham.  Lombard's stunt is part of the sport climbing competition. He is one of 10 competing climbers, all of them men, all of them over the age of 30. In a week, they will compete to be the first to climb a certain number of routes on a competition wall. They climb by holding onto metal bars that extend from the wall, one for every 2.5 feet (0.8m).  Climbing is a sport, which in the early 1990s began to make it into the Olympics. It had not been part of the games before. Climbing is now a medal event in the Olympics.  The sport is climbing -- climbing like your favorite Olympic sport, alpine skiing or ice hockey. People climb because it's hard and also because it's fun.  The sport began with a few hundred people who would hold onto metal bars and try to climb the steep walls of rock that are found in the Alps. Climbing.

But now it was not the world's only network of computers. After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful other networks began to appear. The internet started in the United States in 1969.  The ARPAnet started in 1973 with France, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Finland and West Germany as the initial backers. However, the internet is most famous for connecting American and Soviet computers and users at the time. The first email messages appeared in 1974. It took two years and hundreds of meetings between US government officials and their Soviet counterparts for the United States to gain entry into the ""Information Superhighway"". By this point, the ARPAnet was nearly complete. By 1979, the network was used by more than 500,000 participants. By 1986, it had become the second-largest computer network in the world.  Although the Internet started with two countries in the US and two countries in the USSR, in the next twenty years, it would connect hundreds, if not thousands, of countries from nearly every country in the world. This would ultimately change how people communicated and interact with one another.  One of the factors that led to the rapid creation of the internet is the way in which ARPAnet users could access other ARPAnet nodes. A US university node could not operate for more than two hours without connecting to a US government node which was available in the US Department of Defense.  The internet's popularity has not been limited to countries on the ARPAnet. The ARPAnet allowed a number of networks to form, all of.

'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. I always get confused when there are people in here complaining that this is not a funny story. Because it is not a funny story. In the words of a great British TV character: ""That's just terrible"" - and it is. So here's the story. We had a new boss at work a few months ago, and her name is Karen. She is very pretty and well respected in her field. Everyone loves her except, sadly, me. I just don't think she has what it takes. It seems she's really bad at listening. She seems to think that if you want her to do something then you need to yell at her loud and clear. She's also really hard on her staff, and that just makes everyone hate her. It's kind of a vicious circle. So one day I go into her office and tell her that I think she's terrible and I'd like her to be more reasonable, and not yell, and she kind of just gives me a look like, ""Yeah. Okay. I understand."" So it's back to work. A week later she comes into the office again, just to check in and see how we're doing. She doesn't look like she's in a good mood at all. In fact, she kind of looks really angry. And she sits down at her computer and starts typing away like her usual very annoying self. I just want to punch her in the face. She eventually just looks at me.

There's something exciting about cooking a great meal and seeing customers enjoying the food and the atmosphere. I didn't expect to be cooking for a famous chef, but I was delighted to be in the restaurant. I hadn't cooked for customers before, but I felt confident because my son was the star chef. As the kitchen filled with cooking smells, I felt nervous and excited at the same time. Gary was a natural with food and had been cooking since he was young. I thought of all the things he'd learnt about food, the best techniques and the perfect ingredients. He looked very stylish in his chef's uniform, black trousers and a short-sleeved white shirt. He was very proud of his new uniform and had already been talking to his friends about the new restaurant. He was an impressive young man with an easy charm about him. Gary was my pride and joy. I wasn't worried about his future, but I was a little worried about his looks. He wasn't the most attractive young man, but I knew he was a hard worker and the best looking man I'd ever seen.

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch had her heart set on working in the Alps, but her parents refused to let her leave home in 2015. “They didn’t want me to go so they offered to buy me a chalet in the French Alps,” she says. “I said I wanted to go work at one of the big five ski resorts there, so I could see the snow and actually ski, and instead I’ve been working at Tignes chalet for the past two years.” She has worked hard to earn her place at the top of the ski industry and she’s now the youngest person to hold that title. She is also the first woman to work at the summit of the world’s five highest mountains. In 2015, she became the youngest to work at the top of any mountain at 20 years old and a month. Last year, she spent the summer working as a chalet girl at the British Alps mountain resort of Tignes and then worked at the Italian resort of Courchevel in the French Alps over the winter. Now she is back in France to work at one of the top resorts in the French Alps. “The Tignes chalet is right next to the piste which starts at the bottom of the chalet,” Sarah says. “If we’ve been out skiing, our chalet is at the bottom of the ski.

Nearly fifteen years later nobody has beaten that time. Have we got to the human speed limit? Dr Frances Ashcroft Professor of Physiology at Oxford University explains the limits of the human body during a race. If a record-breaker breaks a world-class mark by a little and the world's media are not convinced it is a world-class mark, why are some so convinced they know better? In 1998 the world-class Moroccan athlete Hicham El Guerrouj broke the 1500-metres world record with a time of 3:26.72. The record was finally beaten in 2008 by Sifan Hassan, a Dutch athlete. Hassan broke the record in a time of 3:26.35. Nobody has broken that record again. Now there are other sports. There is the world's long jump and the long jump record was broken in Paris last year. Both men recorded jumps of 7.34 metres, but the second athlete came from outside the athletics world, having just been a professional footballer. Then there is the world's 100m hurdles record. This was held by another Moroccan athlete, Omar McLeod, from 2000 to 2014. On the day of his retirement it was broken by American Keni Harrison, who has also just been a footballer (though not a professional one). And then there is the world's hammer throw record: the last person to do this was American Jim Ryun in 1991. No one has beaten it since. So how do we make sense of these events? We can look at the facts and try to figure out whether the athletes might be better off at the other event. This is called'situational efficiency'.

It is full of her favourite flowers most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings and her large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects.  She is particularly interested in varieties of tulips and poppies, but she is also inspired by plants from her local area such as the dandelion, the bee balm, and the buttercress. She grows all these in the garden that she has been creating over the years to make it a place where people can enjoy the beauty of these plants, especially in the cooler months when they cannot get as much sun as they would like. These plants are used in her large flower paintings that she does in watercolour, and which are quite stunning. As well as her paintings, she also creates booklets on her subjects, and she paints for local charities. Susan is particularly fond of butterflies, not only because they look so majestic but also because they are so important in terms of the pollination of other plants.  She takes great pleasure in getting down to work and being able to use her creativity on a daily basis. She says that she feels truly fulfilled when she completes her projects and that this is something that she gets from her father. “He is the first person that ever encouraged me to do what I do. Without him, I would not be here.”  In her work, Susan uses her eye for detail to make her paintings really special, and to bring out the beauty in the plants that she.

As netball's popularity in Britain has grown, its profile has taken on a wider significance. It was one of the first sports to be included on the London Olympic programme, and the country has developed a fine collection of netball stars. The most successful have been Kelly Russell, Jade Clarke, Jo Harten and Natalie Haythornthwaite, the latter winning the Olympic gold medal. Slowinski is one of those star performers.

Skates were made of animal bone. Then, they made them of human skin covered with fur. Around the 1300’s, wood was introduced to make skates. Now, these skates are called skate boots. They were often made of leather, but some of the skates were made entirely of wood. A wooden skate boot was made to fit the foot of the skater perfectly. A human figure eight shaped boot was created. The foot of the skater was placed in the center of the figure.  A human figure eight shaped boot was created. The foot of the skater was placed in the center of the figure.  Skate boots, like modern skates, have an iron heel. This allows skaters to propel themselves while the iron heel is pressing on the ice. The heel would normally be hollow. This would allow the skater to use their feet to propel themselves around the ice without their heel pressing down. In modern skates, the iron heel also prevents the skater from slipping and falling. The figure 8 shaped boot would allow a skater to get the most from their skates. The human figure 8 shape gives the skater enough stability to keep.

The ice rink and the ice hockey rink make the most popular events at the club. As part of the club, students get the chance to try a variety of ice skating activities. The instructor shows all the students a proper skating form and teaches the most basic skating skills. When these students have mastered the basic skating forms, they move on to the more difficult ice skating skills, such as toe-toe and half-step skating. Most of the students, who are young students, can not afford to buy a pair of ice skates, but the club makes available any necessary equipment and gives the students a place to practice on a regular basis. The club has a small summer camp for young children, who are interested in ice skating. It is not difficult to get the children interested in ice skating, since they are the future generations of ice skaters. During the summer, the children can learn to skate by themselves and they practice their new skills at the club during the winter and the summer months. The younger members of the club take up their new sports in a friendly way, while the more experienced members also help to motivate the younger members.

England's Kendra Slawinski has just two days to go until she leads her team out at the World Championship in Liverpool. It is her first World Cup as captain. The World Cup has been a long time coming. When she first took the captaincy in 2011, Kendra was the second youngest ever captain behind Australia's Rachael Harford. But England were plagued with complaints about the officiating during the World Cup. And they won just half of their matches against New Zealand and Australia. Last year they reached the semi-final, but were knocked out by eventual winners New Zealand. This year England face South Africa, New Zealand and Australia in the group stages. It is a tough group, but they are the top ranked team in the world. This is Kendra's first major tournament as captain. She said she was proud to be taking on the role in her home country. ""It means a lot to me,"" said Kendra. ""I want to lead by example, I want to be a positive role model for the younger generation. The older girls have really helped me over the last few years and I just want to repay that by helping the younger girls. I want them to grow up and know that netball is a great sport."" In the early 90s, the two teams were separate, but after the Brits' dramatic victory over the Mighty Wallabies at the Commonwealth Games in Perth in 1994, and an increase"
B2,"Given this story: Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m cycle 40km and then run 1Okm? Because 'it's fun'. Teenager with a taste for endurance WANTED: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete preferably female. Chance to work with potential Olympic champion. Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions) distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage). If you're looking for a training partner to swim, cycle and train in the cold river, then check this ad out - it describes a 16-year-old girl who's keen on triathlon and swimming, but who is also an incredibly strong, competitive swimmer, and wants to put those two things together. I think that this kind of combination means that she is more likely to love distance running than almost anyone else, and she should be extremely keen on distance swimming. What she really needs, though, is someone who's really into that training schedule. (A girl can have too many interests!)      For those who might wonder about the girl and what kind of person she might be like, she says she's an open, relaxed and friendly person, and she seems to be a reasonably competent runner and cyclist as well as the triathlete. I'm sure she has at least one friend who wants to put her through some training, but it would be good to have the opportunity to work with a potential Olympian.      We want you! We really really do! As I said, an addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful. We think you'll love it.     It's a bit of a long shot, but what the hell? (And it would be fun to see her in the Olympic village.)First off, I really enjoy this story. I wonder, is this a girl from the US, where.

When it comes to news, there’s more than you can shake a stick at. That's the problem for a variety of reasons. First, while it’s certainly easy to get caught up in news stories across a wide range of topics – from the latest celebrity gossip to an in-depth look at the presidential election – we’re in the information age and, to some extent, we’re living in a golden age for news. It’s a never-ending stream of news. And this deluge comes with an uncomfortable side effect: There’s just too much to keep up with, to absorb, to keep track of. And then there are the big stories, the biggest stories – the ones that dominate headlines across the globe. From a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage to the most dramatic terrorist attack in France in decades, these are the kinds of stories that make news headlines. Then there are smaller stories, the kind of things we read about in a newspaper in small, local chunks. Maybe a story about a local business owner closing their doors for good – the kind of story that gives reporters an excuse to write about what happens when a community is in the process of being erased. Or maybe we’re reading about a young family that lost their home in a fire, or a group of kids who recently won scholarships after they participated in the American Cancer Society’s Rel.

B2,"Given this story: Trying to get published? If you are wondering where to send your story our expert Margaret Stubbs is here with the advice you need. Readers of this magazine often write in saying 'I have written this story / book. This year’s theme for the Bookmark is The Longer Story: a call to writers to use the power of long form narrative to tell more engaging, satisfying stories. What I love best about reading a book is how the author is able to take a complex concept or relationship and turn it into a long-form story that allows the reader to see their relationship to the topic from a new angle. This is what books do so well: they help us look at the world in a different way. The power of the long form story extends beyond books, however. When the short story was invented, the idea of a short story was limited, because short stories were usually a single event. As we move into the novel, however, the short story has the potential to be much more complex, as a form allows the storyteller to explore ideas through characters, scenes and plot. One of the strengths of the short story is that it allows the author to play with the form and allow the reader to feel a certain degree of freedom. This is something that the novel often does not do: the reader is given specific instructions and sometimes they just have to stick to them. In both short stories and novels, the short story and the novel work in a similar way. Short stories and novels are very much about the details of each story: which character is doing what, what is that person doing next? The idea that the reader has, is that these are the 'facts'.

B2,"Given this story: In the weeks before the end of the tax year everyone in the firm was especially busy. With no wife to go home to Mitch worked later than anyone else. Besides he had extra work to do. One night at three in the morning he unlocked Avery's office on the fourth floor with one of the keys Abby had given him. Once he opened the door, he realized with horror that his assistant had been murdered. He found her with several bullet holes in her chest.  ""Abby! What are you doing!"" He shouted as he fell to the floor. He felt the air rush from his body. He looked around his office. It was empty of people. There was a chair in front of the desk where the assistant's seat should have been. Behind it was a desk with files and papers strewn about. He picked up one of them and found that it was missing. He saw the pen and paper next to the desk were gone. He saw the door was open. He found her body slumped over her desk. The blood of the two victims was on his feet, as he had been trying to get away from her. With every step he took, more of the body was uncovered. His hands were covered in her blood. His knees were covered with splotches of her flesh. The only thing not covered in blood was his face. The killer had shot her in the head, then dragged Mitch out of the room and into the hall. He heard the door to the back office open and close. Then the killer left the room. He looked at the body lying on his office floor. It was his assistant. His hands shook as he thought of all the things she might've had to do for him. Abby had to give him directions to the train and even drove.

It had been only a few hours since she'd left for work, and he'd already had to deal with this on top of everything else. He ran down to the fifth floor where her office was and found her slumped over her desk with a bullet hole in her chest. Her body had been covered by several pieces of her office furniture as her killer dragged Mitch into the hall. Mitch felt the same sharp pain in his head as he had when he'd shot Abby, and he remembered that he'd had a stroke several months ago that had reduced the blood flow to his face. He'd had no time to wipe up her blood and now his right hand was in a cast. He took out one of the empty bullet casings, feeling sick and numb. He didn't think about the fact that the killer probably left him there while he was trying to run away. Mitch had noticed that the door to the back office was open, so he knew she had already gone to get the phone. He could hear the killer leaving the room, so he must've gotten there in time to call 911. He remembered thinking that the person he was calling may be a police officer, but it was so late at night that he probably wouldn't be able to tell if the person on the other end was a police officer or a robber. He didn't say anything while he waited for the police to arrive, but he realized that this would just be"

Lovely villages with old temples attract me not empty deserts. When I was eight I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. As a little boy, I never dreamed I would work as an actor. The day I was accepted to the National Youth Theatre in my home town of London, it was to perform Shakespeare and that was it.  My parents said: “You can be an actor and go on to do anything you want, but we won’t let you try football because you have a bad leg”. They were right. I broke my leg as a teenager playing football and it’s still not right today. Yet I could never do another job if I didn’t follow my dream. A trip to my homeland, India, to direct a production of The Crucible for the Indian National Theatre, led me to meet my wife and I think my destiny. We got married there on the beach. Since then we have been back every year. We have three kids and five grandkids and we just love India. When I was a teenager I saw the Beatles at Wembley Arena. And when I saw them again two years ago at a sold-out O2 Arena in London, I got more goose bumps than I got then. I’ve followed them since 1964 and it’s still the greatest band of all time. I love the way they do their songs, how well they sing, the energy they show and the amazing stage shows. Last year, I wrote a book and it was a big thrill. My wife is an editor and she.

B2,"Given this story: Careers Advice You're not happy in your job at the moment but you don't know how to change? Kitty Doherty gives some good advice. The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser. You will be asked to write a brief history of yourself and then sit through a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. My friends and I were discussing the advice that we had received from careers advisers when we were at school. I realised that while I thought it was really good advice when I was younger, I don't think I really took much note of it at the time, maybe because I was so busy going on about my life, and what I wanted to do with it. When you ask someone for advice, it is easy to get all caught up in the detail of the advice you receive, and lose sight of what the point of the advice is. After all, the advice is only advice if you take it, and you will only be able to take it if it is right for you. So when you ask for career advice, it is important to think about what the goal of the advice is. If the advice is 'you should become a teacher', then you need to decide whether you actually want to be a teacher. If the advice is 'you should be a surgeon', then you need to decide whether you want to become a surgeon. This isn't always as easy as it seems though, as our job, and the things that drive us, can change in the course of our lives. The first question you need to answer, is whether you want to become a careers adviser. This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links.

Output the generated story directly. A carefree teenager decides to change her career, only to find that her dream job turns out not to be so carefree after all. The story has good detail and the plot moves along smoothly. It is not very long either and could have been a good story for an issue of a magazine or newspaper. There is not a lot of dialogue in the story either, which was good for this type of article. The story would benefit from some editing to remove redundancies, extra words, and punctuation that is not needed. The story would be better with some added detail about the job, such as how long the career consultant worked with the teenager, what tests the teen had to go through, and what the teen got out of her career advice session. In addition, a bit more detail about how the teenager had to change her style of speech, how difficult it is to make other people take you seriously in your new job, and how the job affected the teenager would all have improved the story. However, it is still a good story about a young woman trying to find her place in the world. The main character is not especially sympathetic, so I think that would be okay for a magazine or newspaper story. Overall, this would be a good story to illustrate some careers advice.Careers advice is something that we as a society have taken for granted for so long, as if it were guaranteed to us by our parents, teachers or career advisers.

She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. My name is Rachel Mills and I teach and do research into marine geochemistry which means I study the chemical processes happening in the sea. I am a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. I do everything from studying the movement of water in the ocean to trying to figure out how to reduce the plastic pollution in the ocean. There have been quite a few conferences on plastic pollution in the oceans, in January there will be the sixth meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of the Marine Environment (UNCME). It is an international body which decides the future of the oceans and how to look after them. The ocean is going through a number of big changes, and I think that we are responsible for some of these changes. For example, people are throwing so many plastic bottles into the ocean. Also, there is more shipping and fishing happening around the world. So, it is hard to say where the blame is really due to but there are a lot of issues with our actions in the ocean. We are getting involved with all the plastic, we can see how much plastic there is now and we might have to make changes to help. We have to look at reducing plastic pollution and make sure that other issues like poverty and inequality don't get in the way of looking after the oceans. I have a big passion for the ocean. I love studying marine geochemistry and going down to the bottom of the ocean to try and make sense of what is going on. There is an incredible.

My name is Rachel Mills and I teach and do research into marine geochemistry which means I study the chemical processes happening in the sea. I am a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. I do everything from studying the movement of water in the ocean to trying to figure out how to reduce the plastic pollution in the ocean. There have been quite a few conferences on plastic pollution in the oceans. In January there will be the sixth meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of the Marine Environment (UNCME). It is an international body which decides the future of the oceans and how to look after them. The ocean is going through a number of big changes, and I think that we are responsible for some of these changes. For example, people are throwing so many plastic bottles into the ocean. Also, there is more shipping and fishing happening around the world. So, it is hard to say where the blame is really due to, but there are a lot of issues with our actions in the ocean. We are getting involved with all the plastic, we can see how much plastic there is now and we might have to make changes to help look after the oceans. We have to"
B2,"Given this story: Kowloon Walled City had no wall around it. Standing apart from the neighbouring buildings it rose to fourteen floors-buildings with more buildings piled on top. Legally it belonged to the People's Republic of China a part of the colony that was never British. In fact neither Chinese nor British law had effect there. This is a picture taken from the Walled City in Hong Kong. I thought it would be interesting to see a city without a wall. The walled city that was located near the harbour of Kowloon on the territory of Hong Kong, was in fact a part of the British colony, that was never recognised by the mainland of China. This is a picture of the buildings that were around the walls of the city. This area was not only for the city but was for the rest of the area's residents, except for the Chinese who had their own area. In fact British law didn't have effect on this area and neither did Chinese law. They had their own rules and laws. This was what I though was interesting in the image. I am glad it was. You can read more about it in Wikipedia. You might also like this quote by J. R. R. Tolkien. “The Shire is of the Shire.

Fun Island - The Burns family Last year we went to a huge theme park in the US and we thought that Fun Island might seem dull by comparison. The thing I love most about Fun Island, is that no matter who you are, what you're looking for, or what age you are, you can find it here! We've been for a variety of reasons for the last two years, and have never found it disappointing!  First of all, it is a vast theme park, covering just over four times the area of Blackpool! It's a sprawling complex of rides, attractions, restaurants, entertainment and much more!  Of course, it offers more than just theme park rides - it also boasts a huge variety of restaurants and bars, which offer all sorts of things to eat and drink, both fast food and fine dining.  In this park you can relax on the beach, dine in a luxury restaurant, try your luck in the arcade, spend an afternoon at a swimming pool, or ride the roller coasters.  Fun Island is one of the world's leading theme parks and boasts being the largest indoor water park in Europe. It has a host of water rides, water slides, pools, spas and a huge area of water playing area - for all ages and abilities.  One of the attractions we enjoyed the most is the lazy river. It is great fun for both children and adults and an excellent form of exercise!  Another great attraction is the wave pool, which offers a series of fun wave rides. Again, the water rides here are fun for all ages - and if it.

When the children's nanny left this summer, I looked for a new place to take my nieces and nephews - and Fun Island just happened to be having a closing down sale!  I'd never heard of this place before, but I'm glad I did!  I've had such fun taking the children on rides and seeing the parks attractions - and my nieces and nephews have been so delighted with what Fun Island has to offer!  We were all surprised when the ride we were going to try was a giant one called 'The Big Fat Cyclops' - and then we saw that we had to go in through a hatch, which made it even more exciting!  There was also a lot of laughter and fun as we rode the rides that we'd never been on before.  They'd all never ridden anything as big as the Big Fat Cyclops before.  And for all the ages there's something to enjoy - from children right through to the elderly.  I think the children would have enjoyed everything, but the little ones especially loved the wave pool and lazy river.  It was a great holiday for them, as well as the rest of us!  I would like to repeat this experience whenever the weather is hot and the nanny returns home.  I think all my nieces and nephews would agree that Fun Island is one place they will always remember.

Julia Gregson asked three young stars and their mothers to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. A. Annika Reeder 15 won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. Her mother is a nurse, her father drives buses for the government in a town of about 20,000, and her brothers are 14 and 12.

In the UK, the kingfisher is one of the few wild birds that is able to be seen breeding on its breeding grounds.

Like technical difficultiesstudio audiences are just another common feature of television lifeand yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows for example we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? It is, according to the script, the moment of truth. In the next 30 seconds, the contestants of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here will find out whether they are going to be eaten or not, and if they are they'll be in the knowledge that at least two hundred million people are watching, along with hundreds of commentators and millions of others on satellite, mobile phones and computers. It's huge, and it's a big deal. There will be phone-in questions, and the panel are likely to be nervous. The contestants must have their heads down, be focused, act brave, and have no emotion at all. And they have just two minutes and thirty-five seconds. The pressure is huge. Even though most of us have little clue what goes on in a TV studio, we are somehow able to judge the contestants in a way that an on-air personality can never dream of.  For those of us who love TV drama, it's almost sacrilegious to talk about watching the studio audience. When we talk about watching TV drama we mean the drama at the bottom of the screen, not the drama on the top. The drama in the bottom, where the cast and crew are creating the work we see on the top, that we love and that takes us away to somewhere wonderful. But the drama at the bottom, where the cameras record the work of the writers and producers, is often the best drama we have. We get to see.

The three men get on well, and Cosmo gets bored with having to eat alone so Bill invites Cosmo to join the dinner party. The following morning Cosmo meets Bill and Brian at the hotel lobby, where they discuss ideas for stories for the next night's television show. Cosmo has a story idea and asks Bill if they should run it, or run a different idea. Bill says they should probably run Cosmo's idea, and then Brian looks around the hotel at all the hotel rooms, asking how many hotel rooms are booked for the next night, and when they all say none he suggests the four of them get a room in one of the rooms, so they can gossip about it in the morning. Cosmo objects to this, as he has to be back for breakfast. Brian, being a producer, insists that they leave early in order to work. Bill says he will take Cosmo home, but after they reach Bill's apartment, Cosmo objects, saying he only wants to go to a hotel breakfast and does not want to go home yet. Bill tries"
B2,"Given this story: It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. Chris Greener, whose 7.4 metre tall body still holds the world record for largest human body weight, has announced that he will quit showbusiness and take a job as a civil servant.      The 33-year-old, who has lived in a council house since he broke the record in 2000, was spotted by ITV when he appeared on the reality show 'Big Brother' and was later a member of the Westlife pop band in the noughties.      He said he was considering giving up his career because his new-found fame had put him on the radar of criminals.      ""I had a couple of incidents recently, although nothing serious and that got me to thinking that this is getting too dangerous for me,"" he told reporters outside the Houses of Parliament.      ""There are all kinds of weirdos who think I am some kind of celebrity now. I have got a bit of fame so they might think they can go around taking money from my bank account or something like that. I decided this was getting too dangerous.""      He said he had no plans to marry or have children.      The BBC understands that Greener has had to cancel a number of bookings because of the changes to his schedule.      ""I am not going to leave my full-time job, it's not what I was born to do,"" said Gre.

But it's not safe and after what happened a couple of weeks ago with my car getting broken into, I've had to reassess what I want to do. I was just driving down the road and I realised I was being followed and there were two men standing by my car trying to get it running again. That was the last straw and I decided I wanted to do something other than this. 

At first I was just going to do my job and leave showbusiness alone, but the money wasn't enough and I've got three kids to feed. My wife and I had to put my youngest boy in foster care because we couldn't pay for him. Things have been tough and now my focus will only be on my family. We've got no money now and I haven't got a day's wage to give any of my other staff, so my decision will affect a lot of people. I've made up my mind not to be famous any longer. 

I still want to get into showbusiness and I still think I'm talented and I still love doing it and I'm going to give it a go. Maybe one day I'll get back into it and start from scratch again, but at the moment I want to start a new life.

B2,"Given this story: GM's clever EN-V concept is a two-wheeled two-seater solution to urban transport. Telegraph Motoring's Mike Rutherford has a preview and takes it for a spin. That's because of the nature of the EN-V. Last week I drove one of these though it was more like flying a small plane than driving. A couple of months ago, I took the opportunity to drive the all-electric Chevy Bolt. I thought it was a cool idea but, in hindsight, a little flawed. I would like to know whether or not GM is still developing the concept.  Well, no. It was revealed in June that GM was discontinuing development of the EN-V. In a recent interview with Motoring (above), GM CEO Mary Barra says it is “not a core business for us anymore.” That doesn’t mean it’s dead, just not a priority.  It’s not entirely clear what GM intends to replace it with. However, I would expect there will be another electrified model released in the coming years, likely as an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle. It will be much smaller and lighter, and it will be intended as a personal mobility solution to meet consumer demand for smaller urban mobility. It will likely be available to anyone who meets GM’s strict safety and safety compliance standards and wants one.  There’s also a chance it will be a larger truck-based SUV option like GMC Hummer and Chevrolet Silverado EV options that will be unveiled next year. That makes sense. The Chevrolet Bolt EV is a hatchback and the Hummer EV is a pickup truck. The Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid sedan and the Buick Encore EV is a subcompact crossover that shares.

Output the generated story directly. General Motors announced this week that it is killing off the Chevrolet EN-V, a vehicle designed to run on electricity. The company said that while it enjoyed the car's popularity, it is moving on without it.
""EN-V has been a very well-received product, but it just wasn't part of our core business,"" GM's vice president of global product development and purchasing Mark Reuss said in a statement, per Reuters.
The car was unveiled in 2012 and received positive reviews. It was designed as a two-seat solution to urban transport. The company even said it would allow drivers to travel between locations as short as 1/4 mile, which is about four blocks.
However, GM didn't sell many of the cars. Last year, it stopped selling the car in the United States, although it continued to sell it in China.
Still, Reuss didn't rule out the possibility of the car returning in a more formfitting fashion in the future.
""It's not over,"" he added. ""We'll continue to evaluate things. We will have to see what the market's appetite is.""
One interesting thing is that, when asked about a possible return, Barra said that GM will still be looking at electric vehicles.
""I think the future is electric. But again, it’s not the core of our business right now, that you see the Bolt EV, that you see the Hummer EV. That's our future"

Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear. In one chapter there is an analysis of how New York would survive if there were no humans to take care of it. To quote from the end of Weisman's book: If humanity vanished entirely from the Earth, its impact on the biosphere would be more than just an abstract idea. Our existence is fundamental to life, and no civilization would leave no trace behind. There would be massive ecological changes, but also cultural ones. Humans are not only a source of energy: we also provide social, political, economic and architectural patterns through which the planet's life is organized. If there were suddenly no more humans, the Earth would no longer have humans to provide its food, water, energy, medicine, technology, etc. There would be enormous ecological changes, but also cultural ones. What would happen to our planet if suddenly there was nothing human at all? This was the basic hypothesis behind Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us. The main character is a physicist who works on understanding the Earth's rotation and the changes that occur when continents move. When we stop thinking of our existence as part of a continuous, unending process, we can start looking at other parts of the ecosystem in a new light, says Weisman. It is this concept that informs the way he analyzed the situation if humans disappeared. The Earth would start to feel like a foreign planet. It would have a sense of mystery to it. Our existence would influence our ecosystem. We would have to leave our mark. But there would be far-.

But I've got to get some chores done, and some ironing to do, and the boys need me for supper. Then I can come home and do it all.

Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion. Ned Ingham: Dress Designer Ned Ingham makes dreamy romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles' he explains. Mixed prints are a huge trend for Spring-summer 2013. Think a forest green overcoat with a black jumper and a blue skirt. This may not be my first choice of dress but I think it makes a great outfit. I like the contrast of the colours and the pattern. The overcoat is by the London based brand Belly. It comes in a wide range of colours in a number of designs.  Dollars to doughnuts, I bet this is a Belly-brand coat. That’s what I think. This coat is available on the Belly website and there are loads of colours and patterns available. The overcoat is just gorgeous. It’s a bit of a puffer-coat so it’s very lightweight, it has a zip opening and a removable hood. It’s perfect for a hot summer’s day. It is available in all sizes up to 5XL so you can get the size that suits you. It retails for £595.00. That's not really too bad.  This would also be a great coat to pair with a dress, skirt or tights. I think that there is something really stylish about mixing prints. It also makes your body look great.  The best thing about this coat is that it is light enough to wear for walking around but still warm enough for a hot summer’s day. The jacket itself is white with grey splodges.

I like that this style is more relaxed.  There isn’t too much colour or too much fussy patterns. These clothes are quite simple. It would suit people with slightly more carefree personalities.

B2,"Given this story: SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. You'd probably agree that it is probably important to encourage and develop children's aptitude for music and performance. But what happens when your child shows this aptitude early on? What should be your response? When my daughter was three years old, she started playing piano at home. While she has progressed well over the past few years, she is still not a prodigy. Some of her notes may be slightly out of tune, while she sometimes gets carried away with the left hand and doesn't always practise the right hand as well. However, her music is always pleasant to listen to, which I'm sure has been the main consideration in developing her skills and interest in music. As I mentioned above, my daughter continues to play in a group setting and we have taken her to a music festival with other children her age. We have also taken her to a conservatoire to explore different sounds, types of music and techniques. The other thing we have done to support her music is to buy her a home-based ""music instrument"", which has been a great help in encouraging her in her studies and allowing her to enjoy playing in a musical setting without having to rely on an adult for the right notes and technique. What would you advise to your child? When do you think she should take a formal music lesson? Is there an age limit? Are there any other rules you would like us to follow for her?  Do you have any advice for parents.

C1,"Given this story: Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country says Georgina Ferry but she is little known For the past four years I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. When the last of the human race is wiped out, the story of Dorothy Hodgkin and her invention of the flu vaccine will be studied in the same class as that of Darwin and Darwinian theory. And it's a story worth telling to young people - it shows us what human beings are capable of achieving when we work together. Hodgkin was born in Kent in 1897, one of six children of a coal miner and his wife. Her sister, Margaret, became a professional chemist. Her father worked in the pits at Dartford during the wars, but moved the family to the village of Rotherfield when they were safe again. Hodgkin went to an all-girls school in nearby Ashford. She excelled at English, and was soon teaching it to children in the local village. Then she set about devising and building her own chemistry set. She won a scholarship to Exeter when she was 16, but she also had a year studying medicine at Reading, then she joined a chemistry club. She also learned how to make her own equipment. In 1928, with a friend she started a company which sold chemicals and laboratory equipment, but she was so busy that she never told anyone she was studying medicine. Two months after she graduated, while she was working on a project in the laboratory, she developed what turned out to be an infectious disease, a severe chest infection. She had to stop, and was given several weeks' sick leave. That.

In January 2007, Janson was the victim of a failed art theft in London's West End while walking along a pavement during her lunch hour. She heard a voice calling her by her name, and when she turned around, two men in a black van had robbed her of her work. One of the men had been holding a pistol in his right hand. When she asked him what he wanted, he said ""Everything."" He then fled the scene in the van. Sarah Janson's paintings can cost up to £20,000 ($30,000) and she now holds four of them in her home. ""I've lost more in art than I've gained,"" she jokes. Janson, who has had work displayed in numerous art exhibitions and fairs worldwide, says she can't sleep, can't eat properly and is unable to concentrate on her normal work. She says the crime has left her traumatised and she feels angry and vulnerable at the way she felt she was targeted. She told the BBC's Today programme ""There are no words that can describe how this feels and what it does to you. I feel very vulnerable. I feel very angry at how I felt I was vulnerable. I felt threatened, and then being able to understand this is a form of art, that I am a thief and it was for me a form of art.""

Janson's paintings are based on her real life. The work, a series of pictures, is designed to create the illusion of real objects, such as a portrait of a friend, with an elaborate backdrop which seems to have been deliberately manipulated to add the illusion of realism.

In a feat of considerable literary skill the author has created a world with its own history traditions and customs. Tristan Smith is an average man who wakes one day to find himself an alien in the body of a professional secret agent. In a story of far-fetched events and high adventure, Smith must confront his own inner conflicts, as well as a ruthless KGB who wants him dead. The central theme of human relationships is explored through many complex and interesting characters, including a police chief, an evil spy, an alien, and a young, beautiful woman with a tragic past. The story is told with Smith’s narration.  As the main character, Tristan Smith, I had to speak a lot; a lot of my dialogues are directly spoken out to the reader; in fact, the majority of the characters are. I believe I succeeded in bringing out the atmosphere of the story, though it was difficult. I think the book’s main weakness is its repetitive structure. I sometimes found it rather boring, but I tried to write a lot to bring variety and change the pace, and not to repeat the same dialogue.

Out of the blue Hakan Hardenberger the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world’s trumpet-players today. In the year 2000, the trumpet became Hakan Hardenberger’s personal weapon. All musicians with an open mind and open mind alone, were invited by him to form the nucleus of “Hakan Hardenberger and the Jazz-Orchestra”. And as the group developed further, the musicians became the foundation of this unique entity: the so called “Hakan Hardenberger Trio”. A little later the Jazz-Orchestra has joined them. Hakan Hardenberger’s career began in the early 90’s, and since then the trumpeter has had very busy and varied activities with different bands and soloists. He has appeared on record, concert platforms, radio and TV programmes. He has performed with leading jazz-bands as “Jazz-Orchestral”, “Jazz-Orchester Leipzig”, “Zentral-Jazzband Dresden”, “Cappella Sinfonica Veneziana”, “Wußweiler Kammerorchester”, as well as with the European Jazz Band. But he also found the time for writing a book, “Canta & Sonnenschein”, which deals with the history of brass instruments. The book was written from the angle of a student of trumpet-classics, and it is an extremely interesting book, which every musician, no matter.

We asked five journalists to check out some of the places that are available. A. HENLOW GRANGE I welcomed the opportunity to go to Henlow Grange for six days as I was tired and needed to relax. I was there because I was worried about a toothache (unnecessary fear as a result of the experience), but I had a really relaxing, well-earned and very well-needed break. The staff are friendly, the food delicious, the atmosphere welcoming and relaxed, and they know the benefits of massages from aromatherapy to a cold water soak. My parents have used it for 40 years, and I've taken my dad for years. I know what a relief a long massage is - I'd recommend it to anyone who feels overworked or stressed out. It's a five-minute drive from Whetstone, about 15 minutes' walk from the train station (on the platform where the coach stops) and there's a small restaurant and refreshment room at the end of a winding driveway.  In addition to the spa treatment rooms and the indoor swimming pool, there are two separate gyms and a steam room in the house. The hotel is also open all year for those seeking respite from winter.  The best part about it is there are no other guests - it's as much a part of the countryside as the house itself, and I felt so relaxed that I slept well for the first time for ages.  You can go on a guided tour and visit the manor house (from April to October), or go for a more private stay in the bedrooms, which range from the smaller rooms in the garden cottage to the grand rooms in the.

It was a battle of kindness. ‘Emma’s waiting to talk to you, Monsieur Charles,’ cried Miss Havisham. ‘I’ll take that letter, and then you’d better go, or I shall feel as if I were intruding!’ Charles took no notice of this suggestion. He opened the letter, and the next moment was talking in a loud voice with Emmeline about his engagement to her. His manner was most deferential and even tender. He did not seem to notice her surprise when she said, ‘You know I’m not married?’ ‘No, I thought you were, for you said, “No, we must be married,”--and then “Now you’ll let me try to persuade you.”’ ‘I was only thinking of the effect on you. And I thought it might give you some relief to talk about it, for I wanted to do so with you. I mean you didn’t give me a chance to persuade you?’ She looked at him, and began to laugh. He was very proud and would not have been touched, she knew, had she laughed. ‘No, no! I only meant that I wanted to see you try.’ ‘Thank you,’ he said. ‘I think it was very kind of you.

C1,"Given this story: Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work. A. What makes a good leader? A leader is one who inspires an agent of change a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better as the early theorists believed. A successful leader is one who creates a culture that allows for change. Culture is about the way of life within an organisation. It is all about how people see each other, how they act and how they communicate. If you don’t have a great culture, you will lack the key ingredients of an effective leader. You can’t force others to accept or adopt new ways of working without setting the right cultural environment. You need a culture where individuals are free to innovate and risk taking. You also need a culture that supports the creation of new ideas and new ways of working. Your culture has an important impact on your individual as well as your team’s success. Everyone in your organisation needs to understand that culture is important and the need to develop and shape it. If a group’s culture is not working, don’t assume that it is the individual who is the problem. Rather, take a step back and look at your own actions and behaviours, you may have contributed to the problems in the culture by not challenging the status quo. 1. Recognise that culture is a collaborative process. Culture cannot just be created by one person or in one team, it takes a lot of work. The best leaders take ownership of developing the culture and make everyone in the organisation feel included in the process. Leaders have to recognise that their own personal feelings and beliefs are irrelevant. Instead, they have to focus on making sure the culture is.

A. Career Power is something that a lot of people try hard to achieve. A career should be something that makes people happy. Career power is not something you can buy, you can only have it if you want to have it. Career power is what sets a person apart from the others, and in a positive way. Career power is something that makes people want to do their best at work. A career should also enable people to live a fulfilling and meaningful life away from work. The more a person earns and the more their career is respected, the more they have career power.

It is not only about money and status but also about making a difference and making a name for oneself. What is career power, then? Career power is defined as the ability to drive one’s own career by means of personal ambition, self-awareness, perseverance, hard work, talent and good fortune. 

Good career choices are one of the keys to career power. The most successful people have chosen the right career and are not afraid to change if that's what it takes to achieve a better career.

Success in a career depends on a combination of talent, effort, determination, luck, and sometimes on circumstances beyond your control. A career can be a rollercoaster of highs and lows. Some people get used to it and enjoy their work, others do not. There is no single"

Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? The Best Clock radio for Bed You’re probably sitting there wondering what the point of a clock radio is? The truth is, as much as your device is meant to keep track of time, a clock radio can also help you wake up in the mornings. Your alarm may be loud enough for you to hear it in the night. However, when you wake up, you might not be fully aware of what time it is. If you have a clock radio, you can hear your alarm clock ringing in the other room before you even get out of bed. This helps ensure you don’t miss your alarm, and you can get right out of bed to start your day. Most clock radios also include a small speaker, so you can easily listen to an alarm clock radio to go off when you get up in the morning. There are many different features available when it comes to clock radios. Some include FM radio, the ability to set a particular song as the alarm, and even the ability to create a special alarm for a specific time. Once you buy a clock radio for bed, your next concern will be choosing what features will work for you. Consider your needs: Do you want a radio with a speaker? Will you be wearing headphones as you drift off to sleep? If not, will you have trouble hearing the alarm when you get up? How loud do you need your alarm to be? If.

It was summer for half the year in Britain and winter for another half. One of the reasons we went there was that the school I studied at was the first in the country to do a full course in permaculture, so the school grounds were very naturally planned. Some of the students went down in the winter to work in Australia in a banana plantation. On one of my visits down to visit my family, I went down to the grounds with them and saw how it worked. It was a fantastic idea. There was a whole lot of fruit growing there.  The New Zealand student came back and did a course on permaculture in the same place. The next summer we set off for New Zealand. The reason I tell this story is that the course was on the basis of ecological design. That was an unusual idea at the time, but it has been adopted by many people. We went down to the school’s grounds at the beginning of the course. It was a very simple permaculture course. We looked at the land and made a map of it, laid down our plans of how it should be developed. We then went down to look for native plants and ferns and things that would work in that environment. We took the plants we chose back to Britain. Then we spent the rest of the year living in a way that.

Our emphasis is on travel to new and unusual destinations coupled with interesting and original itineraries.      Our small group tours leave a few footprints on the landscape. This means we are mindful of the landscape we are working in, respect local people, treat the land with respect, learn from the people we interact with and leave a trace in the places we visit.      Most of our small group trips are based on the premise that our journey is less about getting to a destination and more about the way we get there. This ethos has made us pioneers in creating tailor-made trips and adventures.      We believe that small groups provide more personal and unique experiences, more chance of meeting local people and more opportunity to enjoy and take part in more diverse activities. This approach to travel means you can experience the country and the culture as it should be experienced, and will leave a less damaging footprint.      We believe in getting the best value from our trips. We set high standards for ourselves in respect of food, accommodation, facilities and the way we interact with local people.      Whether you are exploring the world around you or seeing it through new eyes on one of our tailor-made trips, you will get the quality we are known.

Women's sports are under-represented in news. The few articles in the media that mention women athletes are often about athletics, rather than women in the news in general or sports in general. The most recent article (as of November 9, 2009) about a woman athlete in the news was The Secret Life of Sportsmen by Chris Barrie.  The first sports article that mentioned women in the news was ""New York Times"" by Elizabeth A. Behar on April 21, 1971: ""The Women's March"". This was followed by three other similar articles in that week on April 21, 21, and 28, 1971. The two previous articles concerned a World Championship for Women's High Jump, and the other article was about the New York YMCA League Women's World Tennis Championship.    Many women are known to be better than the men, though this article was not written to specifically talk about women's sports (but was about the lack of attention on women's sports in general, as was this one). For example, the men's Olympic basketball team won the gold in Athens, and the men's tennis team won.

The boy just wasn’t social. He lived in his own world and the world of animals was too much to take in.      His story was heartbreaking, which is why I took him in and cared for him.

Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm into an ‘open farm’ six years ago we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. We took them in and fed them, washed them and gave them love and support. We had a special room called the ‘orphan room’ where they could live in peace away from the world and where we could get to them and take good care of them.      All the animals were very frightened and were crying. All we could do was to try and keep them calm and quiet, then get them out of there as soon as possible.      In a short space of time they became friendly, relaxed and relaxed.      One of the lads was particularly close to the dog who would sit by the doorway where it was easiest for the boy to rub against him.      This boy’s name was Tommy.      He would sit by the doorway for hours watching the dog and the rest of us.      If you ever see a Labrador Retriever looking a little apprehensive, there is an easy way to know why – Tommy.      The boy just wasn’t social. He lived in his own world"
C1,"Given this story: DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. We've been doing book reviews in print for nearly 150 years, so it is no surprise that publishers recognise the role that book reviews can play in helping readers decide whether to buy a book.  It's also no surprise that publishers would like to know how their books are being reviewed - they want to find out how the book is being described by the people who most regularly review books. Booksellers are another group to whom book reviewers owe their livelihoods, so it seems sensible that book reviewers want to know what booksellers are saying about their books. So, as the new year approaches and we look forward to reading the best books of 2015, it seems only logical that we try to find out what booksellers are saying about them.  What happens when a publisher or bookseller makes a negative review public? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said.  In many ways, book reviewers have it easier than booksellers because their reviews are not part of an entire book being put on sale, but they have some of the same problems. Booksellers have to deal with books from publishers whose books are currently out of print or whose booksellers' stocks are low - which means that if booksellers are unimpressed, the booksellers' accounts may suffer. Book reviewers are more likely to use their reviews to talk about a book they want to see more.

C1,"Given this story: WEATHERVANE MAKER THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham’s designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. Weathervanes are a traditional and much-loved British landscape feature that stand in the path of the wind and rain so that no rain drops or gusts of wind blow over the house. Weathervanes are often cast in cast iron but are also now available in a wide range of materials like zinc, brass or stainless steel. Graham’s handcrafted designs are a great choice for many of our customers. Graham Smith is a London-based traditional craftsman and craftswoman. She makes elegant, handmade weathervanes using a traditional method. The hand-cutting process Graham used is a skill dating back to the earliest forms of agriculture. It is also one of the few remaining “trade-crafts” in the country. In recent years, the craft of weathervanes has become hugely popular, with many of the features of Graham’s work now being replicated in cast iron. The Weathervane is an important feature in any landscape because it keeps rain and wind away from the house and stops it being blown down the driveway. The Weathervane has a traditional association with the English countryside, often serving as a kind of boundary marker or boundary wall for farms or farms. The Weathervane is an essential feature in most gardens because it prevents rain from running off and damage the lawn. To find out more about Graham’s work, please contact her.

There were statues all around, each one was made of gold and gems. Graham loved magic and magic liked him back. His mansion was big enough that you could drive a train through it. It had a secret cellar with a magic weathervane on top of it. Every morning this weathervane would turn and it was a beautiful sight. Sometimes a giant dove would swoop down to catch it and eat the bread from Graham’s table. Graham was a famous magician who even wanted to make his stage bigger but it was not possible. But he was a man who loved magic and sometimes he wished that the door that led to his magic shop had a magic lock. He wished that if his staff arrived at the door they could not open the door and that it would only open if Graham unlocked it and turned the handle. He wished that the magic door would close every day and remain closed until he unlocked it and turned the handle. He wished for many things but most importantly he wished that he had a magic weathervane on top of his mansion. It would be like a magic carpet that he could ride on when he performed his magic tricks.

I was afraid that this secret meeting could not be of any benefit to me. However, as soon as I had finished telling Mr Jaggers what was expected of me, he asked me to remain in his office. He then told me to sit down. I knew that there were a number of factors which could determine whether or not I would be asked to undertake this task.

Ten miles south of the equator a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. In his early 20s, Richard Nerurkar was one of Britain's top ten thousand metre runners. Then a combination of injuries and depression took hold. It was the time of his life in London, an elite life where he won titles and trained hard, but his mental health deteriorated. The stress of losing all those big races, his self-doubt, the constant scrutiny, all took its toll. After failing to qualify for the World Championships, and with his coach and business manager both quitting, he packed his bags, drove to the outskirts of London and ended up in a rundown hotel room, watching telly. There was just one thing: he wanted to win those big races. The hotel staff had to tell him to go to bed at midnight. That he had reached what he regarded as a nadir. Richard's problem is far from rare. Mental health is a taboo topic in sport. There have been numerous studies in the past three years revealing the extent to which sporting stars are suffering depression. Mental illness is so prevalent in sports - including football, rugby, tennis, cricket, golf and so on - that a professional athlete has been reported to police for having suicide threats. The problem with sport is that it is a solitary environment, which means there is no one there to offer support.

C1,"Given this story: THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should combine old and new says Tom Cunliffe. And he put it into practice in his own craft 'The Westerman'. This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. When he set out to design his boat in 1999, the designer who goes by the name of Tom Cunliffe was confronted with a range of options. The old way of making boats was still dominant. The old way of designing them was old-fashioned. New ways of working with wood or steel were slow and tedious. The most promising new technique seemed to be to use aluminium. But aluminium was too heavy, so the designer had to look for an alloy that was light and strong enough. One of the best elements of the hull shape revolution is that aluminium has now become a widely used material, and that a huge range of colours is available. Tom Cunliffe's boat is, in fact, one of the first that uses aluminium for the hull only. Other boats that have used aluminium in this way are now common enough. The key thing about a yacht hull is that it is made from the same material as a car's chassis. One of the greatest joys of a cruise on a modern superyacht is that you no longer have to worry about the boat's maintenance. The yacht carries a team of maintenance engineers who fix everything from rudder bearings to windsurfing decks. But on a cruising yacht you can be forgiven for thinking that the hull is something that happens on the outside, to be treated with the same care as the superstructure. But, even as the boats grow more like cars, the hull retains its function as a container for the superstructure. As.

C1,"Given this story: Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards. As a hedgehog lies on its back it can remain completely hidden from predators, for example a bird. Hedgehogs do this by flattening their bodies. As a hedgehog lies on its back the spines of the hind feet point downwards and the back legs point up. This gives the impression that the animal has many legs. This behaviour helps hedgehogs to remain hidden from predators. This is an important part of the hedgehog's defence against the predators, as the prey animals, such as reptiles and birds, mistake the hedgehog for a prey animal. Another defence the hedgehog uses against predators is it use the ""huff and puff"" method. They puff up their fur so that it resembles a puff of smoke. This gives the hedgehog the impression that it is very large. Hedgehogs have excellent eyesight, which they use to hunt. They are omnivorous animals and eat anything from insects to mammals to reptiles, and amphibians. A hedgehog might only use a tiny part of its snout and throat for scent gathering while hunting, the rest of its body is covered in sharp spines, known as spurs, which are used for cutting through the soft plant and animal tissues of its prey. Hedgehogs do not have true teeth but they do have special spurs that are useful in cutting through prey materials. The spurs have tiny prongs that are used to penetrate, crush and break down plant and animal tissues. The hedgehog will then.

Output the generated story directly. Hedgehogs are mammals that have no true teeth but have sharp, pronged spurs which can be used to cut through their prey materials. They can also puff up their fur to give the impression of size. These traits can be useful in the wild as the prey animals mistake a hedgehog for a member of their own kind, so they are less likely to fear it.  The hedgehog also uses the puffing up defence, in which it creates smoke that gives it the impression of size. To add to their defence, a hedgehog also rolls into a small ball. This helps it to remain hidden from predators. They also have an excellent sense of smell. 
These defensive traits are particularly useful for a hedgehog as it is a small mammal. In the wild, hedgehogs are usually in the company of large mammals and they rely on the scent of their prey animals to find and identify them. This means they need to have a good sense of smell so they can accurately spot their prey and cut through the soft materials that make up it.
The hedgehog has a small number of teeth which it uses mainly for biting in the wild but these teeth have sharp edges that can inflict very painful bites. In the same way that a bird's beak is a good tool for eating, the hedgehog's spurs have the same purpose.  This means they are also very good at cutting through soft plant and animal matter.

Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Dr Toby Clark is aiming to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations, and the man behind Halley's comet. When Dr Toby Clark was five years old, his father took him into the countryside to show him a mystery. They found the body of a man they couldn't find the face of. ""My dad told me there was this boy who had been caught in the snow, but there was no face. And the boy had a map on his chest and he'd marked the way home from the dead man's place in the snow."" ""And then the boy got cold and he died. And I think Dad was trying to tell me that when you see something that's wrong you have to speak out about it."" Dr Clark says he felt he had to do the same thing with his search for ""true north"". The British Geological Survey scientist is retracing the quest of the first comet hunter, Sir Edmund Halley - but this time, it's not in the cold fields of England, but the hot and dry highlands of Pakistan.

Dr Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He is trying to retrace the steps of Sir Edmund Halley, the first astronomer to track compass variations.

""My dad took me out into the countryside,"" says Dr Clark, ""to show me a mystery. We found the body of a man, but we couldn't find his face. And the boy had a map on his chest and he'd marked the way home from the dead man's place in the snow. And then the boy got cold and he died. And I think Dad was trying to tell me that when you see something that's wrong you have to speak out about it.""

Dr Clark says he feels he has to do the same with his search for ""true north"". The British Geological Survey scientist is retracing the steps of the first comet hunter, Sir Edmund Halley. But this time, it's not in the cold fields of England, but in the hot, dry hills of Pakistan.

C1,"Given this story: Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott shares with his readers the mystical experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent: the Seven Summits. My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I will take them in the order of my climbing them. A. Mt. Mt. Elbrus, the highest point in Eastern Europe, is often described as the most beautiful mountain in Europe, but I had never climbed it, nor even seen it. Having just turned 60, and after a life of doing jobs that left me little time for any passion, it seemed like the time was right. On December 31, 2012, I left my home in San Diego, California, and took a 10-hour overnight train for Moscow, followed by a 2-day bus trip to Minsk, Belarus, to catch a flight to Kiev, then a 12-hour plane ride to Baku, Azerbaijan, and a 16-hour flight to Istanbul, Turkey, before arriving in Istanbul early the next morning. I rented a car and traveled south to the border town of Trabzon. There, I rented a motorcycle and started the 3-day trip to Elbrus. While the motorcycle would not have been good for the steep rocky roads that traverse the mountain, it was good for touring with friends who didn’t speak Russian well, as the motorcycle was one of those cars with a small trunk. I had never been on a motorcycle and found myself being towed along the narrow roads of Trabzon, with occasional stops for gas or to check out the sights. After passing through the border town of Aktau, I reached the border crossing into the Republic of North Ossetia, which is not recognized by the United Nations or Russia,.

We got off the bus and got on the metro. I was surprised to find the metro system in Moscow is similar to the London Underground. We entered the subway and the train was moving. After a while, we arrived at the station. It is a very large, well-manicured station. There were many beautiful women at the station.

A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations the photographer has to be conscious of actions gestures and expressions. Photographing People In the photography book Photographing People By John E. Krenz there are two photographs. The one on the left is a man having a cigarette. The one on the right is an empty chair. In both cases the photographer is using a wide angle lens and the subjects are about two metres apart.  The photograph on the left shows a man at work, the one on the right shows a person looking away. In both pictures the photographer has used the same type of wide angle lens which causes shadows to be cast across both the person and the chair.  The background has been chosen to match the colour of the man's trousers which is a lighter shade than the wall which they are sitting on. Also it has a pattern that is slightly darker than that of the room.  In both pictures the photographer has deliberately chosen dark colours for the room and clothes and this contrast against the lighter background makes both the man's and chair's colouring stand out against the background.  Photographing People In the second photograph the focus is on a person's eye and her eyelashes. The eye, which is not visible in the first picture, is a blue colour and the white lash is also blue.

C1,"Given this story: The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her in action. One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. This is the first of two mysteries, Hotel Inspector Sue Brown which I enjoyed immensely. If you like a cozy mystery and like to read about a woman who is a master at her job, I suggest you give this book a try. As in the previous book, “The Diners Club Case”, the story begins in an unexpected location, a hotel, where the inspector is conducting her annual inspection, where she looks for examples of poor maintenance, dirty rooms and other conditions that may be indicators of poor management. She is assisted in her job by her assistant Christopher Middleton who also does some of the work she finds herself unable to do. The inspection at the Globe Hotel begins on day one and carries on until day sixty-two. As is the case in the previous books, Brown does not have to work a full day due to the length of the inspections. On day fifty-four the inspector finds a number of room service bills, which would clearly be invalid under the terms of her contract. This is a small matter but it has to be pointed out since it has been done before and Brown has not given a new reason for her disallowance of the bills. After some back and forth with the manager, she is able to find a different room for the room service bills to be served. Day sixty-eight concludes with a visit to the reception desk at the hotel to see whether the same person is calling for room service during the time of inspection. The reception.

The next day she visits the reception desk to see whether the same person is calling for room service during the time of the inspections. The receptionist tells her that the desk clerk is not informed about the inspector’s visit. During the next day she visits a restaurant and sees a receipt with room service number on it. She also discovers the same person is in the restaurant. Then she sees the receptionist and the desk clerk sitting in the restaurant.   On her last day of the inspections she goes to the restaurant and confronts the staff. They tell her that the receptionist is informed that the inspector is coming. They also tell her that there is a small problem but it will be solved. The inspector thinks that the small problem could be solved but the inspector decides to leave the hotel and she returns to her office. The inspector tries to fix the small problem but the general manager shows up.  He informs the inspector that he has not decided on which room is a problem.

The employer then might well ask whether she is emotionally stable enough to take on the responsibility of dealing with customers. And even if she was emotionally stable, she still might not be the best candidate as she might be too empathetic and therefore too prone to making mistakes.

C1,"Given this story: Volunteer tourism Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. A. It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. “Voluntary work is not an object of charity but an act of self-sacrifice in the field of human development.” — William R. Broad      Voluntary work by people in international organizations or with NGOs is essential for improving human conditions in poor countries. According to the World Health Organization, 1 million of the 5 million new deaths in 2001 were preventable. That is why volunteerism in the field of global development is increasing. Volunteering by doctors and teachers can drastically reduce the death rate. In the field of water management and sanitation, volunteer work is a crucial resource, as volunteers provide expertise to developing countries.      Voluntary work in the field of international development can be divided into different types of volunteering. Each type offers the opportunity to meet people in another country, learn about their culture and customs, and develop a closer relationship with local people.      Volunteerism in education and healthcare is one of the most important types of international volunteer work, which plays an integral role in the process of development. The purpose of education and healthcare work is not only to provide skills and knowledge but also to provide people with emotional support. Volunteer doctors and nurses not only provide basic healthcare services to the needy but also play a role in the promotion of human values in people. In addition, volunteer nurses also teach new medical technologies to the local communities. This not only alleviates pressure on the healthcare system but also stimulates economic development in poorer countries.

C1,"Given this story: Science flying in the face of gravity Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964 a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. What looks like a giant piece of wood took off in weightlessness. Inside was the NASA-funded 'Newton Laboratory', a two-floor steel-tube aircraft with two engines mounted at the ends of its fuselage. Its walls are painted an eerie dark red to hide the fact that it is actually a full-sized research aircraft. Inside the cabin was a team of nine students, most of them just teenagers, and three senior staff from the University of Southampton, in Southampton, UK, which funded the flight.      It was meant to be their first successful weightless flight. Instead, it became a sort of flying scientific experiment, testing the effects of weightlessness on the human body and proving that some theories about the nature of gravity, like the ones advanced in the 1800s by British physicist Isaac Newton, can be tested in weightlessness.      As far as Newton was concerned, gravity wasn't something that acted in one direction. It was an acceleration caused by mass and nothing else, and that acceleration was due to gravity acting directly on every object, no matter how far apart they were.      However, some scientists argue that gravity, like the force that pulls a cup of tea toward your lips, is affected by the geometry of the object or body.      The students in the Newtons Laboratory, known as the 'Newtons Seven', took part in a series of experiments to find out if that is true.

For decades it was the only portrait I had made and I treasure it above my many more pictures.      I was not aware that Picasso was such a character. It certainly surprised me to see an ageing man enjoying a meal at an outdoor cafe. It was also an absolute shock to be seated next to one of the greatest artists of the century. He had no concept of personal space, only the illusion that he and his famous paintings and drawings were the only things that existed.      We had finished eating and Picasso, clearly bored, began to sketch and draw us. In an hour he had created 15 drawings. I sat enthralled, as he explained the different characteristics of his famous girls, each with their own story. He talked of all the different moods and thoughts he could evoke in his girls.      He also began to talk.

Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide.

If a woman sees an ad for a pair of panty hose, the likelihood is higher than her being in a crowded store looking for panty hose. She has learned something about the product and the price is likely to be right. Advertising can even increase the likelihood of people being in the store.

Many studies have shown that advertising is a good tool. Why is advertising still so successful? If we want to make the ad's impact stronger, and the impact of advertising be more powerful, we have to change the way we think about advertising. If you believe a negative advertising message about an item you are thinking about buying, it may be very effective. The more strongly you feel the negative message, the greater its impact.

Suddenly the hens weren't on their game - it was all a bit fidgety and nervous. So the peacocks started strutting, and suddenly the hens were up to it. They all jumped into the air, one after the other, and all their feathers were standing straight up. I was just standing there, dumbstruck, transfixed by this display of aerial grace. I think the peacocks know we're watching and that makes them feel really good - they don't have to pretend. The hens have won their own little war of the sexes.

On this grand evolutionary scale whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. And yet we can make great differences in the time it takes for our minds to do something. When we get together with a group of people we can invent a language in a matter of hours, and even the most limited number of humans working together can create a vast number of new tools, both physical and intellectual. The most extraordinary examples of this happen during the development of musical skills. You can start to play a musical instrument within hours and you can learn to read music within a few days. This is incredible when you think about it. A complete new human brain being created in just a matter of days, when previously a complete human brain would take years if not decades to form. And this is not just limited to musical ability; there are many other areas in which there is a dramatic difference between humans and other animals. We have the ability to think critically, make decisions and form opinions, which is not the case for most animals. We can also experience emotion like a human being, and therefore we can have a sense of humour, and make jokes, which is not the case for many of the other animals. We also have the ability to become physically stronger, and the ability to control what happens in our bodies when we move. In short, we can form new aspects of ourselves quickly and completely depending on what we are doing.

He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy. Chris Bonnington and Robin Knox-Johnston are two of Britain’s most accomplished mountaineers but you would be forgiven for thinking they were brothers – they look so much alike. They first met back in 1985 when they were both climbing the world’s highest peaks. Since then they have gone on to scale Everest eight times, as well as several high altitude summits and records. When they finally reached the top of the world in 2013, they became the oldest and third oldest people to reach the peak – just two months older than Austrian Peter Baer and his guide, who also reached the summit together. They are both world class mountaineers and experienced climber but what makes them even more special is the fact they do this while living in the UK. They do not live in the mountains and rarely leave the UK but, thanks to the UK government’s visa scheme, are able to work as expedition organisers. This means they are free to climb and train up some of the world’s most challenging mountains and, for them, work can help fund the next adventure. They both joined the UK National Mountaineering Centre in the mid-1980s and have risen to become among Britain’s most accomplished mountaineers.

C1,"Given this story: Chewing gum culture It’s fashionable classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day. Discover how an ancient custom became big business. Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. This summer, the latest fashion in chewing gum emerged from the world of luxury products. In May, L’Oreal launched Vio, the first in a line of new, “luxury,” gums with “luxury” packaging. The “luxury” line’s gum, $14.95 for 20 sticks, looks like the sort that a high-net-worth family would use to impress the neighbor kids when they were in fifth grade. In the packaging, a woman’s leg is shown at a slight angle while chewing a Vio stick.      One can’t blame Vio’s sales from this packaging approach. In the U.S., chewing gum sales have exploded in the past decade, to more than $3.6 billion. Some of this rise, of course, is attributable to our appetite for new flavors; more than 60 new flavors of gum now are available. But most is due to the way gums have made the mainstream a more civilized place for chewing.      Chewing gum is a great way to relax. It’s not quite like blowing one’s nose, because it’s not related to that bodily function. It’s more like blowing a bubble, which takes the place of the nose when a person is stressed.      For many people, there is something satisfying about the way.

C1,"Given this story: THEATRE CHARLES SPENCER A. Tamburlaine the Great Marlowe’s ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands’ staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe’s play with an exhilarating speed and physicality. Marlowe’s marvellous, self-regarding fool Marston is played by Stephen Tompkinson with a comic charisma that gives his antics the effect of a fickle wind, a constant change of direction. His rival, Sir John Marston (Mark Bonnar), also a master swordsman, has a better cast of accomplices: the smooth and amiable Puck (Jonathan Miller), the sly and shifty Oberon (Richard Durden), and the ever-delightful Titania (Annabelle Apsion). The four of them and the equally wise and shrewd Porson (Bryony Kimmings) turn a single wager into a multi-million-pound enterprise, the principal characters in the enterprise being Puck and Titania, who, along with Porson, is Puck’s long-suffering, ever-vulnerable lady love.      This is a production by Richard Jones, who has brought us the great Gilbert and Sullivan operetta and the magnificent production of Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible”. As with “The Crucible”, there is an atmosphere of fear, even paranoia, a feeling of foreboding as the play moves back and forth between the late 1600s in which it is set and the late 1700s. There are hints of the terror of the Puritan era in the atmosphere. The play is the story.

A very long, very slow first hour drags, but after that things pick up, with a memorable last chase scene. A film, with its two distinct halves, must make a powerful impression for the viewer to remain with it until the end. For this director, Richard Attenborough, there was no doubt that his was a good film. On a good day Attenborough, who also wrote the script, was a leading creative force behind some of the great cinema of the 20th century. Here was a good story and a well-acted, if not great, cast who were well supported by a number of talented, if occasionally ill-used, actors (I'm thinking, first and foremost, of Michael Gambon). There is one particular moment when, after what has happened to Bud, the final credits are displayed, which is absolutely heartbreaking. Of all the films Attenborough had directed prior to Titanic, this one had always been considered the most important of his career and, it must be said, he hadn't let himself down. Titanic is the longest movie of all time. Some critics have argued that this is one of the biggest mistakes ever made by a major studio. But to argue that Titanic is not a great movie is to argue that you have a fundamentally flawed definition of what constitutes a great movie. A lot of critics talk about whether the ship hits the iceberg (an improbable event). They talk about what happens inside the boat.

He had to swim for his life to get out of the car. It had gone terribly wrong. After he finished the test, his girlfriend dumped him, and he had to be at the lake the next day at 10am. But his friend John told him not to worry and to calm down, because he himself also had a big test that day as well. He too had to swim to get out of his car. After they finished the tests, they took a bus to the city. Their boss called them all in and told them that they were fired. John asked Bob if he needed anything and they told him that they would meet at the lake after the test on Thursday.

C1,"Given this story: The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. As he works on a sofa, Hurst lifts a leg and bends it in several different directions, creating a sense of movement and action. As he works, his face is almost as alive as the thing he is carving. He has a light-blue scowl which seems almost impossible to escape. When I point out he may be in pain, he gives a sheepish grin and says he is not. Hurst, 75, doesn't suffer from arthritis and doesn't take any drugs. He lives alone in his small house in a suburb of London, and says his main concern in life is making furniture that pleases its owners. He has been carving since he was 11, when his father gave him his first chair to make after watching him work for three days.      'I was in heaven, my dad was in heaven,' he says. 'They had both seen me at my very, very best.' His father, a blacksmith, encouraged him to become a cabinet-maker and took him to showrooms. 'He was my mentor, he taught me everything that I knew. My father was a great craftsman.' In 1962, when he was 34, he set up on his own and moved to a purpose-built, 19th-century shop on the London road. The shop was well known for its excellent carpentry and furniture design, but the work was very low-key, as Hurst mostly dealt with wealthy people.   .

C1,"Given this story: Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain’s most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises. The first is Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral Southwell Minster celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. It turns out the house’s most environmentally-friendly feature is not the absence of electricity or even of hot water, but, rather, the lack of doors. Built in the 14th century, the Minster is remarkable as one of the few surviving English cathedrals to have remained largely unchanged throughout the medieval era and into the Reformation. Its stone pillars, with their centuries-old carvings, are as beautiful and haunting as ever. Yet in keeping with its age, this part of Nottinghamshire has few modern conveniences. The Minster is therefore a rare oasis of conservation and quiet in a modern city. We pull up outside the Minster and Charles leads me into the oldest part of the building, the Chapter House, where we meet the cathedral librarian, Anne, and Anne’s younger brother, James, the librarian’s nephew. He has been doing his homework here before classes and after exams. Anne seems a warm and thoughtful lady – we talk for hours about the history and architecture of the Minster. Her house, which she lives in with her daughter and son-in-law, has no carpets – they have felt floors. And there’s no electricity. The old librarian’s daughter also lives in the Minster and brings their laundry. The building’s great hall is used for conferences, classes, weddings and funerals.

The image of freshness Supermarkets know from their market research that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. So you were tempted to buy more than you intended to. You were on your way home from the store, ready to eat your homemade lasagna for dinner when you heard it. That groan of disgust coming from your refrigerator. A fresh bag of spinach that’s only a day old. Or that ripe strawberries you forgot to buy. The sales force at your supermarket knows that it’s impossible to stop a shopper from shopping. So in order to keep us buying what we want, supermarkets employ a number of strategies to get us to the check-out. 1. The most obvious way to lure you back to the produce section is with the bright and early arrival of fruit and vegetables. The morning paper is often filled with pictures of the new and exciting produce found in the early morning hours. The idea being that fresh produce tastes better when its still young. The earliest strawberries, for example, are the sweetest and juiciest. It’s also why many fruits and vegetables (berries, berries and more berries) are often featured in newspaper ad inserts before noon. It’s also why there are often advertisements about shopping early in the week or mid-week. You know you’re more likely to see a picture of a salad or a freshly picked fruit on a Wednesday than a bag of chocolate chip cookies. 2. Produce sales are a big driver of sales at supermarkets. As such, you see more and more signs.

You suddenly hear the word “no” from the cashier.
“There isn’t enough for all of you,” she said.

She pointed a thin finger at you, telling you that you have to wait your turn, even though you were just coming over to get the milk you had just placed on the shelves, a few minutes ago.

The cashier, looking down at you, was wearing a frown. She had expected you to be the only one who wanted milk that time.

She put her hands into her pockets, and sighed. “It seems that, you, along with all the other customers, can’t stand the fact that we can only store such a small amount of product.

But why do you think the supermarket put up such a limit?

I can guarantee you, if we allowed everyone to shop on a first-come-first-serve basis, everyone would come back again and again to buy more of this product.

Besides, it’s against the law to sell something that’s not available for purchase.

You would lose customers, and the sales of the milk would fall.

So, what would you do?

C1,"Given this story: Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. Sleep plays a crucial role in many life processes such as the growth of embryos, healing wounds and the formation of muscle and tissue. But the role of sleep in our everyday lives is still shrouded in mystery, say scientists who are still far from agreeing about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. They are also not certain why sleep seems to fall out of our lives so suddenly, overnight, when it is usually a gradual process, according to the latest research published in the journal Nature. In a study of more than 800,000 participants in 18 countries, British scientists from the Royal United Services Institute said a healthy sleep quality was crucial for healthy mental and physical performance, as well as physical and mental recovery. For example, they found that inadequate sleep at night resulted in lower performance on short-term memory tests. The researchers also looked at data from more than 200,000 people in the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Poland and Japan over a period of 16 years. One theory put forward by the team of experts at the RUSI’s Sleep and Health Research Lab is that people can find sleep challenging at the best of times, and that when they are in a stressful situation or experiencing high levels of anxiety or stress, they struggle even more with sleep. However, the study also found that people’s sleep quality is also influenced by the amount of caffeine that they drink in the day. “We found that individuals.

C1,"Given this story: Is your office working ok? Fresh air and the right chairs are the key to a happy healthy workforce according to a new survey. We went to four contrasting offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist who studies people’s working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. A new survey has found that the key to a healthy office is getting rid of the furniture and hiring in more people who are sitting on exercise bikes and standing desks. The poll, carried out by Office Magazine, found that the ideal workplace had been described as “bright, clean, well-ventilated and well-stocked” by 58 per cent of workers while 35 per cent found their workplaces “crowded” and 44 per cent described the environment as “stuffy and smelly”. But what does this mean for employers? The Office Magazine poll found that 42 per cent of the 1,000 workers who took part thought their bosses “did not seem to know what good health means” and almost a third believed that their workplace could have made them ill. Over half of the workers (59 per cent) thought their employers were not making a commitment to health and well-being and the findings indicate that, while a vast majority of workers want to feel fit, healthy and happy at work, only 27 per cent of employers feel the same. To make sure that both employers and workers were making the right choices, the Office Magazine survey included four different environments; “well-ventilated and well-stocked” (40 per cent), “crowded but neat” (30 per cent), “stuffy and smelly” (30 per cent) and “overcrowded.

And he is sitting there and he is typing on his computer and he is wearing glasses. And he is looking at the monitors and he is typing away and he isn’t feeling well so he doesn’t go to the doctors. In the morning he has a coffee and he is fine. I suppose what I am trying to say is that he needs fresh air and he needs chairs that he can sit in. The other thing is that he needs the exercise bike and he needs the standing desk. All the other things that are going on in the office, those don’t need to happen there and it doesn’t cause sickness. There is plenty of fresh air and there is plenty of exercise and there is plenty of sitting around that can be done in the open-plan space. I have to say, this is one of the least healthy offices I have ever seen. The exercise bike and the standing desk are just for show. He sits there typing on the computers for hours and hours and he doesn’t really feel well and then at the end of the day he is tired. He needs to see the doctor. He needs to go for a walk, and he needs to get up and he needs to exercise. If he is sitting at his desk, he will probably get ill, so he needs to walk around the office and move around and see the things"

C1,"Given this story: THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING I thought everyone would be pleased but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. ‘What do you mean?’ she raged. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day life-long smoker and four hours later I was not was faintly irritating. I found out the hard way that the only people who care if you stop smoking are other smokers. Everyone else just wants you to live long and healthy. It is very hard to explain to the public why it’s not just about the money but, as a human being, it’s nice knowing you are in control of your life. If I was a smoker I would love it if everyone could have it sorted like I have. To give up is difficult but, as I always say to people, it’s the easiest thing I’ve done in my life. When I first stopped I couldn’t eat anything without wanting a cigarette. It took me a while to figure out what I was supposed to do without smoking – I wasn’t supposed to like anything any more. When I first quit I felt like I had to tell people how to be a smoker; I couldn’t stand it. Now I have more fun, meet people with interesting opinions, and find people who know what they are talking about – which is what I wanted in the first place. The hardest part of quitting was the first week. But you get through it and it gets easier with the next few weeks. If you can make it through week one, you can get through anything. My advice would be to make it a personal challenge. If you set yourself a time limit you will do it. But I think it’s more likely you will.

C2,"Given this story: Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. There's a great deal to be said for the old adage ""There are many things that a man can do, but only one man can do everything."" It's true that many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. There was a great shortage of charts and catalogues in the 1960s and 1970s. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. But astronomy is changing fast. More and more people are interested in astronomy and the latest technology helps keep them in the game. To say that amateur astronomy is growing is an understatement. While astronomical research was once a solitary pursuit for the true amateur, today the internet and social media have opened the door to a world of astronomy learning and sharing. Many amateur astronomers are now involved with university student research programs and are studying the planets and solar systems, as well as studying the sky with binoculars and telescopes. While professional astronomers are still the world leaders in astronomy research and many of these stars will be visible to the unaided eye in the near future (perhaps not with the power and precision of, say, a planet-seeker telescope, but certainly with a small backyard telescope), astronomy has now spread to a much wider audience.

Art is praised in terms of being unique revolutionary shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago.

You can make a judgment call of whether someone has done something that you would like to do. You can have a sense of what makes something interesting and fun, in terms of art or anything else. (In fact, you can already do this today, by looking up other artists who are similar to the artists you admire, and making a judgment call based on how they do their thing.  If you want a specific artist's specific style, you can look up the paintings they used in their work.) This has always been true of art, but it's become even more true in recent years. In the past, if you wanted to appreciate something, you had to have something to look at.  Today, you can appreciate a painting without even having a painting to look at!  If you see something you think is beautiful, you can appreciate it without knowing it's the work of someone who is considered one of the greats of history, and without knowing that you'll see an almost identical style of paintings if you go back hundreds of years.

C2,"Given this story: Fashion Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point. The earliest known reference to clothing as a form of expression dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Fashioning ritual clothing, such as burial clothes, has been part of humanity’s cultural fabric for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian clothing, which were often decorated with symbolic figurines and patterns, were probably inspired by the fashion of the day. In ancient Greece, clothing played an important role in civic culture and in the rituals of the temple. Clothing was an intrinsic part of social ritual. Even the earliest known Greek fashion statement, the kylix, had a symbolic meaning. Greek designers were concerned with the appearance of the kylix and incorporated a flower into the emblem of the kylix, a sign that the garment was appropriate for a special day. During the Classical period, Athenian fashion was influenced by Rome. The Greeks adopted many Roman styles and fashions, and this influence is still apparent in many styles of today. In Sparta, the use of colors and patterns was banned in favor of a strict and sober style of dress that was associated with virtue. In Rome, women wore gowns called chemise. While the term chemise has come to be synonymous with corsets, the term chemise was first used to describe the lower part of a gown or dress. Chemise is also one of the origins of the term corsetry, referring to a kind of gown with an underskirt, which is another form of.

C2,"Given this story: Metals It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. The story of how the development of tools and metals, and even the invention of fire, happened is one that has been debated by archaeologists since the dawn of humanity.  One interpretation is that as our ancestors were developing tools and creating new ways of making and heating food, they began to mine for precious metals that were not as readily available as those found on the Earth today, such as gold and copper. For this, you only needed to search a riverbed. This notion has been supported by finds of bronze, copper, tin and lead from various parts of the world. And, since the early hunter gatherers didn't have any means of making metal themselves, it seems likely that they were getting it from nature.  However, most archaeologists agree that we are living in a material culture and that tools were the first means by which we began to create things. So it stands to reason that if they were creating so many things then they might have been looking for resources that were harder to come by. They would have looked to nature and found it.  In other words, it was the process of making tools that led to the discovery of metals, not the other way around. But, how we got here and how we got there is just one more of the many unanswered questions about our ancestors. Our research may have discovered another piece of the jigsaw puzzle.  It is believed that, as we started to use tools.

C2,"Given this story: Enough Sleep? Tiredness it is often claimed has become the modern condition. As the richer busier countries have grown so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings. Trying to sleep at night without the aid of some form of stimulant such as a glass of wine or a sleeping tablet is no more realistic than trying to climb Everest without oxygen supplies, according to the head of a leading sleep and memory research laboratory. Dr Robert Marshall, director of the Laboratory of Neural Plasticity and Sleep at the University of Pennsylvania, believes too many people are using over-the-counter sleeping tablets to combat sleeplessness. ""I do think some insomnia treatment is very over-the-counter,"" Dr Marshall said. ""Over-the-counter medication is not a substitute for seeing your physician."" There is no ""magic pill"" for sleeplessness, the head of one of the UK's foremost sleep laboratories has said. Dr Robert Marshall is director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania in the USA.

""It is likely the key to understanding insomnia is understanding how a person relates to his sleep, as opposed to the fact that a certain pill will make you fall asleep or stay asleep."" Dr Marshall said sleep problems were not caused by one factor such as stress or depression. He added: ""People who have insomnia are different from other people, which is why.

Dr Robert Marshall, director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, told the BBC: “There is no magic pill that will treat insomnia.
“There are many factors associated with a person’s vulnerability to insomnia. It is likely the key to understanding insomnia is understanding how a person relates to his sleep, as opposed to the fact that a certain pill will make you fall asleep or stay asleep.
“People with insomnia are different from other people, which is why.
“For those individuals, the most important issue may be their mood when going to bed, or their thoughts or emotions while going to bed.
“Another issue might be a specific environment, such as the bed itself. This issue could be related to something such as personal hygiene or the amount of light in the room.
“An even more important issue is, perhaps, anxiety about sleeping. If a person is anxious about having trouble sleeping, this could trigger an unpleasant anticipation of sleep and an effort to sleep earlier.
“If the sleep is uneventful, or even pleasant, this does not cause insomnia in itself. However, such uneventful sleep is likely to be more stressful for the individual and will lead to sleep disturbances.

To deal with this summer’s unusually high temperatures the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so in fact that at quiet times the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. Cannons Gym in the City of London has a reputation as a favoured lunchtime haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer’s unusually high temperatures it has gone overboard with air-conditioning. So much so that at quiet times the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. It’s this climate that has led to the gym’s staff being told to put the air conditioning down by their employer. When he started at the gym last year, Steve Sowter had no problem with it being opened at 10am on a Monday morning as usual. The office staff are used to being in the heat in the City of London. That all changed in November, however, when the air-conditioning was turned on early during a warm week. “One of the office guys came in at 9am and said ‘we’re getting fed up of it being on’ and he pointed towards the television and said that the temperature looked high,” said Sowter. In a conversation with the gym’s director Tim Wilson he was told that “we can only turn the a/c down to 17 degrees (Celsius), we can’t take it down any further”. “It is a large building with a lot of windows. If you’re not in it the temperature is warm,” Wilson told the Telegraph. This has led to some staff.

It is this kind of decision which is now being made by a growing number of companies, according to a survey. A survey conducted by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) found that 70% of companies in its survey would consider a fitness centre that refused to cool their staff on the grounds that it was too hot. Of those companies, 50% said that they would consider doing away with their contract with the fitness centre altogether. The survey also found that almost one in five staff expected their companies to reduce the number of breaks they take during the hot summer months and almost a third thought that the work of their fitness centre had dropped over the last year. It is a culture which is now developing among other businesses in the City of London. “Last year I was in there about 9pm, I went in to get my son some ice and noticed all the staff were standing and nobody was in the gym,” said Paul Wilson, director of Cannons Gym, a popular lunchtime haunt for workers in the Square Mile.

The lions seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal. But in a new study researchers at the University of British Columbia have found that the real dynamics of hunting by lions can be completely different from these depictions in Hollywood movies. ""The way the movies depict lion hunts is generally wrong,"" said study researcher Ian Wilson from UBC. ""We show that there is no such thing as a 'gaggle,' that's a common myth,"" Wilson said in a university news release. ""And the male lions that 'gaggle' - like Tom Cruise in The Lion King - are actually rare, solitary cats."" The researchers studied a video of a lion hunt from 2009 filmed in Kavango Desert, Botswana. They examined more than 8,000 seconds of footage recorded at the time and tracked every motion of every individual lion in that footage for six weeks. They found that each lion was a solitary hunter, as opposed to the stereotypical gang of lionesses. While some lions do work together as ""gaggles"" to hunt, those gaggles are made up of as many as 20 individual lions. The research could open up new opportunities for scientists studying the real behaviors of these predators. ""We might not know something as vital as what the true dynamics of the lion's hunt are,"" Wilson added.

C2,"Given this story: Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. Dennis Tito says he wants to take a couple to Mars. Tito’s announcement is part of his plans to build a spaceship to take four people to Mars in 2022, according to the New York Post. He has already raised $100 million of the $150 million needed for the trip. Tito is not giving up on that timeline, despite delays, and says he has another $50 million he’s willing to spend if necessary. Tito, 66, and his wife, Kristine, have made a fortune in oil, and he has a net worth of $600 million, according to Forbes. He recently sold his stake in the oil company Equatorial Guinea. According to the Post, he also plans to send people to the moon and establish colonies on both planets within the next 10 years. Tito, of course, is not alone in his space ambitions. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has proposed plans to send astronauts to the Moon using its Dragon craft, as well as to Mars. It has raised $1.5 billion for its next venture, Starman, a mission to send a man to orbit the Sun in 2025, and possibly to Mars in the 2030s. The billionaire mogul has also pledged to make Mars an habitable planet by the second half of this century. While Tito’s round-trip to Mars would be an incredible feat, a little over a century has passed since a human had the opportunity to go.

 The applicants must be physically and emotionally robust and must be able to withstand spaceflight.  

The job requirements include being middle-aged and married, possessing a bachelor’s degree in any field, and being able to speak and understand English.  

Applicants also must be able to sign a four-year “guaranteed commitment” to work full time for the mission.  

According to the agency, space-travel has a high likelihood of causing damage to the human body.  

The couple will have an opportunity to earn $40,000 per week for the entire mission.  

The couple who are selected will be provided with food, water, transportation, a sleeping area and entertainment.  

The selection process for the candidates will occur via a computer algorithm that will take into account their physical and emotional abilities, their ability to read and write in English, and how close their answers are to the stated goals of the mission.  
 
 The agency plans to launch a spaceship in 2022 that will land on Mars, leaving the astronauts for the first part of the journey, which"

The idea behind it is obvious: garbage gets piled up; the trucks drive past and pick it up again. How does that work?  One of the early experiments involved a system that the Guardian calls “recycling”. People in the London area were allowed to buy “compostable” bags that contained household waste. The bags themselves could be recycled, but they weren’t supposed to be. To be honest, I don’t really see the point. In theory, most people don’t buy “compostable” bags; that would mean more rubbish on the street, and that would be seen as bad. People don’t buy “compostable” plastic food containers; that would mean more rubbish on the streets. The government should have been thinking about this; instead, it gave us an extra tax on single-use plastics, with the result that everything now has a huge price tag.  So now.

C2,"Given this story: 0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. I am not alone in having my doubts about the oral history profession. For example, the American Historical Association has called for an end to oral history collections at the Archives of American Art; the American Ethnographic Society has warned of the dangers of conflating “historians and ethnographers”; and there are concerns that the new generation of historians will not be interested in oral history, particularly as a source of evidence because, as they put it: “Historians, by virtue of their specialty, are in a distinct position from other members of the community who are more interested in personal histories.”      But I think they are missing something. Oral history has the potential to provide a valuable, if sometimes less polished, record of historical narratives as they were being shared in the past. Not that they are perfect records. As is obvious in listening to interviews conducted in different contexts, they have many shortcomings.      I think there is a distinction to be made between what I call the “form” of oral history, which consists of the historical accounts themselves as they are being shared in context, and the “content” of oral history, which consists of accounts that have been interpreted to provide a record of how people experienced past events. I am referring here to what are known as “interpretive accounts” or “interpreter” accounts. These are the most commonly found among oral history collections and.

Output the generated story directly. When the people interviewed for the Oral History Project of the Federal Bureau of Investigation came to a bank robbery in San Francisco in the early 1900s, they were asked by the bank clerk what they did there. One of them replied, “We saw a play.” But they did not describe the play. Did they not want to make the robbery look like they were ordinary people and not professional criminals? This was an important event in the development of public opinion regarding organized crime, but it is not an important event in the history of the San Francisco stage.       But to me the most interesting part of the oral history was when the interviewer asked if they had heard of the play before. The person described it as a “tragic play” in which the characters were all fools. “Well,” he said, “there was some truth in the statement.”       Oral histories are rich sources of materials on human behavior. We will probably never reach the point in which people will record information in the same form as people did in the past. But I am sure that we can improve the quality of the information that we can find, by listening carefully, and by applying the best tools available to us. It is always difficult to determine what is an important event in the history of an event. I suspect that there are many more incidents that can be described as such and are not often mentioned in historical accounts."

A company in the United Kingdom is now selling boda bikes that cost £1,495, which seems cheap but is actually a lot of money for a bike that costs £500. Boda bikes are made of bamboo and are lightweight, so they won't break your wallet. But the company, based in Devon, also sells a bamboo bike that costs less than $1,500. The company won the 2014 Red Dot Design award, which is an international design competition that recognizes the best product designs in the world. The company currently sells only three of its bamboo bikes in the United Kingdom and three in the Netherlands, but it's hoping to expand its clientele.      Bamboo is an extremely durable plant that can be found throughout Asia and has a long and storied history of being used to build all kinds of things — from houses to furniture. Bamboo bikes are designed to be easy to repair or replace parts on; the frames are typically made of a light, durable bamboo. But the most famous bamboo bike is the Bamboo Cycle, a project that has been around since 2003 and has been featured in countless magazines. The Bamboo Cycle is a very different kind of bike from the Boda Bike, which is built of bamboo.

C2,"Given this story: Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. The vervet monkey, a close relative of the monkeys known as orangutans, was not supposed to live in Madagascar. As far back as the mid-1900s, zoologists considered it extinct. A new analysis of more than a century of data collected on the vervet monkeys, though, suggests that the animals still exist, although in much smaller numbers. A study published Thursday in the journal Science uses that data to determine that about 1,000 vervet monkeys are living in Madagascar today. A smaller, but still significant, number of the animals live in northern Madagascar, which was once colonised by Europeans. “In my whole life,” said the lead author, Susan Cheney, a behavioral ecologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, “I’ve never seen a monkey study before.” The finding challenges longstanding assumptions that the vervet monkey is endemic to Madagascar, a place best known for a spectacular collection of unique and colorful creatures such as its unique species of orangutan, the Malagasy pangolin and the world’s only living antelope, the vulture lemur. While the number of animals is still not enough to support a viable, free-roaming population, researchers say the fact that the vervet monkeys are still living in the wild represents a scientific breakthrough. The animals have long been the subject of debate and speculation about their future. They were first.

Madagascar: The vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe, in their 2008 book “Madagascar: An Animal Story” and their 2013 BBC documentary “Madagascar: Where Are They Now?,” are not actually extinct. Rather, they were thought to be entirely extinct by the mid-1900s, when a team of international scientists was compiling a detailed description of an endangered lemur. They concluded that Madagascar’s last vervet monkeys lived in the northeast of the island and wrote their findings down in a 1906 study. It is, however, the new analysis of a century’s worth of vervet monkey sightings in Madagascar that suggests those animals still live there, Cheney and her colleagues report in Science.

The vervet monkeys, a close relative of the monkeys known as orangutans, are small, agile, arboreal monkeys that live in the rainforests of the tropical forests of Madagascar. They are among the smallest of the many primates that inhabit the island. While they are no longer the endangered species they were, the vervet monkeys remain the most endangered primate on Madagascar. Cheney, an expert in the animals’ behavioral ecology, and her colleagues suspected that the vervet monkeys have continued to live in their natural range, north of the capital city of Antananarivo.

To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face gets in your sandwiches and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. I often find myself on the beach trying to retrieve something lost during the previous day. Usually it is some trinket which I just lost track of and have now buried in the sand. When I try to get it out it is always a struggle, especially if it is something like a straw hat which I don't fancy tramping through knee-deep sand after it has been sitting in my bag on the beach for six hours. What I do find helpful is this nifty tool from the early 1800's, which not only is very simple to use but it also helps to keep my lost item in the sand. A lot of other things have been invented since the invention of the sand-holder but none has such a simple but very efficient function.  This sand-holder looks rather like a miniature windmill, although this isn't exactly how it works. Instead, this holder works by having a number of wheels at the bottom of the holder, which turn when the sand holder is tilted. The sand that is sucked into the holder is then deposited on the beach while the holder is turned. You can imagine that this is a very simple contraption which works by a principle quite similar to the one found in the 'golf ball' vacuums that are common in high end cleaning kits. This means that as long as there is enough sand available to turn the wheel the sand-holder will work quite efficiently. Sand-holders have become so common in the.

The sand-holder looks rather like a miniature windmill. Although this isn't exactly how it works, this isn't exactly how it works. Instead, this holder works by having a number of wheels at the bottom of the holder, which turn when the sand holder is tilted. The sand that is sucked into the holder is then deposited on the beach while the holder is turned. You can imagine that this is a very simple device which works by a principle quite similar to the one found in the 'golf ball' vacuums that are common in high end cleaning kits. This means that as long as there is enough sand available to turn the wheel the sand holder will work quite efficiently. Sand-holders have become so common in the recent years.

C2,"Given this story: Art on TV Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details. My answer: There are a host of reasons why artists rarely get their work on TV, the most important, of course, is that, generally speaking, television is not a good vehicle for visual information. It is a visual medium, but it is not a sensory one: most people see with their eyes, and that information is often transmitted to the brain through the eye movements we do when watching television. A good example of this is advertising on television; in most cases the creative direction for the visual is dictated by marketing goals, which means the images presented onscreen are designed to be highly ""sellable"". Most television shows, including art programming, are produced without this sort of audience-centred consideration, and end up looking like adverts designed to maximize impact. The result is that most television art programmes look like commercial advertisements: a sequence of close-ups, a montage, with one or two actual works of art shown in the middle of the sequence. The reason that most television art shows look the way they do is that they have to. There is little reason to create something that looks good if it is simply going to be viewed for an hour every week. One thing I would like to see is television shows about the visual arts, which would allow artists to use the medium to do their work as they like. I would like to see artists taking the opportunity to tell us about their works, their inspirations, their ideas and how they work:.

C2,"Given this story: The Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. This is not the first time Tom Hanks has been lampooned by the Hollywood press. Last week, Hanks appeared in an ABC News segment about his charity work in the Philippines. As the story went, the Captain was about to hand over his first $10,000 to a local orphanage. In the video below Hanks can be heard exclaiming, “Wow! Can you believe it? They gave me a camera!” This video clip immediately went viral, and even earned a nod from Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention last week. It seems like Hanks has long cultivated the image of a middling actor. To many of his fans, there is an element of snobbery and arrogance in his refusal to talk about what an Oscar-winner he is. In a 2002 interview with the New York Times, Hanks explained his “aversion to the artistry” and “inclination to avoid public displays of admiration” for his achievements. He goes on to discuss “the inherent discomfort” of discussing his craft as an actor: Actors are in that arena all the time. Every day is a day you try to be an actor. So many people are there, you know, trying to get on, trying to act, trying to get somewhere, trying to do anything, you know, that I would find it odd that it was one day. But it isn’t. The.

Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth they will soon be exchanging words. I don't like people who can count. It's one thing to figure out that a person can add up to six in his head, but what is all that other stuff about, anyway? Why is he so sure that the sixth number he adds up is going to add up to seven? Maybe seven is the only number in which he can get it right, or maybe seven is the only number in which he can add up to at all. I really don't care. It's only six in his head, anyway. So let's all get back to the business of counting because our species has come to rely on it - not only to help people keep track of things, but to understand how to use things. There is absolutely no way to know, for instance, what kind of life you or I would lead without language, and in turn there is nothing more interesting or rewarding in our life than knowing that a living thing in another part of the world knows something we don't. But language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine our life without it, nor is there anything in our life more interesting or rewarding than knowing that a living thing in another part of the world has been able to use language to express herself or himself.      So we must keep at it - learn to count, so we can get the full benefit of our ability to communicate. It's not just about the numbers anymore - it's about the connections between them.

A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the 20th century. The show, called Kinetic Art Rejoice, is curated by the French art historian Sophie Verdière, who has also done books on artists such as Alber Elbaz. She has written that the “development of kinetic art can be traced from the very beginnings of postwar modernism in the United States to Japan and the UK, where it quickly found its home, thanks to a new generation of international artists and scientists”. It sounds complicated — and it is, though not necessarily because of all the moving parts. Verdière has put together an exhibition of 50 objects, mostly found in private and institutional collections. They range from the relatively simple — a bicycle wheel — to the highly abstract — a pair of electric motors spinning an intricate propeller. In between are paintings, photographs and videos.

C2,"Given this story: CRYING Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness. Crying is an innate human behaviour. Evolutionists say our primary motivation for crying is to help other people to empathise with our feelings and to feel less helpless. But it turns out crying is so much more than that: our very instincts for crying may have evolved to help us cope with life's stresses and come out on the other side stronger and wiser. This week's study published in Nature journal found that mothers of human children produce many more tears than they did 20 years ago. Researchers from the University of British Columbia followed mothers and their children for up to 35 years. Their findings show that for mothers there are two significant periods during a child's early life: one of ""tenderness"", where crying is likely to be emotional rather than physical, and one of ""mature emotional response"" where it may be less easy for mothers to control their emotions. The researchers say that tears are produced in response to a number of different things. First, the mother's fear of abandonment might come through the release of tears. Or she may feel vulnerable as her child is growing up and feel the need to cry to get her strength back. According to evolutionary theorist Steven Pinker, the ""visceral"" emotional response of crying, the part of our brain that responds physically to the experience of pain, is something that's been ingrained in us since we first emerged from the ocean. When the first primate evolved from an amphibian, its ancestors developed a nervous system that allowed them.

C2,"Given this story: Food There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting. Last week, I saw two films. The first was called The Death of Stalin. It was good in parts but could have been a lot better. The second was called A Very English Scandal. I had wanted to see this but sadly it is not shown at our local cinema. So I thought I would watch it on BBC iPlayer.      To be honest I found A Very English Scandal rather boring. While it is true that it is very revealing of political hypocrisy and the impact it has on people’s lives, I can’t imagine it is much fun to live through. Yet in watching it I found myself nodding my head in recognition and agreeing with much that was said – particularly how the cover-up affected the man and the woman it involved. That is a great achievement in itself, I suppose.      I have no interest in the Royal Family so I don’t have a preference as to the monarchy but the Queen does have an impressive stamina and ability to put one thing behind her and focus on the next. Given how many things she is currently involved in, I think many people would struggle to cope and her ability to move on is quite extraordinary.

I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish, it is hardly worth attempting. Last week, I saw two films. The first was called The Death of Stalin. It was good in parts but could have been a lot better. The second was called A Very English Scandal. I had wanted to see this but sadly it is not shown at our local cinema. So I thought I would watch it on BBC iPlayer.      To be honest I found A Very English Scandal rather boring. While it is true that it is very revealing of political hypocrisy and the impact it has on people’s lives, I can’t imagine it is much fun to live through. Yet in watching it I found myself nodding my head in recognition and agreeing with much that was said – particularly how the cover-up affected the man and the woman it involved. That is a great achievement in itself, I suppose.      I have no interest in the Royal Family so I don’t have a preference as to the monarchy, but the Queen does have an impressive stamina and ability to put one thing behind her and focus on the next. Given how many things she is currently involved in, I think many people would"

Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class. The dining room was in good repair, with several small tables and chairs and a handsome old grand piano.  In his study was a large chest of drawers, and in a corner, opposite the window, was a bookshelf stocked with various volumes – many of them volumes. He had inherited a library from an old friend and a man whom he had greatly admired – a man who had been both a close friend and an adviser in the business affairs and social life of this house. Sir Henry and Lady Manners were extremely generous with their time in an endeavour to encourage the younger generation – an undertaking in which their son played a particularly important part. In fact, they had taken great pains to ensure that their son was well educated and cultured. It was the parents’ wish that their son was a man of refinement and sophistication, and that he should become a gentleman of the first order.

C2,"Given this story: Advertising on trial If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. The Advertising Association is seeking to prove that adverts can be of some value and they should be allowed to appear in TV programmes, the High Court heard on Monday. The association, whose members include accountants Deloitte, is one of three groups opposing the regulator's application to ban adverts from ITV's Sunday prime time programme, Good Morning Britain. The advertisers are also opposing the application. The Advertising Standards Authority is applying for an injunction prohibiting adverts from the programme as it considers whether to launch a ban on adverts on ITV. The application came after one of the presenters complained on air to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid that an ad for an alcoholic beverage was not suitable for young people because it was shown while a school playground was empty. ""This is why advertising is so harmful to children"", complained Morgan. Reid, Morgan and ITV management were among those at the High Court hearing. A court has been told that the regulator has concluded that adverts which appear on Good Morning Britain in the 10.30am to noon hour before it was moved from ITV daytime slot to 10pm at night can be seen by viewers. However the regulator, which is also being challenged by the PCC watchdog and the British Beer and Pub Association, also accepts the adverts have sometimes been shown in the morning without it being known to ITV management. In its ruling on why it was seeking to ban adverts the regulator said: ""The panel found that ad.

ITV is seeking an injunction and a declaration that the ASA's proposed code of practice should not apply to the programme, and the advertising rulebook should apply. The broadcaster's legal team said a ban would give it an unfair advantage over the opposition parties. In a separate action the PCC wants the rulebook to apply and has asked the court to give an indication that it is likely to succeed. The PCC said it was concerned that viewers would see adverts despite the ASA ban. It said it had been concerned about the issue before the issue came up on Good Morning Britain. ""The ASA can only act by way of a prohibition order, which means ITV has a significant advantage over the PCC, which has a lesser capability to act,"" said Jonathan Gee, the PCC's director of regulation. However Mr Leach said the rulebook should apply to adverts. ""The rulebook says you have an equal right to say what you want to say on air,"" Mr Leach told the court. But the British Beer and Pub Association told the court it objected to the ASA seeking to ban adverts and that the code was unnecessary. Judge Andrew McFarlane said there appeared to be a clear difference between adverts and non-adverts. ""I must be very cautious before giving way to the view that these are two different"
C2,"Given this story: How to Write Poetry Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. One of the hardest things to do with poetry is to describe the experience of writing it.  It's easy to give advice about that, but how do we know if we're giving the right advice?  If it's easy, then why does it give people such difficulty?  In fact, people tend to write poetry with an unusual lack of success in mind:  ""How do I get published?""  ""How do I sell my book?""  ""When will my book get published?""  Those are all great questions but not the ones you're likely to encounter on your path to writing poetry.  It's more like:  ""How do I write something that makes me feel good?"" One way to help is to give advice that has already been expressed, by someone.  In that way, you're telling someone how to do something they already know how to do and you're not actually giving the advice.  It's hard to beat that.  So here we go. ""How to Write Poetry"" will go out the door with the answer.  It will not say ""Go write some poetry,"" but ""Go write some poetry.""  Now what we have is two choices.  The easy one is to go and write some poetry but it might be a good idea to give a little thought to the question we just asked.  What do we have to lose?  Let's begin with that. How to Write Poetry is not really advice.

We all have ideas about what good poetry should be.  How to Write Poetry says go do it.  It also says that poetry is often un-publishable.  That's the point; it's to get you thinking about what poetry you are writing, and then how.  And once you start to think about poetry that way, you might try writing more poetry and then you may look into that.  Or you might decide to write some non-poetry work, then look into poetry.  In the end, I think writing poetry is just like writing any other kind of writing.  Just start.  It's the hard part.  It's easy to give advice about how to do that, but if you're too specific, you're not really giving advice, and if you're too vague, the advice isn't likely to work.

C2,"Given this story: The two sisters kept Lily’s driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement) before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone. At one time or another, Lily and Rose had done every trip along the old railway line. The sisters were so fond of the old train that when a road and tramway was built through the old railway cutting at the side of the allotments (there were old railway lines and tramways all around the garden) the sisters stopped driving as soon as the tramway was opened. They took their little red car to the junction with the old railway track and took the carriages, which had been replaced after a fire, to the top of the over-bridge and dropped them down into the new carriages at the bottom of the bridge. It was a good thing that Lily was not driving with them. She would have felt very responsible for anything she left at the top of the over-bridge. One morning Lily was driving and Rose was in the back seat when they passed the railway cutting (the one without a tramway) to go to their favourite spot at the allotments to look at the blue jays and chickadees nesting on the old railway line. There was a bench at the top of the cutting and Lily was able to see the railway cutting quite clearly from the bench. But, that morning Rose was not driving. They could not hear her when she called for her dog, Fergus, at the bottom of the cutting. Lily could hear the dog barking from the back seat, but not the response.  This was not the first time that Lily had been without.

The members of the group, having eaten, return to the nest and the cuckoos go back to the singing. It's been a fascinating book.

Even a member of that mythical species the completely tone deaf could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Joanna’s Lessons is a series of books aimed specifically at children who wish to learn how to play the piano and who have already been taught by a teacher. The stories are fun and engaging, written for both children who have never sat down at the piano before and children who may have been taught by their parents or other family members. In the first book, the four-year old, Tommy, has spent three years living with his Aunt and Uncle who both taught him how to write his name. However, they never showed him how to play the piano. That all changes when Uncle Phil is forced to return to the hospital and Tommy and Auntie Phylis are faced with the daunting task of looking after the house on their own. With help from his family’s neighbors, including a lovable and chatty cat, Tommy learns how to read music, how to arrange the piano keys in different keys and how to play simple melodies. But with the help of his new found friends, Tommy learns to see the piano as a magical instrument and to see his practice sessions as enjoyable family time. The result is not only a successful first book in a series but also a book with real appeal to children learning the piano, and adults who care about the wellbeing of children. The second book in the series, the ten-year old, Lucy, loves to read and as she moves into the house next door she finds herself reading to her new friend, Muffy. Lucy is excited.

This can be very frustrating for the writer but also illuminating. Working on a script I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point. As anyone who has used Wikipedia will tell you, there is a significant issue with editing: sometimes the text changes with the addition of a new sentence. That's why, to the extent I have edited, I have usually only changed a few words. And if I really want to alter a piece of text, I'll use the spell-checker. But the editing process can reveal a great deal about the text and the author's intention. Sometimes, this is positive: as a screenwriter, I often re-work dialogue or the narration of a scene to better suit the voice of the character or script. Sometimes it's negative, as with ""every picture tells a story"", which is the title of the story that I am adapting. In my original novel, it was used in the middle of the second section, after a description of the setting and some background. I cut it out in my screenplay, and in doing so, revealed to myself that the author meant the entire book. Even if it did not work in the book, it was still useful in describing how the story would look on the page. That, however, did not make it a good choice to use in the final cut of the film. If I had re-used the sentence, I would have lost some of the detail in the film version. But I would have retained the overall meaning, which is important when working to cut the film into a specific format. For the same reason, I.

Output the generated story directly. Every Picture Tells a Story is a story about a couple of people. Each character is independent in the story. For this reason, I want to start by making a few observations about their relationship.  The story follows a relationship that goes as follows: 

Marianne was in love with a young engineer named Robert, but because of a lack of finances, they were forced to postpone the marriage.

Robert was in love with Marianne.

Marianne was forced to live at her parents home because they were trying to find a job for her. 

Robert was on his way to work, when he spotted his beloved Marianne sitting in a car.

As you can see, they are in each other's lives in many different ways. 

The story centers around this relationship.  It would make no sense for the story to be the other way around.  When I started to work on the film, I decided that I wanted them to be in love with each other, but I didn't want to show this explicitly, because I didn't want to make the story about a couple falling in love.  By avoiding this obvious trope, the story is able to deal with such important issues such as money, family dynamics, and romantic love.

I took that example and added some other details, such as the character Robert, and in the following story:

C2,"Given this story: The Heat is On We’ve all heard of global warming but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives? Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. The effects of global warming will become apparent very soon. We know this because of global warming. The temperature of the earth's atmosphere has increased because of it. There will be more droughts, and this may become a serious problem. There will also be more floods, so that areas that were previously flooded will no longer be. If this happens, then the costs of insurance for houses built on land that was previously flooded may go up. There are also likely to be more storms, which may also result in more damage to property. If this happens, then costs for insurance could also increase. Global warming may also cause more of the world's fresh water to become saltwater, so that people may need to find new water supplies. The effects of rising sea levels are already starting to be apparent in some places. One example is that sea levels in India are rising at an alarming rate. The amount of rain that falls in India has decreased over the last few years. Because of this, many areas in India are becoming drier and are suffering from the lack of rain. There will not always be sufficient water for everyone on earth. This will lead to a great deal of conflict because food may not be able to be produced as well as it is now. Other aspects of global warming, such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, will also affect people on different parts of the planet. If ice sheets melt rapidly, for example, then rivers and oceans will drain away as the.

C2,"Given this story: Maps The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth’s surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. A map is a graphical representation of geographic information about the Earth's surface. Map illustrations are created through the study and practice of cartography, which combines mapmaking techniques from geography with the visual arts, especially painting. The earliest known map of the world was drawn by Phoenician astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century BC. Mapmaking was practiced around the world before the development of printing in the 14th century. Maps are used for navigation, identification and plotting various purposes. Maps can help people to find points and points of interest (e.g., places of interest such as lakes, mountains, and volcanoes, people, and wildlife). For example, maps can identify roads or trails, the most efficient ways to travel between various points. A map can also show a route to a place. A map can help people understand a place. Some maps are illustrated to communicate information about the place, its features, and the people who live in it. Other maps are used for propaganda, and are intended to mislead, inform, or convey information. Historical maps are also commonly used as teaching tools.  To create a map, a mapmaker uses a number of different map making tools. A cartographer may use a compass to draw a meridian or a protractor to draw a line. A mapmaker may also use a stiletto to trace the land features on the ground. In the Middle Ages, the use of parchment was still common to create maps. A st.

C2,"Given this story: HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. In 1882, the man was widely admired. In his first recorded expedition, with his first vessel, the SS Adrestia, he was at the vanguard of what would become the first major Antarctic exploration. His boldness, vision and determination helped to establish the Antarctic territory as an enduring home of scientific research. The Antarctic Treaty of 1961 put an end to war in the continent. But he will always be remembered as the man who became stranded. On 8 January 1912, Shackleton, his crew and his ship Endurance were forced to attempt the return from Antarctica of the team who had started the crossing. With Shackleton’s men having abandoned ship on their way back, with his boat stuck in a snowfield and with no hope of rescue, the captain had no choice but to abandon the ship, set out for land, and begin his return to England, using his team as a mobile tent for the journey. For the remainder of the voyage, Endurance was an iceberg. Shackleton’s story and the subsequent disaster was the subject of the book and film The Polar Bear, written by the explorer James Le Mesurier, who died in 2008. This week, the Antarctic Heritage Alliance (AHA), a UK-based organisation dedicated to the conservation of Antarctica, is celebrating what would have been the centenary of Shackleton’s second Antarctic expedition. The AHA will be putting on public exhibitions about Shackleton in Southampton and London, and it will.

C2,"Given this story: Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain. In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. What has happened to our music culture and to the music playing skills of music lovers? To a great extent it has been the consequence of two technological developments.  The first is the music industry’s complete change of focus from recorded music to the digital age. The second is the increasing impact of technology on music, on the ways that music is listened to, and on the kinds of music which can be played. In the last 20 years a major change has occurred in our ability to listen to music on a daily basis. That change has taken place because of two technological developments, both of which were, and still are, associated with the digital age. The first is the development and rapid commercial success of portable wireless devices. The second is that these have led to the development of portable music players which are capable of storing huge amounts of music for personal listening, of playing that music without a CD, or of being able to make portable music available on a wireless network using MP3 or other digital formats. The increase in our capacity to store music on portable music devices led, of course, to the development of an entirely new way of consuming music. This is now a daily occurrence. We are listening to music on a portable device, rather than a fixed device in the kitchen or in the living room, and while we are doing that we are switching between two or more digital formats. It is a daily habit now to turn on our MP3 player at breakfast and.

Now, a few decades on, she has decided to set aside a good chunk of that window every day for a different purpose. She is the first director of a music archive at Leeds Music Library and in her new role she is determined to archive the sounds of Leeds as they were recorded in the past.
Susan is looking at recording as many of the songs that were sung by Leeds music-makers in the late 19th and early 20th century as she can. “One of my goals is to understand how they lived,” she says. The archive is going to be a resource to all interested people but one which will be particularly helpful to musicians. “There will be thousands of songs,” Susan explains. “A lot of them will have been recorded by local bands that made it big. They might be recordings they were happy with or the records record companies were happy with but probably not the ones they preferred. These records will all be in the archive.”
While her job as archive director will take her around the city in search of songs, she is also going to be researching the history of the music being made by local performers in Leeds. Her goal is to create a resource for musicians of the future in which there will be not just the recordings"

C2,"Given this story: Photography When a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills personal views and experience together with a set of social and cultural norms. Photography is a visual art in which human action is interpreted as a series of light or color signals, or images. These signals are either captured directly by a camera or converted to electric signals by another method. A photograph may take an image as light or as a color signal on an image plane, or may create an illusion by placing an object on a surface.  The history of photography dates back to the development of printing and photography has been considered an art since 1730. Photographers use multiple techniques to reproduce photographic images. The development of photography has enabled images to be produced that were once only possible in the darkroom by a process known as printing. The printing process allowed images to be reproduced quickly. These developments changed the nature of photography from a technical art to an art form.  Photography has been referred to as an art form, not just because it is a form of visual communication, but because it is ""about form"". The photographer as an artist uses specific criteria to form and interpret images. These criteria and images are then communicated via a physical medium (a photograph) to the viewers, which creates a new and separate meaning. When an image is not considered an artwork, it loses the value associated with the artist. Photographers use a diverse range of different techniques and materials to create their photographs.  The types of photography include portrait, portrait composition, street, landscape, wildlife, travel, commercial, fashion, macro and astrophotography.  Portrait.

Output the generated story directly. It is dark. The light bulb inside the dark room flicks on.  Suddenly, a photographer stands next to the light bulb, points at it and takes a picture.  He or she selects a specific part of the light bulb for the shot. The photographer then takes the same shot from different angle to create a composite image. It is a very complex sequence of operations and the photographer has to apply special techniques to be able to accomplish this series of operations. In this case, the photographer selects part of the light bulb. This process of selecting the area to be exposed to the light from a specific point is called selecting the focus point. He or she then takes a wide angle shot using the fisheye lens to get a wide range of view. After the picture is taken the photographer moves the selected part of the light bulb to another position to get a more precise focus. If the photographer wants a better picture he or she takes the same shot from another angle and uses a second exposure with the second camera. He or she then combines the two photos using photo editor software. The camera was equipped with several features that help the photographer to take the exact photograph. These features are very cleverly put into the camera. The camera was designed to help the photographer to select the correct part of the object to capture, adjust the focus and focus to a different part of the object and capture the picture.

It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. When people today say that ""I think the Internet is going to change the world"" I sometimes take it a step further and ask if they mean not just the ""broadcasting"" aspect of it but also the way that they think of technology. The question that I pose then is not a rhetorical one (or it shouldn't be at least) because, as the last paragraph of this piece indicates, I believe we are already at the moment when technology is broadcasting in such a way that society will have to think about its own future.  One example of this kind of broadcasting is something like the Internet, something that seems to be growing and spreading without control. The Internet, in the old sense of the term (broadcasting over an airwave), may have come to be because of the way that people used it, and now that people have come to use it in this way it is also spreading. But how does it work? As the first paragraph of this piece indicates I believe it is because people are thinking in terms of how to make the most of this thing as opposed to simply using this thing to get what they want.  The second paragraph describes how one person's idea of using technology might be another's idea of controlling technology. What we have right now, with a rapidly growing technology (the Internet) is that society is in fact being changed. Not by this Internet per se, but because of that same Internet. Now we have a way for us to transmit ideas in.

Technology is broadcasting itself around the world, so that it can be controlled. It is being controlled by the fact that the people who use it now have come up with different ways to use it. One of these ways is to make the most of it for the benefits it has to offer and another is to use it to control it. The Internet is being used in different ways and society is being changed. Not by the Internet per se, but because of the Internet. Now we have a way for us to transmit ideas.

C2,"Given this story: Writing Reviews Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner’s point of view. Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. Writing Reviews Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner’s point of view. Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life.      If you read a review and wonder why it appears to be written by a person who has never read the book it reviews you can be sure that the writer has not read the book being reviewed. In fact, if a reviewer has not read the book being reviewed it will probably be because they do not want to have to read it.     Reviewers who review books that they do not want to read are going to be more interested in a review which gives their book a bad review than a review which gives their book a good review. Most reviewers don’t like to review books that they think will be unpopular. In fact, they don’t like to review books that they expect are popular. The risk for a reviewer is that if they are writing a good review they won’t get any response from it, whereas a bad review gets a very enthusiastic response. A good reviewer also has to make sure that their review does not seem too self-serving. In other words, they need to make sure that they don’t get too much in return for doing their job. If the reviewer gets a lot of praise, that could be seen as self-aggrandising. If they get a lot of criticism that could.

Output the generated story directly. The book review, which is the most public form of review, has been described as the most widely read news story of the year. However, it appears that many of the reviews that get the most attention do not read the books they review. For example, the New York Times gave away more than 100 copies of the book One Summer by John Updike, and the reviews were less than positive. When reviewing books for a magazine, a reviewer should have the desire to read the book being reviewed. Reviewers usually have an emotional investment in the book being reviewed because they either have been readers of the book themselves or because the reviewer has something against the book. This can lead to a biased or negative review.   The aim of this study was to examine whether the review process had an affect on how accurate a review was. By using an experimental design with nine reviewers, the accuracy of all the reviews was examined. Eight reviewers had read the book being reviewed while the ninth reviewer had never read the book. The results of the experiment showed that the ninth reviewer’s reviews were generally more positive than the reviews of the eight reviewers that had read the book. The results also showed that the accuracy of the reviews was highly dependent on the reviewers’ emotional investment in the book being reviewed. It would therefore be advisable for a review to be written by someone who has not read the book being reviewed, in order to obtain an unbiased review of the book.       "
C2,"Given this story: Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941 despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst its alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. ""We have been living in the shadow of that film,"" says Orson Welles. ""It has been an obsession with me to give it a full and complete performance."" For some Hollywood filmmakers a film is merely a set of scenes with some talking heads in an auditorium. For others, that film's the entire reason they became artists. Orson Welles came to movies with a passion for storytelling. ""From that point on I devoted myself to finding the structure, the rhythm, the form, the language, the mood, and the psychology of film,” Welles told the Los Angeles Times in a 1988 interview, which was used in the documentary Citizen Kane, in 1994. ""It was like learning a new language. I didn't know how I was going to find the sounds, the tones, the rhythms, the images, the moods, the atmospheres - I didn't know exactly how I was going to do it, but I knew I had to do it.""  In a 2012 interview with the BBC, Welles said that, after he saw the unfinished work of William Faulkner, he ""became obsessed"" with film and storytelling, ""and never quite got over it."" ""For me, the most exciting thing about film is to be able to see people who aren’t famous in front of an audience, the way the audience can see them in a movie,"" he told the BBC. ""That is what it's all.

Output the generated story directly. After the sudden death of his wife in 1938, William Randolph Hearst decides to give his money away to charity after years of trying to control the media by creating rival newspapers and magazines. The newspaper he wishes to control is the Sunday paper, the New York World, which his friend Frank Capra has bought. The newspaper editor, Orson Welles, is hired to write the script for the film. The first draft is considered very poor, and Welles attempts to rewrite it, but is told that Welles does not understand the business of writing. He decides to go to New York to work as an editorial writer for the Daily News instead. On his first day in New York, he reads a story about the death of William Randolph Hearst. Welles finds it strange that after Hearst's death, the New York World and the New York Daily News both report on the same news. He continues to read about Hearst and his family and decides to make a movie based on that story. The story he has comes from an unpublished manuscript by William Faulkner. The film is told from the perspective of the young Will Kane, who has ambitions to be a screenwriter and works as a copy boy for a newspaper. While he is there, he becomes interested in stories as well as the family of a millionaire, the Littles. Kane is forced to read about the death of one of them: his father. After Kane decides to leave the copy desk to follow the Litt"
C2,"Given this story: England’s breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. Bread and butter were a feature of English breakfasts until the mid-19th century, but a new study has claimed that the morning meal was almost unknown until the middle ages. By comparing medieval cookbooks, it has been found that most people were only eating simple cereals like barley or wheat or a basic meal of bread, cheese and sometimes eggs – although the French had already developed a taste for French toast centuries before then. The results point to the idea that the English first ate hearty dishes when they moved north from continental Europe at the end of the 13th century. The researchers believe the discovery highlights the role that the countryside played in the diet of people at that time. The French, who were much richer than the English at the time, took over the cuisine of the nation, largely due to the invention of the frying pan, while English cuisine underwent a “barnetisation” in which the more humble foods, such as barley or wheat, took over from expensive animal protein. However, one of the biggest changes to the typical English breakfast was the advent of the “English muffin” which was invented by Sir John Lanchester in 1713, and has now become so ingrained in the English diet it can even be argued that there is no such thing as an English breakfast without it. According to the results of the new research the earliest description of a traditional English breakfast, as defined by the researchers, is from a 13th.
