Lily loved nothing more than exploring the lush forests and rolling hills of her kingdom, and she spent every spare moment riding her favorite horse, Thunder. One day, while out on a ride, Lily stumbled upon a hidden path she had never seen before. She followed it, and soon found herself in a dense, dark forest.

Lily felt a shiver run down her spine, but she refused to turn back. She was determined to uncover the secrets that lay hidden in the heart of the forest. As she rode, the trees grew even taller and closer together, until they formed a thick, impenetrable canopy overhead. Lily could hear strange noises all around her - the rustling of leaves, the snapping of twigs, and the distant howling of wolves"

The kingdom of Eridoria was divided into four quadrants, each ruled by a powerful sorcerer, who answered only to the Council of Wizards in the capital city of Eldrador. Arin was the eldest son of King Maric, the ruler of the northern quadrant, and had been groomed since birth to inherit the throne. However, his life took an unexpected turn when his father was killed in a battle with a neighboring kingdom, and Arin was forced to flee for his life.
