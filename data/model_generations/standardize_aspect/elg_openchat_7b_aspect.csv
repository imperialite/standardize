A2,"Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings like museums to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers are the clever people who decide if the building is going to be strong enough and how it will be made.

Building a house

Building a house is the most important thing we do. Even before people could write, they built houses out of mud or wood. For centuries, people have built their houses out of stone. They used the stone as a wall to protect them from the cold winds. In more recent years, houses have been built out of concrete and brick. These are strong materials. People have also built houses out of wood. Wood is very beautiful and easy to work with. But wood is not as strong as concrete or brick. To make a house strong, the builder must use strong materials. But the house must be more than strong. It must be beautiful too. The builder must work carefully. The builder must make the house nice to live in. The builder must also make the house easy to keep clean. The builders must plan the house very carefully. They must decide where all the rooms are going to be. They must decide where the front door will be.

Building a school

Schools are very important buildings. They are where we learn and play. Before the nineteenth century, children mostly worked with their parents. School was different. Children went to a special place to learn, just like grown-ups. It was called a school. The school was a simple wooden building with a blackboard on the wall."
A2,"'No' said Harry. 'I won't go. I'm your best man and this town has problems.' 'Yes' said Paul 'you are my best man. But you must understand something. After we go the people here in Dante's Peak will stay. They have their shops and their businesses. You think only about volcanoes but this is about money too.' 'OK' Harry said with a smile. 'We'll do it. I'll do anything for you. I'll be your best man.'

Harry Dalton and Rachel Wando are a geologist and seismologist, married, with one son. Rachel works for the government, Harry freelances but the two are in constant contact and collaboration. When Rachel is assigned to study Dante's Peak, a mountain in Washington state, she flies out there alone. As she travels there, Harry takes the opportunity to go skiing with his son. When Rachel calls to announce they should be looking at a possible evacuation, Harry leaves his son with his friend, Paul Dixon, and rushes out to meet her.

He arrives in the small town to find Rachel and her team, including geologist Jeff, have discovered a crater in the ice at the top of the mountain. It is an active volcano. Rachel estimates that it could erupt in six to eight days. The town has an evacuation plan, but it is for a more distant eruption. Harry suggests they should evacuate the town, but their superiors don't listen and he is sent home.

In the days that follow, Harry continues to try and convince the Mayor of the town of the imminent danger of the eruption. Even after he manages to get the attention of local TV station manager, Paul Dixon, who was Harry's best man at"
A2,"Careful! Fight with your head don't fight with your heart boy!' shouted Bowen. The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter. But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code. Sir Bowen and all the kings princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. Knights followed a code of honor, the same code of honor that Sir Bowen's father and grandfather had followed. A code of honor is like a list of promises. Like rules that tell you how to live. A code is something you promise to do. Like promising to be good to your little sister. Or promising to clean up your toys. The knights in King Henry's England followed the Old Code. The king made them fight to protect his land and his people. And in return, knights lived according to the Old Code. The first rule of the Old Code said that a knight must never be a coward. A knight had to be brave. If a knight was a coward, he broke the code. The second rule of the Old Code said that a knight must never hurt his fellow knight. If a knight fought with his fellow knight, he was disgracing himself. The third rule said that a knight must help his fellow knight. He had to be brave when his fellow knight was in trouble. He had to be strong when his fellow knight was weak. The fourth rule of the Old Code was to never go back on your word. Never tell a lie, and never break a promise. The fifth rule of the Old Code said that a knight must love a woman with his whole heart. A knight must always be kind to her. The sixth rule of the Old Code said that"
A2,"The History of Farming Before people started farming they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. They started farming at this time because there were fewer wild food sources and their population was growing. They needed to find a way to grow their own food.

As more people started to farm, they developed new farming tools. Farmers found out that they could get more food if they planted their seeds in a straight line instead of scattering them randomly. So they planted rows of seed, and they used a simple tool called a hoe to turn over the dirt and make it easier for the seeds to grow.

Farmers also began to grow more than one type of plant in their fields. They found that if they planted different plants together, the crops would be healthier. This is because different plants help each other to grow better.

At first, farmers planted seeds by hand. But as time passed, they started to develop tools for planting seeds. They made a small stick with a pointy end and placed the seed at the end of the stick. Then they pushed the stick into the ground to plant the seed. This stick is still used in farming today.

Farmers also discovered that they could make their crops grow better by adding extra nutrients to the soil. They learned that different crops need different types of nutrients. So they began to rotate their crops so that the land would not become exhausted of certain nutrients. They also started to use fertilizers to add more nutrients to the soil.

A2,"ICE-FISHING If you drive north from Toronto for three hours you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter the lake becomes ice and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. The first ice-fishers come from very far away, even from America. They are so excited to see new places. The ice-fishers need special gear and when they arrive they use a pick-axe to break the ice. Then they make holes and put the fish right in their buckets. Some of the ice-fishers live in houses by the lake and they do not need to travel far. They have a wooden house and they live with their family. They use a generator to create electricity. This is for lights and for the radio to listen to. They also use the electricity for the TV so they can watch the hockey games in the evening. They can also cook on the wood stove and keep warm. The wood stove is the most important thing. On the weekend, the ice-fishers' friends come to visit. They have a big party and they eat ice cream. They are very happy, just like you and me.

Sometimes the weather is very cold and the ice-fishers cannot stay outside for long.

Sometimes the ice is so thin that it breaks when they walk on it. If that happens, the fish will swim away and the ice-fishers will not be able to catch any fish at all.

The biggest fish you can catch is a pike. You can eat this fish as a meal. If the pike is not big enough to eat, then the ice-fishers let the"
A2,"A man heard me and looked round. Then this big man saw me in the corn. He walked to me and I began to shout loudly: ' His foot is going to kill me ! ' The man stopped. For a minute he looked down at me carefully. (We look at a small animal in the same way and think: 'Will it hurt me? Will it help me ?') Afterwards, he smiled and walked away. I was a little frightened but I followed him. (I did not go nearer.)

I thought to myself: 'It is lucky that I am a small animal!' But it is not so true. For a man in the fields has all the reasons, if he wishes, to kill us. A man in the fields can help us or hinder us but he does not have to help or hinder us.

We have to work much to live. For a man, to live means to work. But we do it very simply, even in a beautiful world. When people say we are happy, I think they are not right. Sometimes we are sad. Sometimes we are angry. Sometimes we are afraid. But often we are afraid. Perhaps we are afraid of everything. Perhaps we are afraid of nothing.

I do not know, But I know this: in the past, men never wanted to help us. Now they can, but they do not. They do not help us. They do not hurt us. They do not care if they hurt us or if they help us.

I do not know why this is so. I can not see why it is. But I know this: it is no good to think of why. We can not change them or their work. We are too small and too little.

But we can change ourselves. When"
A2,"Memo To: All staff Subject: Holidays From: D Brown Date: 22.2.02 I am planning the holidays for next year. Please tell me when you would like to take your holiday. If possible could you give me two dates? Please give me your answer by the end of the month. Thank you. Dear D Brown, Firstly I would like to say that I am not sure why I was made to read this to the class. I would like to say though that I should be in my home, not at work when writing this reply. This is because I am a teacher. It is very obvious that I am not going to be at work anytime soon and therefore you will have to look after yourself whilst I am gone. Therefore I suggest that instead of asking us what our holiday times are (as if we give a monkeys) you consider when you have had your holidays and decide to come back to work, leaving us a note on the pin-board on the way out to indicate when you will be back. My recommendation would be that the rest of the teaching staff should do the same. Furthermore, I would like to say that this is a gross misuse of company property. It’s your memo, you should pay for it. I should also like to remind you that even if you are not at work, you still have a responsibility for the students under your care and you are obliged to inform the departmental head of your absence (and I don’t mean you just write it up in the memo). There will be no replies unless it is to question the reason behind this memo. Yours sincerely, The teaching staff. P.S. Can you tell us when your expected day of return is? Just for information purposes. P.S."

A2,"Big cats There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot! Tigers have special thick fur on their feet to protect them from cold ground or the spines of porcupines. There are many different species of cat but there are only six species of big cat:

1. Lions
2. Tigers
3. Jaguars
4. Leopards
5. Cheetahs
6. Snow Leopards

There are only six species of big cat but there are many different sub-species - different types within a species. There are about fifty different types of big cats in total. Lions are the only cats that live in a group and they sleep in a group called a pride. Tigers are solitary cats, they do not live in groups.

Did you know that a group of monkeys is called a tribe?

Fossil bones show that cats have been around for about 20 million years. Cats and humans have been neighbours for only about 7,000 years. Cats are one of the most important animals to have lived on earth. They eat lots of animals which helps to keep their population under control. For example, they keep the number of rats and mice down, which can cause a lot of damage to buildings.

The snow leopard is the largest cat that lives in the mountains. They live in the cold high places. Their coat has lots of thick fur to protect them"
A2,"Marco stood at the door of Silvia's flat and watched Gabriel leaving. He looked carefully at his clothes and his shoes. Why didn't Silvia open the door? She was in there. Then suddenly it opened. 'Silvia dear' Marco said 'you look wonderful ...' He stopped. Silvia didn't look wonderful. Her face was red and she looked unhappy. 'Please Marco, don't say anything.' She said. 'Why Silvia?' he asked. Then Silvia explained. 'I saw the two of you leaving the office together.' She started crying, 'Gabriel told me he liked me and wanted to be my boyfriend.' She stopped, 'But we just talked at the office... I don't think he told me that...' Marco looked at his shoes again and said 'Yes, that's true, maybe Gabriel was ... joking... Silvia, dear, I promise you I am telling the truth...' Marco hoped Silvia would believe him and they could start living happily.

The use of past simple in this text refers to events that have already happened, and the use of present perfect suggests an action that hasn't happened in the past, but it's already accomplished in the present moment.

Marco:
- Used past simple to say 'I watched Gabriel leaving' and 'I looked at my shoes'.
- Used present perfect to say 'I promise you I am telling the truth', referring to an action he hasn't done in the past, but he is doing it in the present moment.

Silvia:
- Used past simple to say 'I saw', 'Gabriel told me' and 'we just talked', referring to events that already happened.
- Used present perfect to say 'I don't think he told me that'. She thought"
A2,"'I am quite well' I always answered. Why did I say that? Why did I not ask for his help? Perhaps because in one sense it was true. I was not in pain. 'It cannot be the mysterious illness from the village' I thought. 'My illness is now three weeks old. It has lost its mysteries. It is no longer a mysterious illness but a very ordinary one.' It has become a part of myself. It has changed me. It has settled in my bones. Yet it is my own illness, it cannot be transferred.'

George Bernard Shaw's words express his experience of having contracted tuberculosis in 1893. Shaw had traveled to Switzerland to recover from tuberculosis, an illness that had been bothering him for three weeks. However, the illness had changed its course; it had become an ordinary illness that had affected his entire body, but not in a manner that he could transfer to someone else. Shaw's account of this disease shows us the way in which it affected his life and caused him to reassess his situation.

As with any disease, tuberculosis can cause different outcomes for different people. Its severity is not constant and may change depending on a variety of factors. While Shaw was able to eventually recover from this illness, the same cannot be said for all who contract it. In many cases, this disease can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, kidney failure, and even death. It is important to recognize the serious nature of this disease and the potential health risks that come with it.

One of the most common treatments for tuberculosis is antituberculosis drugs. These medications are used to combat the bacteria that cause"

A2,"BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window. This gives the burglars a good opportunity to get in. So it is important to keep doors and windows locked at all times.

Burglars don't just break in through doors or windows. They also look for other ways. For example, they sometimes open a fence to get in the garden. So, Inspector Saunders says, it is important to make sure you have strong fences.

It is also important to have good outside lights. Good lights can make the burglars think there are people at home. The lights can be put on a timer. It is even better if a neighbor agrees to turn the lights on when the burglars pass by. A dog is also a good guard.

You should be especially careful at the weekend or during the holidays when burglaries happen more often. And if you are going out for a few days, ask someone you trust to keep an eye on your home. Don't leave any tools in the garden. If a burglar finds tools, he might use them to break in.

Burglars are more likely to break into houses that seem empty. So always keep the curtains closed when you are out so that nobody knows you are not at home.

If you come home and think there is something strange, call the police immediately. Also, keep all the doors and windows locked even if you are at home.

A2,"Corryvale Farm Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months Stephen cuts this wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Then Jenny sells the wool to factories that make wool sweaters. She also sells the sheep's meat when it is dead. Jenny has six sheep that give wool, and six that give meat. Each sheep gives enough wool for 30 sweaters. But this wool doesn't need cutting as often as the other wool. The factories that Stephen and Jenny work with use these wool sweaters to make expensive clothes. The Blacklers don't get very much money for their wool and meat. The clothes that the factories make are very expensive. However, they know that their customers really like the wool sweaters. So the people who buy the clothes are happy and the Blacklers are happy because they have made enough money for their farm.

The Blacklers don't just want to make wool and meat. They also want to help the environment. So they grow trees and shrubs on their land. Jenny also makes special plants that stop erosion.

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. The Blacklers keep animals for milk, meat and wool. The farm is also a good place for nature. For example, they have a big field full of poppies, which are beautiful flowers.

A2,"The history of horse racing From the first history books ever written it is clear that horse racing has always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. These horses were incredibly fast, had a strong build and were considered great studs. They also had a strong influence on the horses of European nobility. They were so famous that a whole story was written about them – The Arabian Nights.

Nowadays horse racing is a popular sport across the globe. It is particularly popular in Australia, England, France, Japan, the United States and many other countries. The most famous race in the world is the Kentucky Derby in the USA, which is also known as the “Run for the Roses”. 

Horse racing today Horse racing in the 21st century involves thousands of professional jockeys, trainers and horse breeders. The horses race on either a flat track or an obstacle race track. They usually race about 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The races have many classes and can last from 800 to 4,000 meters. Horses need a specific set of abilities and characteristics to become a champion. They need to have a great build, stamina, a good temperament, and great speed.

The horses’ owners dress them up in bright and colourful silks, so they can be seen from a distance. Each horse also has a unique name and number.

The races are often followed by thorough medical checks, called veterinary inspections. These are done to see whether the horse"

I thought it was a special meeting. I wanted to be there. It was in a big hall. There were men and women sitting around the room. The Mayor was there and some important people from the council. Dad talked about Lynette. I wanted to know what he was saying but I couldn't hear it. Finally Dad sat down. I realized Lynette must be important. I wanted to know more about her. When we got home, Dad went straight to the study. I sat in the lounge and waited. Finally he came out and said 'The money is here'. 'What money?' I asked. 'The money for the new playground.' He was very happy. He put his arms around me and said 'I did it for you, Jude.' I didn't understand what he meant. Then he said 'Lynette would be very happy.' I knew then what he meant.

Line dancing is the latest craze to arrive in Britain. More and more people are going to dancing clubs and taking lessons because they enjoy it and it is also a good way of getting fit. At the same time, they can have a great time meeting other people.

Fiona Lever, a line-dancing teacher, says that anyone can learn to line dance. You do not have to be an expert, because you can follow the steps easily and quickly. According to her, 'If you have two feet and can walk then you can do it!'.

Many people who go to line-dancing classes do it to relieve stress. They really enjoy the classes. One person says 'The teacher doesn't bark at you to do this and do that. She is there to teach and make sure you enjoy it.

Do you think that line dancing could be a good activity for the whole family? In which ways do you think it could be of benefit?

One of the biggest appeals of line dancing for many people is that it is very social. 'You get together with lots of people and learn these steps, said one dancer. 'It's not like watching television or doing housework — you meet some new people and have some fun.'

For some people, line dancing is more than a fun activity. 'It helps"
A2,"Kong went back to Ann and took her down from the high rock. For the first time in this jungle she felt strangely safe. He jumped across a ravine and then across a river. She was a small plaything between his large fingers. Then he stopped and put her down.
“Is it so hot in the jungle or is it just me?” she asked.
Kong roared and shook himself. He threw her in a river and she was washed down and came out at a waterfall. Kong climbed up and took her in his hands again. She knew it was safe because she was not afraid.
Suddenly Kong roared again. He picked her up and started throwing her at trees. He hit the first tree with the full force of his gigantic hand. Ann screamed for help. Kong threw her at another tree.
“No more, no more, please let me down!” Ann begged for her life.
Kong dropped her.
Ann stood up and started to run. Kong reached out and grabbed her again. Ann turned to Kong and looked him in the eyes. Kong roared and opened his mouth wide. Ann was ready and jumped in his mouth and he swallowed her.
It was dark inside Kong’s belly. Ann tried to break the bones in her body so that Kong would vomit her out. But she couldn’t move any of her bones. She was in the dark and she was afraid. It wasn’t the jungle, it was Kong’s belly and that was much scarier.
Ann heard the thumping of his heart and felt the strong muscle movements. Then she realized it wasn’t that bad inside him. She decided to wait till he vomited her"

Please could you tell me what kind of food you like?
What books do you like?
Is there anything else you would like to tell me about yourself?

Dear Tom,

Thanks for your letter. I was very excited to receive it. Your handwriting looks so neat and proper.

You asked about my favourite colour. That's a tricky question! I love a lot of different colours. At the moment, I'd have to say purple is my favourite, but that can change any minute. What's yours?

As for food, I love spicy and tasty Indian food, but I also enjoy eating all kinds of foods from different countries. I really like to try new things. I hope one day you get to come to India and taste our delicious food. What's your favourite food?

About books, I enjoy reading anything I find interesting. I love mystery books, adventure books, and romance. I also like novels and poetry.

Her uncle a doctor made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris. She made wax figures of important people in France, England and Europe.

## Madame Tussaud's in London

In 1835, she moved to London and opened a museum on Baker Street. In 1884, a great fire destroyed the museum. Madame Tussaud made new figures and opened a new museum in Marylebone Road in 1884. Today Madame Tussaud's is a famous tourist attraction in London.

Inside Madame Tussaud's, people can see figures of famous people from all over the world. They can take pictures with the figures. Many movie stars, sports people, royalty, musicians and politicians have their figures in the museum. Some of the famous people in the museum are:

A2,"The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are quite near each other. On the road between them there are a lot of green hills and fields. On one of these hills is a picture of a very large man. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to him is called Cerne. This man is really very large – he is about 180 feet long and 30 feet high. The giant’s feet are much smaller than his head, which is very big and has two holes that look like eyes.

The giant is naked and he wears a very funny helmet on his head. The giant also has a big phallus which, it seems, is designed to scare people. Because of this huge member, the locals also call him the Cerne Giant Phallus, or just the Giant P.

It was a long time ago that the Cerne Giant was drawn on the hillside. Archaeologists say he was made about 2700 years ago, in the time of the Iron Age. At that time, people believed in many strange and frightening gods and spirits, and they thought that drawing pictures on the ground would help them to control these spirits. They thought that if they drew the giant, he would protect them from any evil spirits that were hiding in the land. 

One legend says that a Roman emperor was passing by the village of Cerne when he saw the giant. He was so impressed that he said the villagers would never have to pay taxes again if they made the giant much bigger and painted him. Unfortunately, this was a foolish emperor and he soon died a violent death. But the villagers did not want to make him angry so they decided to ignore his"

All rhinos have big heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The great body of the rhino stands on four short legs. A thick neck stretches up to support their wide, flat face. Two strong curved horns grow on the top of their snouts. The front feet have three toes and the back feet have four toes.

The Black Rhino

The Black Rhino is a type of rhinoceros that lives in the fields of South Africa. He has very short legs and thick grayish-brown skin with darker spots and marks on it. The Black Rhino weighs up to 1700 kg (3700 pounds). 

The White Rhino

The White Rhino is the larger of the two types of African rhinoceros, and unlike the black rhino, its wide mouth is built for grazing on grass. White rhinos have very large bodies with a round back and relatively small ears. White rhinoceroses live on open plains.

The Indian Rhino

The Indian Rhino is the smallest and also the most heavily built of the Asian rhinoceroses. The Indian rhinoceros is the largest land mammal found in India. It has a thick, brown coat and is known to inhabit grasslands, swamps, and forests. The Indian rhinoceros was once considered to be the only species of rhinoceros found in India.

A2,"CANADA GEESE Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there. Last spring Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. Bill loved watching the geese with their strong long necks.

One day Bill saw a group of Geese flying in a “V.” This showed the Geese knew something important about flying. The birds were working together in a very smart way. They were making the long flight south a lot easier. Bill was fascinated.

He wanted to learn more about geese, so he visited a local expert on birds. Bill found out that Geese stay together as a family group. The group is called a gaggle. When the gaggle is together, they honk to show they’re happy. But if the group is in trouble, they honk loudly and fly in a tight group. Then they can stay strong together and fight the danger. They can make a strong wind by flying together.

Bill learned that goslings, the young of Geese, learn to fly in the first few months of their lives. Geese can fly with one wing, even if the other is injured. They can also sleep in the air. They don’t need to walk on the ground much. This makes them good travelers.

Geese have excellent eyesight and can see far out on the ground and in the sky. They can even see the moon at night. Bill learned about a kind of goose called the Snow Goose. This Goose has a blue-gray neck. In winter, the Snow Goose turns completely"

The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. They came in many shapes and sizes. There are many kinds of dinosaurs. The two main groups were called meat-eaters and plant-eaters. The meat-eating dinosaurs were called carnivores. The plant-eating ones were called herbivores.

His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from the opera. His mother began to teach him the piano when he was six. His family moved to St. Petersburg and he studied with famous teachers at the Imperial Academy of Music.
Ivan was a virtuoso pianist, giving concerts on five continents. His performances became famous with audiences from Japan to Africa. Ivan often played with the Russian composer and orchestra conductor Alexander Borodin, who was his mentor and friend.
Ivan Petrov was awarded a gold medal for his talents as a pianist. As a virtuoso, he had the technique to play all pieces, even the hardest ones. He gave a performance at the age of twenty that caused a sensation in European concert halls. Ivan played a new piece, written especially for him by his friend, Alexander Borodin.

Ivan Petrov continued to play at the highest level until he retired. He played until his final years in public concerts, but mainly in charity concerts and for the Russian soldiers on the front in World War II.

Ivan Petrov's life, as well as his music, continues to be celebrated. His recordings are still popular among music lovers, and his performances are often broadcast on television and radio. Today he is remembered as one of the finest pianists of his generation.

He waited for other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. The next morning Serrano looked around the island that saved his life. He noticed that the island was a very peculiar place. It was full of strange animals and plants. Some of the plants had very sharp teeth and would bite people. Other plants could change their size. There were animals all over the island that could talk and read. And that is why Pedro Serrano is called the first man to discover the magical island of talking animals and strange plants. The end.

This is a story I made up on my own. It is called ""Pedro Serrano and the Magical Island"". It is about Pedro Serrano who swims to an island and discovers it's full of talking animals and strange plants. I would recommend this story to those who love to read about fantasy lands.

They went there to help make a road through a forest between two big towns. 'It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops where we could buy food' said Mary. 'We went to get some water every morning to the river. It took about half an hour to walk there.' 'When we arrived at the river, we had to walk through the water to get to the other side. It was freezing cold, because the mountains were so high.' 'One of the most exciting things during my holiday was when I met a local tribe. They were really friendly and I tried their food, ' said Mary. 'We were very tired after the work, but when we had finished, we stayed by the river to relax in the evening.'

'Perhaps the new king will come to the fight' thought the Archbishop. Sir Ector went to the fight with his two sons Sir Kay and young Arthur. 'We must defeat sir Lionel and his men' said Sir Ector.

There were so many knights on the field that they could not even see each other. Sir Lionel's men and Ector's men fought for a long time. Sir Kay was a good knight, but Arthur wasn't. He was good at fighting on the tournament field, but he never had a real fight. When his father and sir Lionel's men had fought long enough, Arthur asked to fight with Lionel's son, a knight as young and small as he.

They put on their armor and went to the field. Arthur was surprised at the youth of the knight and his handsome appearance. He didn't have as much armor and weapons as Arthur did. Arthur struck the first blow. His blow broke the other knight's helmet, making it fall of his head, and split the shield. The young knight was taken away, wounded. He never lived to be a man, and Arthur was very unhappy.

Meanwhile the fighting went on. Ector and Lionel were still fighting. Suddenly, Lionel cut down Ector's horse, so that he fell from his horse. Then Arthur saw his father falling. He had a sword and he fought hard. He killed one of Lionel's men and got to Lionel.

A2,"A great idea! Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys who grew up in the same small Canadian town. They have always been friends and classmates. Like all their other friends they enjoy going fishing or swimming at weekends. But for the last few months they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. What are they doing?

Peter came up with an idea. He had noticed that some of the websites on the internet were not available on the internet in his country. The websites were blocked by the government. So the two boys decided to work together to make these websites available for everyone again. This is what they have been doing on their weekends.

What they are doing sounds difficult, but it's not! They have learnt how to use a computer programming language to get around the blocks. This language is called PHP, which stands for ""hypertext preprocessor"". They are using it to create software which allows computers in their country to see websites that were previously blocked.

To make their work more effective, they've set up a company and called it Aeris Cloud. So far, they have made 20 different websites available. The boys are now planning to expand the business by providing this service to more people. We all have friends like Frazer and Peter. Sometimes we need to support and help each other in order to create a better world. Frazer and Peter's company is certainly helping people in their country, but what else can you do? You can find out by exploring these websites!

We started to believe Clayton too. It was only a story when he started and Clayton told very good stories. But as he talked about the ghost, we became very serious. We could feel his fear and it was real. He spoke to us very softly, with sadness in his voice. We were all very quiet. Clayton said the ghost came every night, but mostly, he kept himself hidden in the corner, or behind the door, and he only came out when he wanted something.

'What did he want?' we asked.

'He wanted to tell us stories about himself,' said Clayton. 'He said that when he was alive, he had lost everything that was dear to him. His family, his home, his friends, everything. And now, he has nobody to talk to. His life was very sad. He was so lonely.'

'Did he ever say why he came to your house?' we asked.

'No,' said Clayton. 'He didn't really say. But I think he chose my room because he heard me talking to my mother on the telephone one night and I told her that we were looking for my father. My father had gone away when my parents divorced and nobody knew where he was. It seems that the ghost thought that we could help him to find his family. He came to us because we knew how it felt to miss someone, how much it hurt.'

'But did he ever say where his family were?' asked Sanderson.

A2,"CROCODILES We can find crocodiles in tropical parts of the world for example Africa South America and Northern Australia. They spend most of the time in slow-moving water but they can move fast through the water and on land. You often see crocodiles together in large groups. They eat everything they catch like fish birds and small animals. Crocodiles are an endangered species because people are hunting them for their skin and meat. Crocodiles have the most sophisticated way of laying eggs. They lay between sixty to a hundred and twenty eggs in a nest and then they sit on it to warm it so the eggs will hatch.

SNAKES Some snakes have the longest tail in the animal kingdom, so they can have a top speed of over twenty five kilometres an hour. Some snakes are poisonous and can be dangerous if disturbed. Snakes can grow up to five meters long, for example, the Python, Boa, King Cobra, Anaconda. Most of them eat birds and small animals, and other small snakes. You find snakes in Africa, India, and Asia, and America.

FROGS and TOADS These creatures live in and near water. Frogs usually have a small body and long legs. They have large eyes and a wet, sticky skin. They use their sticky tongue to catch insects. Frogs breathe using their skin. Frogs lay their eggs in the water. Sometimes, they are brightly coloured, which can attract predators, so they have special chemical secretions to protect themselves.

TOADS are similar to frogs, but they generally have shorter legs and do not have a tadpole phase, like frogs do. Toads do not have teeth; instead,"

I am so sorry to hear about what happened to your school. What a sad and horrible thing to happen. And to think it happened only four days after I wrote to you. It's so sad to lose all your books and things. I wish I could give you some, but I didn't have much as a child. I never really liked school that much.

Everybody felt very bad but nobody was sadder than the Mayor. He thought about the many happy times he had with Jack. He remembered when Jack Skellington was born.

I am a big fan of A.A. Milne's original Puffin Books, as anyone who has followed my various posts over the years here on BlogExes would know. So I thought I would share my review of this classic Christmas tale, which has been delighting readers for over seventy years.

Tucked away in the Puck Building in New York City is the home of Puffin Books, one of the most important publishers in America. The company has a long history of publishing fine literature, including works by Jack London, Thomas Hardy, and Robert Frost, as well as many other award-winning writers.

The story begins with ""Once upon a midnight dreary"" and follows two boys who find themselves trapped in a house during a snowstorm. They decide to explore the house to find food and are soon caught up in a magical adventure. The illustrations are simple yet captivating, and the writing is charming and atmospheric.

The author of this book is an extremely talented writer who has written many wonderful stories. He is best known for his work on ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" series of books.

Puffin Books has been publishing some great new titles recently, and I am particularly excited about this one. It is a collection of short stories based on the"

A2,"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today there are policemen everywhere but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. The rich people lived in big houses while the poor lived in tiny rooms in the streets. Crime was beginning to become a problem in London. Sometimes people would rob others or attack them. There was also a problem with people breaking into houses and stealing things. The King, King George III, wanted to do something about all this crime. He asked his best friend, Robert Peel, to help. Robert Peel knew that if he was going to catch criminals he would have to get them before they could commit their crimes. So, Peel created a police force to protect the city.

THE PEELIAN PRINCIPLES OF POLICING The Peelian Principles of Policing are an unbroken line of thought from Sir Robert Peel's original concept of policing in 1829. They represent the basic philosophy and beliefs upon which modern policing rests.

THE PEELIAN PRINCIPLES
I - To prevent crime and disorder.
II - To maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.
III - To recognize always that the extent to which the cooperation of the public can be secured diminishes"

Elliott's mom Mary took a light and then she and the boys went into the yard. ""What did you see?"" Mary asked Elliott. ""Something there"" he answered. He pointed at a spot under the big oak tree. Mary looked and saw the orange peel. ""Someone must've thrown it over the fence from their yard,"" Mary said. ""Well, whoever it is I'd like to thank them! It's not every day you get an orange"" Mary said smiling as she threw the peel over the fence. Elliott and Tyler just looked at her.

Sometimes she stopped and listened. She came to a door with a light under it. It was the kitchen. She pushed the door open and the warm light flooded into the hall.

'What are you doing, Peter?' she asked, looking into the kitchen. Peter looked at his wife, then at the kettle on the stove.

'I can't sleep. It's too quiet!' he said. 'I was going to make a cup of tea. Would you like one?'

'I'd love one', Mary replied. 'But why don't you use the electric kettle? This one uses too much gas.'

'The gas one makes a lovely hissing sound,' Peter said. 'I like the sound of the water boiling. Otherwise I can't sleep. I don't know why.'

He looked at his wife again. 'Are you cold, Mary? We could light the fire. We should really light it. This room is cold and the windows are old. We should replace them.'

Mary looked at Peter. 'Peter,' she said, 'I don't know how to tell you this, but ... you are snoring!'

A2,"Parrots Perhaps you have seen these beautiful birds with their lovely colours and long tails in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil Australia and India. They usually live in large groups and because they like to eat fruit they are sometimes a problem for farmers. However, parrots are very friendly and like to talk with people. They can even learn to say a few words! In fact some parrots can become good pets.

Parrots are one of the most colourful and playful of all bird groups.

Parrots

Parrots are one of the most colourful and playful of all bird groups. With more than 300 different species, you can find parrots in most parts of the world. Because they like to eat fruits, seeds, nectar, and even insects, they do very well in a variety of habitats.

Many parrots are very social and live in groups of up to 20 birds. They are found in forests, grasslands, and even mountains, and they can live 50-80 years in captivity. But despite these impressive qualities, many parrots are threatened with extinction because people are cutting down their forests.

Parrots are among the most social of all birds and can live with up to 20 birds in one group.

A2,"From: Greg To: Anna Hi Anna I’m not having a very good week! Yesterday my team had a volleyball match but we lost. The other team played much better than we did! Then my friend Jeff who lives in Australia telephoned with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he's got a summer job. I'm really disappointed about this. Can you believe that it's already Friday again? I just want to go home and take a long weekend break! I hope everything is going well with you. Look forward to hearing from you. Love Greg xx

Hi Greg, how are you doing? I'm sorry to hear that you had a bad week. It's not nice to lose. As for Jeff, well, I always think that it's important to have work experience during the holidays. Even though I'm sorry that he won't come to visit you, I also think that he is doing a good thing by getting a job. It's a good opportunity for him and it shows that he's a responsible person. And he'll earn money too. Sometimes we have to be happy for other people and accept that we can't always get what we want. That's life! We should always look on the bright side. It was nice to receive your message today, though. I enjoyed reading it. 🙂 Hope everything will improve. I wish you a great weekend! Take care of yourself. Love Anna xxx

A2,"The airplane flew through a blue sky. Alan pulled his hat over his eyes and fell asleep. Hours later he woke up and looked out the window. He could see Isla Sorna. It was very green. The plane flew down to the island and suddenly Alan felt excited. ""Look!"" he said. His friends looked and saw a group of dinosaurs. Alan and his friends jumped with joy. They were on a dinosaur expedition and Isla Sorna was perfect.

All the kids loved the story and cheered for Alan. The class listened as Ms. Greer read the rest. They all hoped to get dinosaur toys that year. In the afternoon, Ms. Greer announced that the kids would be creating their own Isla Sorna stories. Many kids cheered for this announcement while others groaned. Most of the kids had been practicing their stories since the morning. They were eager to share their work with their classmates.

The story of the dinosaur expedition was based on the movie of the same name. It's a story that gets kids excited and brings out the explorer in them. Use it as a fun writing activity in your class to spark creativity and curiosity. It will also inspire the young readers to learn more about dinosaurs and their world.

This short story idea can be used as a model for creative writing and writing workshop activities. It's an excellent topic for a class storybook where each student contributes a chapter or paragraph, or a great group project where students collaborate on the story. You could also use this as a springboard for discussions about dinosaurs and their habitats, island exploration, and teamwork.

But she couldn't stand up and the other dogs attacked her again and again. Buck couldn't move. He felt very sad. He watched as the other dogs attacked the little dog without stopping.

Did you find that difficult? Well, don't feel bad. It's not a simple English text. In fact, it's a short story which we call a ""Text"". The term Text is used in English classes and refers to the main passage students study as a group or individually. It's usually more challenging than a paragraph, but it can also be shorter.

In English Language and Literature, the term text is commonly used to indicate a part of a work, like a book, chapter or even poem.

They couldn't eat them all so they carried some for their dinner later. They were happy. They went on their way rejoicing.
I want to say that this is a story of a group of people who caught fish and then did many different things with them. They caught the fish from a lake or a pond. They probably ate most of them. They shared them with their friends. They ate some of them for breakfast and others for dinner. They used the leftover fish for their dinner. This was a story of a happy and enjoyable day.

A2,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop age 14 Last summer I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. A long line of elephants entered with their Mahout riding on each one. They were all performing different tricks like standing on their back legs and lifting the other leg up high. There was a baby elephant that did a few tricks like sitting on a ball and taking a bow. This was so exciting that the audience clapped and cheered. The show was entertaining and we all enjoyed it very much. My favorite part was when the elephant picked up a little boy off the ground and put him on top of its head. The boy came down and climbed back on the ground. The elephant then picked up the little boy again and put him on the ground. This happened three times and the audience clapped and laughed every time. After the show the elephants walked all around the park with their Mahout showing visitors how to ride them. My friend Tad wanted to have a go and he sat on the elephant while it slowly walked around. We watched him for a while and took photos. It was a fun day and we had a great holiday. Elephant Shoes by Daniel Allsop age 12 One day in Thailand I went to a shoe shop with my family. It was a hot day and we were all in a hurry. When we entered the shop there were a lot of shoes and my eyes wandered. Then I saw them, a pair of elephant shoes. They were huge and funny. I had to try them on. I"

A2,"Mount Kilimanjaro Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are several paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists. One of the most difficult paths is the nine-kilometre Lemosho path. This route is longer but less crowded than the other routes.

It takes about seven days. The mountain has five zones - cultivated land, cloud forest, heath and moorland, alpine desert and ice cap. Every zone is very different. This means that climbers are always challenged as they move higher.

It has three volcanic cones. One of them, called Kibo, is the highest. The mountain was formed about 750,000 years ago and was once taller than the Eiffel Tower. It was made from lava and is still active. Scientists have never measured its depth, but they say it could be as deep as 600 metres. Mount Kilimanjaro is also home to several rare animals. It is home to some species of plants that are found no-where else.

You don't have to be super-fit to climb the mountain. You do need to prepare, but you can always go back down if you have to. It is not a cheap activity, however, and you will need lots of warm clothes. People who reach the top are rewarded with an amazing view of the surroundings.

It's not just for fun. The money raised by climbers is used to support poor local people. You may be helping to feed a child"
A2,"Stop the ship! This is too dangerous"" Hayes said to Englehorn. ""We'll get out of here and find better weather"" Englehorn said. ""How much water is under the ship?"" he asked his sailors. Every man on the ship wanted an answer to that question. Englehorn and Hayes didn't know this way. They needed the sailor's information. After hearing the answers, Englehorn gave orders to abandon the ship. As the sailors evacuated the ship, they looked at the captain and first mate in shock. In a matter of minutes the ship was in shambles. All that was left was wreckage. Englehorn and Hayes were standing side by side on a piece of debris. ""This was a mistake. It was too dangerous"" Hayes said to Englehorn. Englehorn shook his head and said, ""No it was not. We are alive and we can come back for the ship.

The prompt that inspired this text is ""This is too dangerous"". The two people who were speaking throughout the narrative were Englehorn and Hayes. They were having a discussion about the state of the ship and whether or not they should abandon the ship. When Englehorn finally ordered everyone to get off the ship, Hayes was not happy about it and he later said that abandoning the ship was a mistake. In response, Englehorn disagreed and claimed that they were right to leave, because they were still alive.

In terms of character development, both Englehorn and Hayes have shown their dedication to the ship. Despite the danger, they wanted to stay and try to get through it together. However, they were both aware of the risk they were taking, and they recognized the need to be alive in order"

B1,"The Young Achiever of the Year Kal Kaur Rai has always been interested in fashion and has just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since she was a child she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her hard-working parents who own a supermarket that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. At just 17, she is already planning to become the CEO of her own fashion label. She says she wants to make it easier for teenagers to buy clothing and provide jobs for young people in her community.

#### What is Your Inspiration?

I would say my main inspiration for fashion is the youth of today. I believe it is important to cater to our generation and create a brand that speaks to us and our lifestyle. As a fashion designer, I am determined to give my youth the opportunity to express themselves without limitations or boundaries.

#### Who’s Your Role Model?

My role model in the fashion industry is the iconic designer Tom Ford. His work is awe-inspiring and I love the way he can transform a simple garment into something breathtaking. His unique ability to create a signature look that embodies sexiness and sophistication is something I aspire to achieve in my own work.

#### What’s the Future of Fashion?

The future of fashion is heading towards a more ethical direction. As young designers, it is our responsibility to contribute to this movement and create garments that are not only fashionable but also sustainable and ethically sourced. I believe this will not only benefit the environment but also add value to the garments we create.

#### What Makes Your Brand Different?

My brand is different because it is a reflection of my personality and passions"
B1,"THE ICEHOTEL For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. One of the many hotels in Jukkasjärvi, near the Arctic Circle, was called Icehotel. The winter of 1989 saw the hotel and the village become famous when it was used to shoot the James Bond movie The Living Daylights. Over the years, Icehotel has been voted the best winter attraction in Sweden and even in the world, and has grown to become the largest hotel made of ice in the world.

The hotel was created with a vision of art in the snow and ice and each year, artists from all around the world are invited to create designs for the Icehotel and the Art Suites. It’s a hotel experience that’s hard to forget, and some guests are known to return year after year to take a dip in the ice-cold ice baths.

There are many activities at Icehotel during the winter, and it’s a good opportunity to get to know the art of ice sculpting. You can learn to sculpt snow in the Icehotel’s Snow Bar, watch ice-carving demonstrations, or even try your hand at it yourself.

The Icehotel has several different rooms:

1) Art Suites
These suites are designed by artists every year. They are luxurious and comfortable rooms, even with art pieces.

2) Deluxe Double Rooms

Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It was going to be a two day journey. We were a group of six climbers from different parts of the country. Our goal was to reach the summit of the mountain that was 4,412 feet (1,345 meters) high. We reached the base of the mountain at 9am. and we began climbing up an enormous ice cliff. It was very slippery, very cold and very steep. The temperature was about -3 degrees centigrade and there were only a few wisps of cloud floating about in the blue sky. I was wearing a fleece jacket and a pair of denim jeans, but it was not enough. The wind was icy and my hands and feet were going numb. We took our first break after about two hours climbing. Our guide had made us a hot drink which was lovely and helped warm us up a little. But as I stood there looking at the mountain ahead, I could see the wind whistling over the ice on the cliff face and it felt really cold. We continued on and by lunch time the temperature had dropped to -5 centigrade. But we soldiered on and reached the crest of the north face about half an hour before sunset. We put up our tents and slept early. I don't know how I managed to sleep that night. It must have been freezing cold in the tent. The temperature must have got down to -10"
B1,"Being an older student At 32 I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary although I was earning a reasonable amount of money I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. I also did not have a lot of social contact with other people outside of work. When I took my children to the zoo I met a group of students who were all planning a trip abroad. After some talking I found out that they were biology students and I was very interested by that. I quickly decided that I would go back to school, get some qualifications and become a biologist. However, this was easier said than done.

I was now faced with the problem of going back to school and actually doing well. It took a long time to remember how to study and at first it was difficult to fit in with a whole new group of students. I found that if I was to succeed in my goal I would need to learn to study regularly and not miss any classes. Being 32 and having young children I also decided to join a student society. The student society was a very friendly group who would occasionally get together to have some fun and enjoy each other's company.

I quickly realized however that I did not just want to make friends and have fun. I wanted to get the best degree possible so I could become a biologist. I had always had a keen interest in the world of biology and I knew I would really enjoy the subject I was studying. To become a good biologist I needed to study regularly and take in as much information as possible. During my first year I had found it difficult to read large amounts of text quickly"
B1,"No Title When I injured my back I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. Some of them put men and women on different starts or had separate races altogether. Some just didn’t seem to care about female runners. So I decided to do something about that. My running club, I’m the Runs for Women and Girls club, currently has over 200 members in it.

We organise running events for people of all ages and abilities, even for people who have never run before. We have an annual fun run where people can try out running, see if they enjoy it, and then decide if they want to join the club. We’re also able to provide people with the opportunity to run in events such as the Great North Run and other local races. My club has even attracted attention from several athletes, including one Paralympian and one international athlete.

We want to promote the fact that running doesn’t have to be all about running fast and competitive racing. Running can also be about having fun and exercising in a way that is enjoyable. We even have our own events and races for the members of the club. These range from 5k park runs, all the way up to half marathons. We want to continue to develop and grow our club so that we can reach as many women and girls as possible and allow them to enjoy running.

I had to take a break from my own running career because of a back injury, but I am confident that with the work we"
B1,"Grass Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are over 9000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. Many cultures have their own beliefs about grass such as the Chinese who believe it is a symbol of life, abundance and vitality.

Grasses are vital plants for life on earth and the reason we have the animals and plants we have in various places. Without grass we would not have the fertile soils we need to grow food and other plants to support life on earth.

Grass has evolved with humans to assist them with their needs and it has changed with them. The development of domesticated grasses such as wheat, barley and rice has been one of the keys to human survival and the evolution of civilizations.

Without grass we would not have paper, fabrics and many other goods that are made from grass fibres. In addition to these practical uses, the beauty of grass has also moved artists and photographers who have inspired us with pictures and words about the beauty of the grasslands and what they represent.

Grass has also been used in scientific experiments to help improve the plants that we grow for food, clothing and shelter. Through biotechnology we can now transfer genes from one type of grass to another so that the plant grows better in difficult conditions or has a different appearance.

With such a large number of grass types we can always find new uses for them that we haven't thought of yet. They will continue to be vital for the survival of our planet and its inhabitants.

B1,"Maria Mutola In 1988 Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl in an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. 'We won' she said. 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.' The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha who had encouraged other African athletes learnt about Maria. He saw potential, approached her and offered a scholarship to a sports academy in East Germany. In 1996 she was part of the national athletics team that won a silver medal at the Olympics. She went on to win two gold medals at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, becoming the only woman ever to win two gold medals in the same track event. She became a four-time Olympic silver and bronze medalist and an eight-time world champion. In a world that has often overlooked or underestimated the athletic capacity of African athletes, she was a revelation.' She retired from athletics in 2010.

The story of Maria Mutola's life and achievement serves as a testament to the fact that no matter one's environment or background, talent and potential are universal. The most potent factor in determining how far someone can go in life is not usually their talent or potential. It is often the opportunity they get to apply that talent or potential. What Maria Mutola's story and the story of other top athletes around the world proves is that if we invest adequately in people, if we provide a platform for them to develop their talents, there is no limit to what they can achieve.

If Maria Mutola was discovered early and provided with the needed support and exposure to develop her talent, it could have been different. We might have had the chance to see more of her"
B1,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival an annual nine-day event. The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station.

It has since become a very popular event that attracts hot air balloonists from around the world. During the festival a large number of colourful hot air balloons take to the sky with thousands of people below looking up. People come to this festival to watch the many hot air balloons that fill the sky. There are also many other activities for them to enjoy. The Albuquerque balloon festival is not only fun, but it helps to raise money for local charities as well.

In addition to the launching of hot air balloons, other activities such as craft fairs, live music performances, and food vendors provide a festive atmosphere. The festival is a massive affair that lasts for nine days and has grown from just over 30 hot air balloons in 1972 to over 500 today.

Over the years it has become a popular tourist attraction, especially for families and has drawn tens of thousands of visitors each year. In addition, ballooning competitions and balloon glow shows at nighttime are held. In the glow shows, the balloons are inflated and anchored, then their burners are ignited to illuminate the balloon envelopes, a very impressive sight.

The Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta is the largest hot air ballooning event in the world, a celebration of colour and joy. It is a spectacular event for balloon pilots"

B1,"THE ROCKIES The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America. They start in the North-west but lie only a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies but the best way to see them is to travel by train. There are many different railroads which pass through the Rockies. There is a train called 'Rocky Mountaineer' but the most famous is probably the 'Canadian Pacific Railroad' which runs from Montreal to Vancouver. Along the route you can see awe-inspiring scenery including lakes, forests, mountains, and waterfalls. There is also a long train called 'Amtrak'. This runs from Chicago to Seattle passing the Rockies near the Canadian border. It is not as fast as the Canadian Pacific but it is cheaper. However if you want the fastest train go to Denver, in Colorado, and get on the Burlington Zephyr. This is a sleek, modern train which leaves at 7am and reaches Chicago by 8pm. In the summer, when the weather is clear and sunny, the Rockies are at their best. It is a very popular holiday time and many holidaymakers go to the Rockies. During the rest of the year, snow and ice make the Rockies very dangerous and it is often difficult to cross them.

1. Which continent is the Rockies found? 2. In which areas can the Rockies be found? 3. What type of scenery will you see along the route of the Rocky Mountaineer? 4. How long does the Burlington Zephyr take from Denver to Chicago?

B1,"Little Chefs For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. One boy is taught how to make a traditional Italian dish, fresh pasta, by using his hands to roll it out and cutting it into long strips. Afterwards his mother said he had learned something valuable. ""If he can cook for himself, then he will never get take-aways and will eat healthy food."" Parents are also happy that the young chefs develop some independence and gain confidence. 0

Question: What is this text mainly about?

Options:
A. Teaching children traditional cooking
B. A fun cooking class for children
C. Helping children develop confidence
D. The role of food in children's life
Answer: B. A fun cooking class for children
Source: Newspaper article/ report
Details: The text is mainly about a cooking class for children aged between ten and fifteen years old. They are taught serious cooking in a weekly class. This course is very popular, and many children want to join it. Parents are happy when their children learn to cook by themselves and to make a healthy choice of food. The text does not mainly talk about traditional cooking, confidence, or the role of food in children's life.

The most important question: Why does the author say that some parents pay so much money for such classes? It seems a bit strange, doesn't it? But the text says, ""Parents are also happy that the young chefs develop some independence"
B1,"Detective-Inspector Cornish and Chief-Inspector Craddock were discussing the murder at the local police station. 'Mrs Bantry said that Marina Gregg had a ""frozen look""' said Cornish. 'Did she see someone on the stairs? There were two people from America - Ardwyck Fenn and Lola Brewster a film star. They seemed to get on well with Mrs Bantry, perhaps that could be why Mrs Bantry was called a liar at the party'  The two Inspectors looked at each other thoughtfully.

This year’s crime writing festival at St Mary’s Church, Petworth, West Sussex, was a glorious day of sunshine and shade. It took place on Saturday 29th June, and I was there to meet the wonderful Ruth Rendell. She’s never married, no children, a writer who has been through the mill but seems to emerge on the other side of it a lot stronger and more resilient, having grown up as she has. I thought her life story might add a different perspective to the story of her mystery writing career. Ruth Rendell was born in London in 1930 and grew up in an area that was, at the time, a haven for artists and intellectuals, in what is now referred to as Bloomsbury, the epicentre of the British literary and artistic avant-garde. Her father was a successful lawyer and her mother an aspiring actress who never made it to the stage because she was uninterested in memorizing scripts. By the time she was born, her parents’ marriage had already begun to founder.

She left school at 16 to work in publishing, but her first love was writing. In 1950 she was accepted into"
B1,"A few days after this Virginia and her young admirer went out riding in the fields. But a tree tore her riding skirt very badly and when they got home she went up the back stairs to mend it. She was running past the half-open door of one of the rooms when she saw someone inside. It was her father. In the act of looking at the pictures on the mantelpiece.

Mary had forgotten to ask him for anything to put on her injuries, and the sight of him there with that half-open door made her blush and she went to get some bandages. She felt a strange feeling of fear. She returned to the door where she had seen him and found that it was half-closed again and she heard his voice talking to himself as he looked at the pictures.

Mary then asked him if he would like a cup of tea, and her father said yes. She went back to the door and there was a light in the room and he was looking in the mirror. At this sight, she could not tell him, and she ran down the stairs. She was very distressed and upset.

A while later her father came into the kitchen where she was busy making the tea and said, ""Mary, I was just having a look at my pictures,"" he added, ""when I noticed your skirt which must have been torn quite badly."" Then he went over to his study and took off his coat to change his shirt.

From that time Mary remembered all the times she had wanted to speak to her father about her troubles and the fact that she had forgotten to ask him for something to put on her injuries haunted her. In fact, Mary's father never found out about her injuries and neither did anyone"
B1,"Winter Driving Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow waiting to send you off the road. Snow falls and covers all signs, and plow trucks cannot reach them all. But that is nothing compared to the snow, rain, and the salt mixture that the roads are soaked with. The mixture is called snow and ice, or a winter wonderland, or an icy death trap. As I drive down the snowy roads I get angry when I see all the people not being cautious. They drive fast, not paying attention and cause danger for everyone else. People need to think of their own safety and the safety of others. It is important to know what the road conditions are and what kind of weather is ahead. In winter driving, it's critical to maintain a safe speed and adequate following distance between vehicles. 90% of all winter driving accidents occur within 10 miles of home on days when roads are clear of snow and ice. And 90% of those accidents occur when the driver was going too fast. One of the most common reasons for an accident is a driver not seeing the road or another vehicle in time. Many car headlights are not designed to work well in snow and ice. The glare from snow makes it hard to see other vehicles on the road. There should be no distractions in the car. 26,000 people die every year due to car accidents. 2/3 of those accidents could have been prevented if people would slow down and maintain proper following distances. People should stay in control"

She was discovered by the driver after he had completed a trip of over 500 kilometres. It was the end of a long day. The van had left in the morning, headed to the north of England from the home of retired trucker Dave Funnell in Plymouth, Devon. Bo disappeared from home early that day and had no idea where she was going. But she returned home safely a day later after she had been discovered by the driver.

B1,"The next day Emma was pleased to see a lot of snow outside. This was a good thing because it meant she could not go to church and see Mr Elton or go to visit Harriet and none of them could meet. The snow stayed for several days after Christmas and the only visitor to Hartfield was Mr Knightley.

When the weather warmed a little, the snow began to melt and soon after that, the floods started. The Thames was rising up and so, even though Mr Woodhouse did not want anyone to risk their lives in the cold weather, they had to start worrying about floods. The rain kept coming on the third day and it caused a huge flood in Doncaster.

So while Emma was very happy with this snowy Christmas, Mr Woodhouse was not so sure about the weather. He was anxious about the floods and hoped that everyone would stay out of harm’s way and be safe.

# Questions

1. Was Emma happy with the snowy Christmas?

2. How did Mr Woodhouse feel about the weather?

3. What happened on the third day of the floods?

# Answers

1. Yes, Emma was happy with the snowy Christmas.
2. Mr Woodhouse was anxious about the weather.
3. The floods got worse and caused a huge flood in Doncaster.

# Hints

1. The first sentence of the story says that Emma was pleased to see a lot of snow outside.
2. Mr Woodhouse did not want anyone to risk their lives in the cold weather, so he was worried.
3. At the bottom of the story, it says that “the rain kept coming on the third day"

B1,"Moonshine The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ‘Here again’ is a followup to ‘The Waves’. There have been a few changes since the last CD with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums. However the band is not deterred by these set backs and it was good to see them play live at their launch concert at St Mary’s church, Guildford.

Moonshine’s music is a fusion of Jazz, folk and psychedelia and their first track on the new CD, ‘Here again’ is a fine example of this. The band are known for their eclectic mix of styles and influences which sets them apart from other local bands. The title track ‘Here Again’ was written by Wilbur Phillips, a musician known for his work with Van Morrison and is an evocative song about lost love and recollections of times gone by.

Moonshine have a unique approach to making music and have a loyal fan base for their distinctive sound. It is evident that they have made their mark in the local music scene, and with new members, they are looking to the future with much anticipation.

The album is due to go on sale soon at Waterstones in Guildford, and can also be found online at www.myspace.com/moonshineband . The band will be playing a special launch gig at The Star Inn, Guildford on 26th March.

B1,"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST Hypatia was born in Alexandria in Egypt in 370 A.D. For many centuries she was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books. Hypatia's father was director of Alexandria University and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual as most women then had few opportunities to study.
Hypatia was well known throughout the Roman Empire as a mathematician, inventor, philosopher and astronomer. Hypatia's major contribution to science was in developing and teaching a way of learning called the ""Corpus of Hypatia"" - a collection of the best knowledge of the day. This helped to spread Greek philosophy and ideas on geometry.
Hypatia used her skills and education to spread the message of tolerance between people of different beliefs. For this reason, she was particularly hated by a group of Christian zealots who eventually killed her. The murder of Hypatia is still an example of what can happen when science and religious dogma clash.

B1,"Joining the Kirov Ballet I’m Nathalie. Last year I was one of the youngest foreign students ever to join the Kirov’s ballet school in St Petersburg Russia. At my first ballet class I was nervous as I didn’t know anyone. Everyone gathered round asking me questions all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. That was the start of a very tough year. As much as it was the start of a year of hard work and no free time, I learned a lot during that year.

When I first arrived in Russia there was a language barrier. Everything was so different and strange to me and to begin with I did not like it. But I kept on pushing through the hard times and now I love it so much. I started off speaking with one Russian word ‘Spasibo’ which means thank you. It was the only Russian word I knew. Now I can have a conversation in Russian and I understand what the dancers are saying.

Throughout the year I formed strong bonds with some of the Russian dancers. My closest friends are Alisa and Masha. We are together most of the time. They really do make my time there special and fun. We have an amazing connection and I feel like I have known them for years.

During the year, we have traveled around Russia performing for people all over the country. This has been an amazing experience as I have seen parts of Russia that most people never get to see. Also, the adrenaline rush that comes with being on stage is amazing.

After our performances we have to go straight to the hotel for rest, a shower and then to a Russian meal. These Russian meals have opened my eyes to a completely new type of cuisine. It took me a while to"
B1,"Norwich Norwich the capital of the part of Britain known as East Anglia has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years. It began as a small village beside the River Wensum. At the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 it had grown to become one of the largest towns in England.

We had the pleasure of visiting this fascinating city twice in the last six months, but I would love to go there again someday.

There is a lot of history here to explore, from the medieval to the modern. This is seen in the Gothic cathedrals and in the modern shopping mall that is home to the cities most famous icon, the Castle Mall shopping centre, which is housed within the tower of the old Norwich Castle.

## Exploring Norwich

The city’s most famous landmark is Norwich Castle which dates back to 11th century and is an iconic sight in this city.

Norwich Cathedral also deserves a visit. It’s one of the finest examples of Norman architecture in the UK.

Elm Hill is said to be one of the prettiest streets in England. This is an area of traditional brick and timber-framed medieval buildings with cobbled streets and the occasional surprise find such as the hidden Elm Hill garden.

## Norwich’s History

During the medieval period, Norwich had a population of around 14,000 people. This is quite a small population by modern standards, but in medieval times this would have been considered a very large and prosperous town.

Norwich has always been an important centre for trade, especially wool and cloth. In medieval times it was"
B1,"Sharks  Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. This essay looks at some of the things sharks eat and also what other types of danger there are in the sea.

First, sharks eat a variety of food and there are different sharks to feed on different things. Some sharks live near the bottom of the sea or even at the top. The bottom feeders include the bottom sharks, angel sharks, wobbegong sharks, and epaulette sharks, while the top feeders are the lemon sharks, tiger sharks, and white sharks. This shows that sharks have a wide variety of food to eat.

On the other hand, there is another danger that is out there in the sea, even more dangerous than the sharks, which is the Great White. The great white shark is the most dangerous animal to ever swim through the seas and oceans. Its body is covered with scars from the fights that it has had with other sharks or with seals or whales. These scars make it look more like a monster and frighten most people who swim in the oceans. These animals are not dangerous to humans but if you happen to swim in the sea where they swim you will need to get out quickly.

In conclusion, there are many dangers out there in the seas but the shark is a most famous and well-known of them all. They have eyes that are perfectly suited for hunting and feeling special lines"
B1,"Sweden's Ice Hotel The village of Jukkasjarvi is in Swedish Lapland and winter temperatures there can reach -40° C. But 6000 holidaymakers still go there annually to visit what is probably Europe's most unusual accommodation. In this hotel you eat drink and sleep in rooms made of ice. If you want you can even get married in one. In the winter all the snow has to be cleared away just to allow people to get close to the hotel. In the middle is a frozen lake. And outside the ice hotel is a bar where visitors can enjoy the local drink; cloudberry juice. The hotel is only open for five months a year. It is built every autumn from 500 tonnes of ice. And every spring it is completely destroyed. The ice hotel is 20 years old and costs 20 million krona to build. (07.11.07)

In the centre of the Ice Hotel's bar and one of the 60 ice rooms. There are also three suites which are more expensive to rent, and each suite has its own ice fireplace.

In the hotel, people can hire out ice sculptures for private celebrations. Or they can be sold to them. Prices range from 20,000 to 45,000 krona.

There are around 60 rooms in the hotel. Half of them are small two person rooms and half are family rooms that can sleep 3 to 5 people.

The Ice Hotel will welcome its one millionth guest this winter. But as most people only stay for one or two nights, there are a lot of people who don't know about it.

The hotel is surrounded by a large number of snow houses,"
B1,"CARTOON FILMS Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something you can make it move on the cinema screen. The use of new ideas and advanced computer programs means that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children.

However, recent years have seen the rebirth of cartoon films.

First, it's the way cartoons are created. In the past, drawing cartoons was a very time-consuming process. A person would draw a character, then shoot it on film. Then he would draw the next picture, and so on. When all the pictures were drawn, he would watch them on film and then put them together, one by one, in order. When the film was finished, he would have to draw all the pictures again if he wanted to make any changes. Nowadays, computers make it possible to create animated films in half the time and with fewer people.

Second, the way cartoon films are shown. Cartoons were once shown in the morning or afternoon on TV, or shown on Saturday morning in cinema theatres. Now, cartoon films play all day on special ""family"" channels. These films are designed to be appreciated by all, and are often shown on the same channel as a film with a similar theme, such as a film for children or a science fiction film.

Third, the subject matter of cartoons. During the 1980s, there was a move toward more sophisticated plots and characters. These cartoons were often funny and exciting, and were enjoyed by adults, not just children. For example, _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ and _Beauty and the Be"
B1,"No Title The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six"" says Margaret Porter a violinist and music teacher. ""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret who lives in London prefers to take pupils at three and four although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. She teaches children at home and in music schools around the UK and also visits schools for concerts, workshops and talks.

Margaret, who has spent 20 years as a professional violinist and nine as a teacher, says that a young child is easily able to handle the small size of a violin and make friends with their instrument.

She adds: ""The reason they are so receptive to learning at this age is because of their incredible brain development. We all know that children at that age pick up language very quickly. They also do it very naturally with no formal teaching.""

Their innate curiosity also helps. ""They have so many questions, and this curiosity helps to teach them very quickly and easily. When they are two they may not be ready, but between three and six is ideal. After this age their natural curiosity can be affected by school work.""

Margaret says that the first year of learning is always the most difficult. ""Once they have mastered some basic skills, they can progress quite quickly.""

She says that if children show a real love for music, it's worth going with it, even if it means sacrificing other activities for a while. But it's important to make sure the child wants to do it. ""Don't push a child into playing an instrument. It is a long-term commitment. They need to be really interested in it.""

B1,"SAMUEL PEPYS The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting description of everyday life in England between 1660 and 1669. Pepys writes about important news stories of the time like disease an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames and the Great Fire of London. There are also details of his personal life.

When and Why it was Written

Samuel Pepys's diary, also known as 'The Diary of Samuel Pepys', was written during one of the most turbulent periods of British history. Pepys wrote about his experiences, his ideas, his beliefs, and his fears. The Great Plague, the Great Fire of London, and the Restoration of the British Monarchy are some major events that he recorded in his diary. In a more general sense, the diary offers a unique window into 17th-century British life.

Pepys wrote the diary because he wanted to record the events that were happening around him. He also wanted to preserve his memories. Like many of his contemporaries, he was worried that he would forget important things that happened during his life. By writing about them in his diary, he ensured that he would not forget them.

Moreover, Pepys intended to produce a biography of his own life. He planned to combine it with the rest of the diary, and even wrote some prefaces for it. Unfortunately, he died before he was able to finish the project.

How the Diary was Written

Pepys would write down events as they were happening. When he was too busy to write, he would record events in his mind. Whenever he had a chance, he would jot down those"
B1,"The History of Shoes In the past importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today but other materials such as silk plastic or cotton are also popular depending on what is in fashion. In the 18th and 19th century, heeled and padded shoes were in fashion among wealthy people, to keep themselves from sinking into the muddy streets of the large cities.

During this time, fashionable shoes were very uncomfortable. Most people wore flat, laced leather shoes. Shoes were also made for practicality. Shoe designs varied in style. The heel was originally created to help ease walking up hills and across sand. In England in the 1800s shoes often had wooden soles. This trend started in the Regency period and continued into the Victorian era. The most famous example is Queen Victoria herself who was renowned for her love of shoes and had many pairs of ornate, colourful shoes.

Shoes became a fashion item with the rise of couture fashion in the late 19th century. Designers started using shoes to show their design skills. Christian Dior introduced ankle strap shoes and Christian Louboutin made coloured and red-soled shoes fashionable. Modern shoe styles have been heavily influenced by designers and celebrities, who use their choice of footwear to make an impact. Shoes are now made from a wide range of materials, including cloth, wood, glass and metal.

The 21st century has seen more casual shoe designs, many of which use elements from sports and utility shoes. The sneaker, or trainer"
B1,"The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the ‘famous Ghan’ which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known above all for being late. The train left Darwin on time, but the tracks further north were being repaired and it had to switch to a different route. The new route made the Ghan stop 25 times, and it travelled 3,500 kilometres (2,200 miles) in 55 hours and 44 minutes; 15½ hours longer than scheduled. It also travelled 275 hours slowly, which is one reason why the Ghan is never on time. It is a shame, because the Ghan was one of the first of what would become many tourist trains in Australia and it certainly has an atmosphere all of its own. The food is excellent and the staff are professional and friendly. It is simply too bad that the schedule is so unpredictable. (See the end of the blog for more on Mark's journey by train.)

When I was preparing to write my book, Journeys by Train, a number of people suggested that I write about the Ghan train. I decided to decline, because as far as I could see it was simply a train between two cities. However, what makes the Ghan stand out is how difficult it is to get to those cities. In fact, if you want to travel the world and you arrive in Darwin with the idea of taking a train to Adelaide, you will find a serious problem. Even when the schedule is on time, the Ghan will not get you to"
B1,"Henry Ford Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863 but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen he began work as a mechanic and in 1893 he built his first car. After he had driven it 1500 kilometres he sold it and built two bigger cars. He continued building cars until he started the Ford Motor Company.

The assembly line
Henry Ford built the Ford motor company into one of the most successful companies in America. One of the most important reasons he was so successful was that he used the assembly line to make cars faster, easier and cheaper to make. The assembly line is a way of making things faster by moving the thing that is being made along a line of people or machines that do one thing over and over again. Ford wanted to use the assembly line to make cars so he could sell them to ordinary people as well as rich people.

The Model T The Model T was the first car to be made with the assembly line. It was a small car that could be driven by anyone and could be used on rough roads. It cost 850 pounds to buy and you could use it to carry eight people 6,400 kilometres. It was very strong and could be used in any sort of weather.

The Model T had the same parts as other cars but it cost only half as much. It was a success all over the world. By 1927 the company had made 15 million Model T cars. But after 1927 Ford stopped making the Model T to make other types of cars.

A man called Henry Ford thought up the assembly line. It was a way of making things faster by moving the thing that was being made along a line"
B1,"Atlantic College Last week I went to visit Atlantic College an excellent private college in Wales. Unusually it gives young people much needed experience of life outside the classroom as well as the opportunity to study for their exams. The students who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world spend the morning studying. In the afternoon they have a range of activities to try out. One activity I had a go at was kayaking on a river. This was very good fun although I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to control the boat! Another activity was a walk in the woods where we had to find out about the wildlife. I really enjoyed this. My group found a bird and an antelope! There was also a trip to a farm and a chance to try out rock climbing, all in all a very exciting day. The college also allows the students to take part in volunteering activities. Some of the students went to Uganda to help out in a school there. What a fantastic trip! Atlantic College is a very unique college, and if you fancy a fun adventure with plenty of learning then it could be the place for you! A great experience, 10 out of 10! I would recommend it to any student out there who wants an amazing experience. I don’t think there is anywhere else that provides young people with the chance to have so much fun, learn so much and at the same time make so many friends from different countries. You also get the chance to be immersed in the language of your choice, so if you want to learn French or German, this is the place to be! (If you want to learn Spanish, you will have to go to Spain!) So if you want a great adventure in beautiful surroundings then Atlantic"
B1,"No Title A month ago I had no idea that on a Saturday afternoon in November I'd be hanging 30 metres above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me and realised why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. We'd driven for 30 minutes and were greeted with a huge building that took up a whole area of the park. In the middle of it was a climbing wall. The next morning was an early start. We met our instructor, called James, who had a very good attitude and made us feel welcomed. His personality was very good and the class was very informative. Then we started climbing. The instructions were simple enough but there was more than what met the eye. At first I found it challenging. But once I got the technique right, I realised how much fun it was. We had about three hours of climbing before our lunch break. And by this time, our arms had become strong. After eating, we had another three hours of climbing, which I had become very good at. And there were all sorts of challenges to try out. I didn't finish everything but I was happy that I tried. I got to the top of the hardest one! The next two days continued the same way. Each day, we climbed harder things, pushed ourselves to the limit and enjoyed it. At the end, I felt very happy with my climbing skills. We all had a fun time and will definitely do it again. Activity Centre, you rocked!

B1,"Letter to the Newport Evening News On Saturday afternoon I left my handbag on the bus. In it were my cheque book address book and my purse which contained about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realised what I had done it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old I was a long way from home and I was quite worried. But a kind lady on the bus, seeing me looking so lost, came up to me and asked if I was all right. I told her about my handbag, and she offered to take me to the Police Station and help me report the loss, even though she was going in the opposite direction. I was really touched by her kindness.

On 21 January a 60 year old man called Michael was in a pub in Llanelli, Wales, and he had a stroke. He was found by fellow drinkers and they called an ambulance which took him to hospital. There he had a second stroke. Michael had never been in hospital before, so he didn't know what to expect. He felt lonely and afraid. But then two policemen, who were also visiting the hospital that day, came into his room. They said hello to him and spoke to him, and made him laugh and feel more at ease. He was so grateful to them for making his stay at the hospital more enjoyable.

So, even though the world has many problems, there are still kind and caring people around us.

B1,"Shopping for furniture A report by Dave Worthington Homestyle a new furniture shop was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers including a leather sofa on sale for £45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). Homestyle says it will reopen its doors on Friday night, 2 am. The people who are angry about the time when the store opens have been reassured that there will be better offers and the store would be open from 10 am in the future. (49 words) This report by Dave Worthington, who works at the British Broadcasting Corporation, says that the British furniture store Homestyle has had to close shortly after it opened because so many people rushed to the store. The shop plans to reopen at 2 a.m. on Friday, and will offer more special prices and longer hours in the future. The story has been adapted from a real BBC report that appeared on the web site in March 2001. We have altered the date in order to make it easier to use.

Task:
Complete the following sentences. Write as much or as little as you like.

1. People who are angry about the store opening at midnight are reassured that there will be better offers in the future. (Yes, I agree.) I think they should be reassured about the timing too. It doesn't seem like good business practice to open a store at such an inconvenient time. People have to go to work in the morning, so a more reasonable opening time would be better.

B1,"The Eden Project Since it opened the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK’s most popular tourist attractions. At first sight the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is.

Inside these glass domes visitors can see plants from all around the world – some of them very rare. Some of the climate zones include the Mediterranean, Humid tropics and Desert. It takes a lot of work to keep these climates just right, with engineers working night and day to manage and maintain the environment.

In the central dome, which is open to the sky, people can learn about Eden’s education and community projects, the science behind the climate zones, and what each of us can do to help.

In addition to the indoor climate zones, there’s a huge outdoor garden – known as the Eden Garden – and 20 acres of biomes to explore.  This project is not only for tourists, it’s an education center where the people of Cornwall are the real ambassadors for the project.

The Eden Project is a valuable place for all of us to discover how everything that lives on Earth is connected to one another and how human activity is affecting the planet. It’s also a fun day out for all ages.

In Eden, the whole world comes together in one place. The people of the world have a chance to learn, get inspired, understand, change, take action and share. It is a place to explore our individual and shared responsibility to the world and to future generations. In this way, Eden has become a world-class educational resource"
B1,"NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH AN OPEN UNIVERSITY DEGREE Like any other university the Open University can give you a degree. However you don't have to stop working to study. It can also open up a whole variety of interests. If you have never studied before you will enjoy the special new pleasure of increasing your knowledge. You will get a huge amount of support from your tutors to make sure you do well in exams. The fact that you study through the medium of television, video, computer and Internet and don't have to spend so much time going to lectures, gives you the opportunity to gain more free time. This free time can be very helpful in doing some other work. Open University degree has a lot of flexibility. One can study at his own pace, at a time of his choice. This does not only make it easier for working people to study, but also for people like housewives and students who don't have the time and freedom to devote for full-time studies. It is true that Open University can not give you a degree as quickly as a regular university. You will take years to get your degree in most cases, but that doesn't matter. As it is called as distance learning, you can take as long as you wish. A good point is that you don't have to worry about getting a part-time job. Most of us worry about jobs when we don't have enough money or when we are on a holiday. The Open University can solve this problem. You will get a job quickly in some cases, and in others you will get support to continue your studies. So the Open University degree has opened up a lot of opportunities for people of different backgrounds. It is particularly useful to working people because it can help them increase"
B1,"JAZZ By Katie Atkins aged 14 I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools – and our band won! Each band had their own costumes ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly-coloured T-shirts. Our competition also included a dance band and a jazz choir. Although we didn’t have any special songs like the bands in the competition, we had a great time because the music we played came from our hearts.

Winner: Our high school jazz band won the competition for the first time. One of the judges was a professional jazz musician.

Mixed: The mix of costumes for each band was interesting. We had black school uniforms like mine, bright orange and yellow, and casual dress-downs.

Band: Each band was unique. There was a jazz dance band and a jazz choir.

Emotion: It felt great that we won! It felt even better that we played our music from the heart.

Imagination: I imagine that jazz can be hard to master. But, if you listen to the words you’ll see how much heart can be in jazz music. Jazz is more than just a hobby. It’s an art that brings joy to people.

Making music: Jazz can give you lots of feelings. Whether you’re playing a trumpet, singing, dancing or writing lyrics, jazz is made for everyone.

Playing music: Jazz is a language that you don’t even need to understand to enjoy, so long as you know that music is a language. So, don’t be surprised if you see a jazz band performing somewhere. Jazz is a"

B1,"San Francisco San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it was discovered by land rather than by sea. There is a popular saying, “The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco,”. It means that San Francisco weather is often foggy and cool, even in summer.

The city was officially founded on June 29, 1776. However, its first name was not “San Francisco. The original name was Yerba Buena, which means “good herb” in Spanish. But when the new U.S. governor came to take possession of the city in 1847, he renamed it “San Francisco. He did it because the previous name was too short and sounded Spanish.

Today San Francisco has more than 10 million tourists every year. A lot of people visit the Golden Gate Bridge, which is one of the most famous and beautiful bridges in the world. It is very important for San Francisco because it helps people travel across the bay and makes the city easier to reach.

San Francisco is also famous for its hills and cable cars. There are 50 hills in the city, the highest is called Twin Peaks.

The city is famous for its beautiful parks like Golden Gate Park and the Presidio. They are visited by more than 23 million people every year. They help people relax and enjoy the beauty of the city. Golden Gate Park is bigger than Central Park in New York.

B1,"STAMP COLLECTING - IT’S A HOBBY THAT CAN GROW AND GROW Millions of people of all ages enjoy a hobby which is both interesting and fun. And every year more and more people start a stamp collection of their own and discover an interest which can last a lifetime. Starting your collection is easy because stamps are everywhere. They are on letters and packages arriving at your home, and in stores and offices. The question you need to answer is: “What type of collection do I want to build?” That will determine what stamps you pick up, where you look for them, and how much you will pay. A collection of stamps is called a philately and there are many different types: 

1. Classical Stamps: The first step for most stamp collectors. These are the stamps that you see on envelopes, and they usually have pictures or designs of national heroes or events. Collectors are especially interested in stamps issued between 1840 (when the first adhesive stamps were used) and 1940.

2. Postal History: This focuses on the study of stamps and mail from a particular area, such as a city, country, or colony. It includes letters, postcards, postal stationery, covers, and labels.

3. Postal Stationery: This involves items such as postal cards, envelopes, and stationery that is already paid for.

4. Modern Stamps: This involves stamps that have been produced since 1940. This area of collection is very popular because there is always something new to find, and stamp issues are often tied to historical events, famous people, and other subjects.

B1,"New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role 'I never expected to spend some of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I’d only ever acted at school but I'd loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her. So when I saw a post on Facebook saying casting was underway for the series, I sent them a link to a recording of my school play. They got in touch and I had my first audition. The rest is history!

The Finnegans, was my first big acting role, but it has been a huge experience for me. It’s so lovely to work with such a tight-knit cast, especially since I was new to the industry. There have been lots of highs – having my family, friends and fellow students turn up for my first scenes was an amazing feeling. However, there have also been a few lows, such as working on Christmas Day, as we were filming. One particular moment I will remember was when I had to swim in freezing cold water, with no water-wings, for the final scene in episode one. I’ve learnt so much from the entire experience. It’s hard work, but I’ve loved every minute.

Working with my fellow cast members has been so much fun. There is always so much laughter on set. Jules Roberts is the most lovely, talented and funny person I’ve ever met and I am so lucky to have her as a friend. I think we all get on really well, and the fact that we have all become like a second family means that working together has been such an amazing experience.

B1,"Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car recycling wine bottles not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out. I want to be clear about one thing right from the start - it wasn't my idea to become the BBC's ethical man. I got drafted in. But I'll admit it - I do feel privileged. I like to think I'm pretty ethical. I recycle as much as I can. I don't fly first class. I buy fair trade chocolate. I live in an energy efficient house. But when I started this series, I realized I didn't really know that much about ethics. This was a big challenge - to find out what works when it comes to changing people's behaviour. And as we shall see, it's not easy. So what's this series about?

There are seven programmes in the series and you can find them all in this section of our website. I've also put together a series of Ethical Man's Top 10s - the best and worst of the ethically dubious world we live in. They cover everything from the environment to fair trade, from animal rights to the world of work. I hope you enjoy the series and I'd welcome your feedback - my email address is [email protected]

It's important we all think about how we live, what we buy and how we spend our time. So welcome to the BBC Ethical Man and I hope you have as much fun exploring our consumer world as I'm having making the series. And if you're new to the subject, I hope I can convince you to give it a go.

B1,"We went to the park. We knew of fifty-two sons in prison. We made a circle of lights one for each son. People stopped to look at the dancing lights and came to ask about our campaign. By the time it was dark our camp had grown to more than fifty women. They were all in tears.

Today we were in the park again. We put on white dresses and gathered in a circle. A little boy asked if we were angels and if his father was in prison. I said ‘yes’ to his question as we sang and prayed for all the sons in prison. 

Then we went home. My sister told me that the government had asked her not to do ‘anything’. They told her, ‘You may not go to the park, you may not go to the schools.’ But she said ‘this is our right, we will not be silent. If they take away one right, we will take ten rights.’ My heart is filled with hope and fear. We will not stop praying until our sons are free.” 1

The mothers of Nigerian Boko Haram prisoners stand up against the evil that has invaded their lives. Despite their fear, they choose hope and peace, and are unstoppable in their quest for justice.

In the world today, many have suffered evil, many have been violated, and many have been oppressed. Like the mothers in the story above, our choice must always be hope and peace. Let us follow their example and rise in unity against evil.

This month we have a special prayer request for all mothers and families suffering from the consequences of terrorism. May they find the courage to stand up against evil and believe in"

B1,"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod which means 'far distant place'. In 1925 a serious diphtheria epidemic broke out in Nome, Alaska. A life-saving serum was in Anchorage but it was a thousand miles (1600 km) away! The quickest way to get it to Nome was by dog sled. A team of 20 mushers and around 150 sled dogs started at 4 am on January 27, 1925. The teams of mushers travelled across rivers and mountains. It was a very difficult and dangerous journey through the Alaskan wilderness. After 5 days 5 hours and 16 minutes they reached Nome at 8 am on February 2, 1925. All of Nome cheered as the serum arrived. 30 years later, in 1953, the first Iditarod sled dog race took place. It started from Anchorage and ended in Nome following the same dangerous trail as the 1925 serum run. Thirteen teams and 65 sled dogs set off in the very first race. Today, the Iditarod is an annual dog sled race held every year in early March over nearly 1,100 miles (1,770 km). A race like no other, it has attracted adventurers and dog sled drivers from around the world.

B1,"No Title When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976 my only object was to earn enough to feed my children. Today 'The Body Shop' is an international company rapidly growing all around the world. In the years since we began I have learned a lot.

When I opened the first Body Shop shop in 1976, it was a cold winter day. I did not even have any money for a sign. I put up a cardboard placard that read ""Body Shop"" with a picture of the human body. I thought if I built a shop that would inspire, people would want to come and buy.

Today, the Body Shop operates more than 1,800 stores in 52 countries. We are one of the fastest-growing chains in the world. I am proud of that, but the real prize is the reputation that has helped us reach such growth. We have earned a worldwide name for our concern for people and the environment.

During the years, a few people have given up their jobs in body shops, which are small shops that repair automobile bodies, to join me. Their concern and skill have contributed to the growth and success of the Body Shop.

I believe in encouraging my workers to do their own thing, their own way. So, I never impose my thoughts and decisions on anyone. In fact, it is this freedom and openness that has helped make the Body Shop a unique company.

I think of the body shop as a kind of laboratory where we can experiment and learn. So far, we have learned many valuable things.

I think a business can do good and make money at the same time. If a"
B1,"Rock Band Two years agoour 14-year-old s onBen asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At firstwe were very much against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time' Ben argued ’and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end we gave in. Since then we have invested a substantial amount of money in his musical career. However, Ben has put the time in as well, with at least three hours a day of practice on weekends. He really loves it, and we have to admit we have come to love it too. The drums and the other musical instruments have brought a lot of fun and enjoyment into our home and have inspired our other two sons, who are also interested in music. It has also helped them learn discipline and persistence.

'What a great way to keep children occupied and out of trouble,' says Ben's father.

Today, our whole family loves music. We even have regular family jam sessions on Saturdays. Ben is getting serious about playing the drums and is considering taking lessons. We also bought him a keyboard so that he could learn to play the other instruments as well. And we are always encouraging him to improve his musical talents. We feel proud of him and are very satisfied with our decision to invest in his interest in music. It has definitely been worth it.

B1,"Free-diving in the Caribbean Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving the sport in which competitors reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air. In 2003 Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath and come back up to the top without help. For Tanya, a dive that reaches a depth of 100 meters is just the start.

Tanya's free-diving quest is all about testing herself and discovering limits that she might not ever have thought possible. Tanya's record dives are a testament to a spirit of adventure and perseverance. The discipline required to accomplish dives in the realm of 100 meters and beyond requires an almost preternatural ability to control the mind, body, and spirit.

To maintain control of these elements, Tanya uses a combination of meditation and exercise. The sport of free-diving demands both mental and physical strength. Tanya has to train and build her own lungs and body to get as much oxygen as possible, so that she can dive deeper and stay under water longer. To improve her strength and flexibility, Tanya also focuses on swimming and yoga.

Athletes like Tanya Streeter show that the limits of human possibility are much further away than most people think, and demonstrate that if you are determined to succeed, you can do amazing things, even when they seem impossible. What else can we learn about Tanya Streeter? Tanya Streeter is a British-American former competitive freediver. She is a World Champion, former record holder and currently a world-renowned freediving instructor. She is also a professional model, author, motivational speaker, and environmentalist.

B1,"ZOOS People began to keep animals in zoos over 3000 years ago when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally.

However, zoos have also been used for other purposes. For a long time, animals were kept in zoos so that they could be killed for food, sport or scientific research. Even though this is not the case any more, some people today still think zoos are bad for animals. They say that zoos cause them too much stress.

Although this may be true, zoos play an important role in our world today. Zoos help to protect many animals that would be extinct if it were not for the efforts of the zoo keepers and the donations from the public. Many zoos, have breeding programs to increase the number of certain species so that they do not become extinct in the wild.

In addition, many zoos play an important role in educating the public. They teach children and adults about the importance of the natural world and the need to protect it for future generations.

Another function of zoos is to provide a place to carry out important research. For example, a zoo may be studying the behavior of a particular species, how it lives in its natural habitat, what it eats, or how it communicates with others of the same species. Many zoos are also working hard to increase the number of animal species that are kept and how the animals live and survive in captivity.

Zoos also play an important role in preserving and providing animals for scientific research"
B1,"MONEY What is money? The pound the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book a huge bag of sweets or a couple of cinema tickets. Money has this kind of value by agreement. This means that money is something that the people of a country agree will be used to buy and sell goods and services. A bit of gold or silver used to be used as money, but it is now only used for decoration. Money is really nothing more than a symbol or a label that allows us to keep track of what we have and to keep track of what we buy and sell. Money has not always been used as a way of measuring the worth of goods and services. Many people trade goods and services directly with each other. They might even exchange a chicken for a dress, without any money being used. This is called a barter exchange. It takes much less time for both parties if a pound, a dollar or a franc can be used to agree a value for the goods. Money, however, is no longer the only way that people can exchange goods and services. Some people agree to use a kind of credit system. They use a kind of credit card that allows them to buy something without having the money at that time, as they may pay later. A bit of computerised information can now be used as a kind of money. But that is another story. 1. Does money have a value in itself or by agreement? 2. What is money used for? 3. Why have some goods and services stopped being bartered for? 4. What are the two types of money mentioned? 5."

It’s an amazing place as the builders have used wood for the whole thing just like in our old school but it’s also one of the first in my country designed to be really environmentally friendly. It’s also quite big and spread over two floors. We also have some brand new classrooms as well as a brand new canteen where we can eat our food instead of the portacabin we used to use! We are not going to have an official opening for a little while but we had a trial run with a special assembly in a room that hasn’t been finished yet! I am in a new class but all my friends are in my class too so I won’t be alone which is really good! I have also got a new teacher, who’s actually quite funny and not too strict which is a really good thing! We will have a proper open day in June when you can all come and see how nice it is! If you would like to come please let me know!
I am looking forward to being in this new building and finding out all about the different places and how to get there! I do hope you like it and I’m sure you will enjoy coming to visit!
Lots of love

P.S. I will write some more once I get my internet set up so I can show you lots of photos, and even make a video of the school opening, of course without my friends and I in it (but we will be on the stage!) as I think you would really like to see what a lovely building it is and what a lovely community we have and how much fun we have"
B1,"The Skywalk The Grand Canyon in the United States was created by the River Colorado. People visit the Grand Canyon Park to go walking and running but mainly to look at the view. It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 metres. The skywalk is 36.49m high from the Grand Canyon floor. If it was 1 cm high, it would measure 364.9 cm, or 364,900,000 cm in the whole. The Skywalk is made of glass and is 720 sq m in area. The glass used in the skywalk is 10 cm thick and it is 3.4cm thicker than the ordinary glass windows. The glass is made in Europe.

Glass can be used for many things, including: windows, mirrors, bottles, and even some cars. Glass has been around for over 5000 years and in that time, there have been many amazing advancements, like the type of glass that makes up the skywalk. Glass can be made from different materials and in different ways. The glass used for the Skywalk is made from silica, soda, and limestone.

The process begins with a mixture of sand, soda, and lime. Heat is used to melt these materials together, and as they become one, they become glass. At the right temperature, this mixture will become a liquid that has a high viscosity, meaning it's thick. To begin making the glass, a mould is heated and then covered in a layer of powdered glass. Then, the liquid glass is poured onto the powder."
B1,"Watering the Desert  It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh Morocco. It doesn’t happen frequently and when it does the city’s water pipes can’t manage the sudden floods which turn the streets into rivers. But as many winters have remained dry in recent times when the rain does come it is welcomed by the local people.  

I was standing in a side-street by a small fruit stand with my wife on a rainy morning during the wintertime when the shopkeeper explained how the water that comes from the sky fills up the streets and makes them rivers is much needed to feed the palm trees and olive plants that grow in the surrounding countryside.  

Water scarcity has been a critical issue in the region for centuries. It is part of the reason why many people continue to have a hard time growing anything besides date palms which are incredibly water efficient. The trees store water in their bulbous dates and when the date is consumed the water is released again into the body.  

In contrast to many crops that need to be irrigated, Date palms require very little water.  

In ancient times many people believed that the palm tree was a gift from God, an answer to their prayers for sustenance in the desert. The fruit was a source of nutrition and the fronds and trunks were used for shelter and clothing.  

Today the date palm industry continues to grow. In fact, according to a recent World Bank report, global production of dates has increased by 4.6% per year between 2010 and 2016. The increase is attributed to technological advancements in agriculture and the demand from countries such as Saudi Arabia"

B1,"Little Chefs For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. The school is looking to expand and develop a programme for younger children, as it believes in developing culinary skills in early childhood. The school also believes that good food can keep the peace at home. The school believes that by teaching children about the origins and flavors of food, and in some cases even how to grow it, they will appreciate it more.

The school aims to teach children to shop, to select quality foods, to develop the skill of food preparation, to manage portion control and the importance of eating fresh, whole and local foods. The school also aims to introduce children to the different world of ingredients. The classes are designed to encourage children to enjoy food and develop a healthy relationship with food. The classes are an excellent opportunity to learn about food from experts in a fun and relaxed environment. The school believes that if children know how to prepare good, simple, fresh, and healthy food, they will make healthier food choices in the long run.

To improve the food education of the younger generation, the school wants to set up special lessons that will encourage the younger children to learn in a fun and exciting way. It is important for children to understand how food is grown and where it comes from. The school believes in developing culinary skills at an early age, since cooking is one of the most important skills that can be taught to children. In the long run, it will lead to healthier eating habits. It is vital that the younger generation learn to prepare"
B1,"HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It consists of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. It is used as a food sweetener, in cooking and in medicine.

Honey is made by honeybees through a process where they collect nectar from flowers and store it in their honey stomachs, then pass the nectar to the house bees, who dehydrate it and store it in honeycomb, the cells in which they live.

Honey is used in food to sweeten it and also to make some drinks, medicine and other products. Because it never gets spoiled, it can be stored for a long time. In some places in Africa, honey is used instead of water in cooking.

Woman in market selling honey Honey can be produced throughout the year, but the yield varies with seasons. In the early spring, the honeybees do not find enough flowers to collect nectar. But as summer and autumn come, there are enough flowers and the bees collect nectar.

Honey is also used in medicine and in beauty treatments. The Egyptians used honey in their mummification process and the ancient Greeks used it to dress their wounds and to treat eye infections.

Wild Flowers. In summer and autumn, honeybees collect nectar from a variety of wild flowers, including thyme, heather, rosebay, foxglove, clovers and willow herb.

B1,"No Title Some people have complained about this year's collection New Writing 3 although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is pretty amazing? Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain.

New Writing 3: Faber Finds [Faber and Faber, 2004]

I was delighted to see how many young, new authors are starting to make a name for themselves, and how many new authors of ethnic origin are represented. It's not only a reflection of our society in all its diversity, it's also an exciting indication of how our world is changing.

The collection also contains some poetry and creative non-fiction. I'm not a great fan of poetry in general but found the poems in this book to be very accessible and easy to read. There is also a great mixture of voices - from the political rants of Zoe Williams to the quiet wisdom of the anonymous 'Cassandra's Daughter'. Some might find the final short story, by the late David Foster Wallace, rather dense and hard to follow.

I found it a little overpowering in its length and complexity but I admired the depth and clarity of his writing. If you don't like it, it doesn't matter. There are plenty of other things to enjoy in this amazing and wonderful book.

I am sure that I will read many of the authors in the book more than once, and already look forward to the fourth in the series.

'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio then to press previews all before lunch. Then in the afternoon I attended a fashion shoot and a beauty shoot. All the women were so warm and friendly and it was so exciting to be involved in such a glamorous environment,' says Mandie Currie, a zoo keeper who spent a day in the offices of the magazine Marie Claire. 'I think my new role really showed a different side to what people might already know about me,' she continues.

It was a day that taught me what a fashion shoot is really like,' says Currie. 'I can honestly say that my favourite part of the day was working at the fashion shoot. It was brilliant. The clothes, the models, the make-up – it was like walking through a fashion magazine. I even had the chance to style my own outfit with the Marie Claire fashion team which was so much fun.'

Currie said the day in Marie Claire's office helped her see the work that goes into a magazine. 'It was amazing to see how everything works – all the different teams from fashion, beauty and news all working in harmony to create the final magazine,' she explains. 'And I realised how much thought and effort is put into each issue of the magazine to help inspire and empower women.'

The day of glamour also made Currie think more deeply about her own fashion choices. 'It was fantastic to see a different side of the fashion industry. The day really helped me to explore the way in which I dress"

B2,"Then his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships' lights shone. The moon in its first quarter hung over the hill to the west and the stars were clear and bright. Five minutes later Dr Kemp pulled down the window again and returned to his writing desk.

A lot can happen in five minutes. I found myself wondering what might have been happening on the ships out there.

It's like a tease, really, as we know so little about those ships. They might be full of sailors sleeping off a hard day's work, or prisoners sentenced to work on those ships indefinitely, or they might even be ships full of ghosts that appear one night for no good reason. There are endless possibilities. And that's before you even consider what happens on shore.

This excerpt is just a snippet, but it's enough to set a scene and leave the imagination free to wander. That's one of the reasons I love reading. I'll spend a long time with my head in a book because it can transport me to different places and times, let me see the world through different eyes, and offer countless possibilities.

B2,"We are being bombarded with advertisements all the time and a lot of them are targeted at young people. Smaller children apart from spending their own pocket money can also influence what their parents buy so many TV ads are created with kids in mind. For example adverts for drinks feature cartoon animals.

One of the main problems young people have with advertisements is that they are not always honest and the things that are shown in them can look very different from reality. For instance, many cosmetic advertisements seem to show models who have perfect skin but actually their skin is often airbrushed to look better. Many people don't understand this.

Another issue is that a lot of the advertisements are targeted at young people and they often make the products seem better than they really are. In addition, they sometimes encourage unhealthy practices or habits, like drinking fizzy drinks or eating too much fast food. They also pressure people into buying products they don't really need just because they are advertised by celebrities or idols.

On the other hand, people who make the ads are very creative and sometimes they are very helpful. For example, ads can raise awareness about something important such as environmental issues or raising money for a good cause. Sometimes they can also introduce us to new products and brands and help us to make good choices.

It is very important for parents and teachers to explain to children and young people how to understand and judge adverts. We need to help them understand that most advertisements try to make things look better than they really are and this is how they try to sell their products.

Overall, although there are many negative aspects to advertising, with the right guidance young people can learn how to recogn"
B2,"No Title Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place that often worked. Failing that, you had to be persistent. Sometimes it’s a matter of luck, but you need to be able to recognise an opportunity when you find one. When the signs were displayed by an estate agent in Temple Bar, I went to check them out. I saw a large two-bedroom flat on Rutland Street for eight hundred and fifty euro per month. Although the flat was located next to the railway line, which created a cacophony of racket, I knew that it was a bargain price for that area. However, I couldn’t see myself enduring that noise for the long run, so I didn’t go for it. After weeks of searching in vain, I finally saw the ad in the newspaper for a flat on Leeson Street. It was a studio apartment priced at a thousand euros per month. After examining the size of the studio and comparing it to other places, I knew that it was a decent deal.

When I contacted the landlord, he told me that the rent for the place was eight hundred and fifty euro. So, it was even better than I had thought. However, I needed to act quickly, since he had other people interested in the flat.

B2,"Interview Tips First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress our eye contact our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words. People may even form impressions from just our clothes and the way we smell! So the way we dress and groom are important as are the first words we say about ourselves. First impressions aren't always right but they set the tone for the rest of the interview. Preparing for the interview will increase the likelihood of your success.

1. Plan to get to the interview at least 10-15 minutes ahead of the scheduled time. You don't want to be late for the interview.
2. Take a few moments before the interview to take deep breaths and quiet your mind. A short walk in the fresh air or practicing mindfulness or meditation will help calm your nerves.
3. Make eye contact with the interviewer when you first meet. A strong handshake will send a powerful message that you are confident and self-assured.
4. The first words you say will set the tone for the rest of the interview. Begin by saying, ""It's nice to meet you."" and then quickly share something interesting about yourself. For example: ""I enjoyed reading the company's newsletter. I noticed that the company has won several awards for its excellence in customer service.""

People looked at them and wondered if this event was connected in any way with the paragraph in the morning's paper. Was there some sort of conspiracy? ""Marguerite must be here somewhere,"" Raoul said, ""let us go and look for her."" With his arm around Raoul's shoulder, Count Philippe hurried through the house. They passed the footlights, then the front of the stage, and finally reached the orchestra, which ceased playing for them. In the wings they sought the manager, but he was nowhere to be found. The dancer had vanished into thin air. At last they went to the director, who knew nothing of her disappearance. It had never been expected; she had never given the least hint of a desire to leave the theater or to run away. The more they searched, the more bewildered they became. She could not be in the dressing rooms, nor could she be in the wings of the theater, for she had been searched everywhere. Still there was one place in all the world where she had not been sought. ""Let's go and look for her in the wings,"" Raoul finally said as they walked down to the dressing rooms again. They asked each dancer whether she had seen her, but none had. The whole company was thoroughly frightened.

B2,"Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. The idea of a dolphin is a positive one. They have a happy, smiling face, are intelligent, social animals, fun-loving, inquisitive, playful, loyal, and they work as a team. All of these are characteristics that make them hugely popular with the public. People love them. They rush to look at them in seaside marinas, buy films and TV programmes about them, and enjoy dolphins. And rightly so. But are they safe? Dolphins are apex predators in the marine world, and if there was ever a reason for us to take a keen interest in them, surely it is this fact that they are at the top of the food chain, and the health of the oceans relies on the health of these apex predators. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDC) is concerned, and so it should be. According to WDC figures, more than 45,000 dolphins, porpoises and whales were hunted for food in 2017 - and, in most cases, the hunters ignored strict catch limits. It also estimates there have been at least 8,500 incidents of whale, dolphin and porpoise deaths in the past 15 years as a result of human activity, including commercial fishing, climate change and habitat destruction.

B2,"Over the past fifteen years my research has documented that for many online life and smartphone connections have got in the way of things that people feel are important. We're so busy communicating that we don't have time to think we don't have time to sit down and have a conversation. But what I think the pandemic has done is it has forced people to stop, take stock and in the process, to re-evaluate the way that we live our lives and the relationships that we value. We've had to have tough conversations and we've had to think about the people who matter to us. So, the impact of coronavirus might well be long term in nature and its effects on the way that we think and act could be considerable. It may lead to changes in how we manage our relationships with others.

Some of the potential changes are:

1. Appreciating the physical and the tangible: People have become more appreciative of the physical objects that we own. During the pandemic, we've been restricted in the things that we can buy and many of the items that people have purchased are things that we can see and touch. Things like books, pottery, crafts. The tactile nature of objects can make us feel more grounded.

2. Feeling the need to spend time with others and to share experiences with them: We're aware that we only have a finite amount of time with the people that we care about. The time that we've had with others during the pandemic has made us aware of the value of time that we spend together. The restrictions have helped us to put into focus what are the most important relationships and experiences that we share.

B2,"Hamlet was angry that she should give such a dear and respectful name as father to the murderer of his true father and he replied sharply 'Mother you have much offended my father.' The queen asked him if he had forgotten who he was speaking to. 'Oh!' replied Hamlet. 'I wish I could forget. I am bound to remember.' Hamlet's reaction shows he is not satisfied with Claudius' role as king and he is angry that his mother has given the man who killed his father such a respectful name.
Hamlet, the protagonist of Shakespeare's play, is a complex and conflicted character. He is the son of the recently deceased King Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. He is haunted by the ghost of his father, who demands revenge against Claudius, the man who murdered him and usurped the throne. Hamlet struggles with his own feelings of guilt, anger, and resentment, and is torn between his duty to avenge his father and his desire for justice and truth.

In this passage, Hamlet's anger is evident when he refers to Claudius as the murderer of his true father. He is upset that his mother has given Claudius the respectful name of 'father', and he chastises her for doing so. This demonstrates Hamlet's strong sense of loyalty and duty to his father and his unwillingness to accept the circumstances that have led to Claudius' position of power.

The queen's response to Hamlet's anger shows that she is also aware of the complexities of the situation, and she tries to remind him of his own identity and the fact that he should not be speaking to the king in such a disrespectful manner. Hamlet"

B2,"Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves. In On the Origin of Species published in 1859 Darwin described the process of natural selection. The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. Gradually, over many generations, these beneficial traits become more common in the population. The theory challenged the established religious belief that humans were specially created by God. Darwin was an English naturalist who became renowned not only for his theory of evolution but also his contributions in the area of plant and animal geography, climate, geology, animal behaviour, marine biology, entomology and psychology.

It's a large house by the sea not far from the village of Ardbeag. The first time we went there, it had been a miserable weather. Raining constantly and the wind was so strong it could have blown the house down. It didn't stop us though, we just sat around inside and told stories, drank and laughed. But the next year we got very lucky. The weather was glorious. So, we decided that year onwards, we would always book the house for the first two weeks of June. I loved Ireland and every year couldn't wait for our holiday. By the second week of May, we would have the suitcases out and start packing for the two week trip. When it came around we would always have an amazing time. It wasn't just the great weather that we loved, it was the place itself. The house itself was lovely and warm and the gardens out back were beautiful. In the evenings we would have a BBQ on the lawn and the housekeeper would come around to light the chiminea. The housekeeper, Mary, was an old lady, but she knew how to party. She could drink as much as any of us and still be up to dance the jig with us, even at our age. We would always have a great time with Mary. I can't remember one holiday there that wasn't amazing. She always made the effort to have things prepared for us, she even remembered our favourite foods from years past and made sure she had them on hand for our arrival. The"

But now it was not the world's only network of computers. After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful other networks began to appear. The first other network of computers was a small one in England called ALOHAnet. It connected the University of Hawaii with the mainland United States. This network helped to open the way for the future because the ARPAnet had proved that computer networks could work and ALOHAnet had proved that they could work over long distances. The Internet was growing quickly after the creation of ALOHAnet. Another important network was a Canadian called CANet (Canadian Network). The CANet connected the Canadian government computer centers and universities. Soon the Internet began to grow beyond the United States. This was when the ARPAnet merged with a European network called CE (European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations) which was the precursor of what would become the Internet. The United States Defense Department provided seed money for CE and they helped the network grow. They believed that it would help to connect military computers. After it merged with CE, ARPAnet became a truly global network. Soon after the ARPAnet merged with the CE network there were also other networks such as CYCLADES. This network began in France and connected computers at the University of Lyon with computers in Paris. CYCLADES played an important role in building the Internet. It used a technology called Ethernet.

'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. At 15 he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in his home town of Manchester, and at seventeen he became a full-time regular in the RAF. At 19 he was too tall to fly, so he became a radar operator, then a meteorological observer, finally taking up a post as a physical training instructor. Now, at twenty-two, he has a wife and two children, and is five centimetres away from joining the ranks of the very few who are officially seven foot tall. At twenty-seven he'll have to ask for a change of name... but Chris is a happy man - happy he can help the army in this way. He wants to fly but is told that his height makes him 'the worst type of flyer' - but he isn't too disheartened. So, what next? 'It's hard to explain just what I am, and where I belong.' Chris’s own life journey is an example of ‘not fitting in’ wherever he goes. Yet with his positive outlook, Chris believes that he can make a difference and is dedicated to helping the army in any way he can. In addition to his RAF career, he's trained as a sprinter and was part of the relay team that won the English Junior Championships in 1993.

My son Gary was given his chance with cooking and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity I rushed over to look at the place. Gary had been talking to me about this for years. He had always shown a keen interest in food and when he was much younger would come to work in the restaurant with me. We used to make our own mayonnaise and he would ask me the most ridiculous questions which sounded serious at the time: ""What's a tomato?"" and ""What's egg?"" I thought it was so cute.

Now he was ready to take the opportunity and turn his hobby into a career. It was a chance that many young chefs are given, to run a restaurant with a great deal of freedom. This was perfect for him. I believed in his dream, so I sold my restaurant to someone else and left the country for several years. I went to Thailand, my home country, and worked there for three years. I have been in the restaurant industry for thirty years, so it was a big decision for me to leave but it was the right thing to do. I knew I could trust my son to run the restaurant and take it to the next level. Gary and his team at the restaurant have worked hard and produced some excellent results.

As a parent, I feel it was right to step back and let Gary take charge. I believe in his ability and he has proved me right so far. But it's not a question of being a parent and having your child fulfilling your dreams. It has to be a mutual thing. If Gary wants to"

My working day: The life of a chalet girl

6.00am Wake up with a cup of coffee, eat a bowl of cereal and catch up with the news and weather on my laptop. I check for any messages from my family and friends.

7.00am Make the beds and sweep the rooms. The guests often don't leave until late at night, so they like everything to be neat and tidy.

8.30am Head to the nearest supermarket with other chalet staff to pick up supplies for the week. I stock up on bread, cheese and salad, and prepare a shopping list for the chef to use in the kitchen.

10.00am Help the chef prepare breakfast. We serve full English breakfast, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages, as well as cereals, porridge, juice, freshly ground coffee and tea. I usually take charge of cooking the poached eggs.

B2,"In 1998 the world-class Moroccan athlete Hicham El Guerrouj broke the 1500-metres world record with a time of three minutes twenty-six seconds. Nearly fifteen years later nobody has beaten that time. Have we got to the human speed limit? Dr Frances Ashcroft Professor of Physiology at Oxford University explains the limits of the human body during a race.

To run 1500 metres at such speed, a person needs explosive power, endurance and a well-conditioned body.

“To run fast, you have to generate a lot of energy. The way you do that is by using a lot of power from your muscles and from your heart. Muscles can only generate power if they’ve been warmed up – you have to have good blood flow, good oxygen supply. It’s all about the amount of energy you can generate, how quickly you can generate it and how well you can use it.

“Hicham El Guerrouj was a world-class athlete, very well trained, very powerful. He did everything right. He was also very good at what we call economy of movement. When you’re running at that sort of speed, every little bit of excess energy that you lose as heat or movement is something that you could have used to generate a better speed.

“The human body is remarkably adaptable but there are absolute physical limits. We haven’t seen anyone run faster than Hicham El Guerrouj for nearly 15 years, so I think it’s safe to say that we have reached the limits of what humans can do, in terms of generating power from the muscles and the heart.

“Running like that does put enormous pressure on the body’s cells and that can lead to damage."

B2,"An eye for detail Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. This can create problems but it provides a constant source of inspiration for the artist and the gardener. It’s what a garden is about. It’s about colour and texture and scent and flowers. It’s about the plants themselves and about the way they look with other plants. I think one of the key things about my paintings is the way the plants interact with each other. This gives them life. I think that this makes my paintings more exciting than those of some other flower painters. My garden and all the other places I visit to paint are full of wild flowers. These grow in all kinds of places. Some have been left to grow around the edges of gardens. Others have appeared in lawns. Some grow in waste ground, in hedgerows and woodland. Some have been growing for thousands of years. Some have appeared more recently as invasive plants. It’s a huge subject and I’m always learning more about it. But I think that this variety of wild flowers makes the places where they are found even more exciting. All the wild flowers and plants are good subjects for my paintings. My favourite flowers are tulips and poppies, but there are many other plants which I love. I always try to make sure I have some of these in my garden. I am always on the lookout for new and interesting plants to paint and I hope that these will be ones which are wild as well as ones which grow in gardens. Wildflow"

""Isn't it past ten?"" said Carla.

""No. Ten pm. No local news since the trial ended.""

Carla's eyes opened wide, she turned on Jake, who laughed out loud at her wide eyes. Carla had never watched the news, so she was shocked by the trial.

More usually great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page.

#### Use of English – IELTS Reading Passage

The issue of privacy is an important issue that has come up for discussion in many social and cultural arenas. The author of this passage is concerned with how British tabloid newspapers are causing a breach of privacy. The privacy of individuals, be it public or private, has been invaded by tabloid newspapers through the use of photographs. This problem has occurred when these newspapers have published pictures of people in their private moments and spaces. This issue is brought into light by the use of real examples. The examples of celebrities being papped, which is when they are photographed by journalists without their permission, are used as evidence to demonstrate this privacy breach.

The passage also mentions how tabloid newspapers have a code of practice, but this code is being broken continually by publishing these images. Even though there might be situations where celebrities pose for paparazzi, the author points out that these cases are not typical. Instead, most celebrities are captured in their most private moments without consent, causing them great distress and leading to breaches in their privacy.

From the information above, discuss the following:

It would have been his grandfather's school as well, if he had lived. His grandfather Oscar had died in 1932.

So Paul started getting ready for Eton.

Uncle Oscar wasn't very much in the house. He went to a place called Kokkola in Finland, where he had some houses that were probably falling down.

Uncle Oscar went to see them and to have a look at them but when he arrived, there was a fire on the site. It took a long time to stop it. The fire brigade was very busy and all the fire fighters were very brave. Uncle Oscar didn't stay long in Finland.

Paul and his mother went to visit Uncle Oscar in Kokkola. It was a very long journey but when they arrived, they were happy to see the sea. They stayed in a hotel, which had a room with a huge wardrobe. It must have been a very old one because the mirror on the doors was old, too.

There was a very long road down to the sea and they liked walking down there. They could watch the ships go past and it was very cold and very beautiful.

When they went back home, Paul had a terrible cold and a terrible cough. He had a temperature and he had to stay in bed for days and days.

When I met her she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. ""We often train in supermarket car parks because it's the only place we can get hold of a court,"" Kendra explained. ""We also make the most of the weather and any opportunities we can get to play and practice matches outside."" It doesn't sound like the high-octane life of a leading sportswoman. But Kendra's achievements on the netball court are no less impressive than those of many other women in sport. In 1998 she won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, where her team beat Australia in the final. And in 1999 she was appointed captain for the 2000 World Championships in New Zealand. Despite these successes, Kendra admits that in her home town of Manchester she isn't as well known as many other local athletes.

B2,"ICE SKATING Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill.

Ice skates, of course, have come a long way since the days when they were made of bone and used in Scandinavia. Now we have metal skates, which have metal blades and boots.

Some of the modern-day sports in which players use skates include:

– Figure Skating: This is the sport in which people do fancy moves on ice. They spin around, jump into the air, and do amazing tricks. This is also the sport in which people dance to music while wearing skates.

– Speed Skating: This is the sport in which people race on ice. Skaters use a special type of skate that has no brakes, so they must start quickly and stay moving as fast as possible to win.

– Ice Hockey: Players wear metal skates and use sticks to try to hit a puck into the other team’s goal. They try to avoid being hit by the puck or knocked over by other players.

The history of ice skating is rich and diverse. It began in the Stone Age, with the first skates made of animal bone. Modern skating has come a long way from those days, but it still offers the same thrill of gliding across the ice that it did thousands of years ago. Skating, whether figure or speed skating, is a skill that can bring joy and physical challenge for a lifetime. Ice hockey is also"

When I met her she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park.

When it comes to making a difference, women in sport have a very powerful role to play. They inspire girls to take part in sport and they also have a strong influence on young women’s behaviour. Kendra Slawinski, England’s netball captain, has a huge amount of experience in this field. Kendra is a role model for young players, and an inspiration for girls across the country to take up sport. But, like many role models, it's her own personal journey that can teach us most about what makes her tick.

I played for a local team while I was at school. We won the local schools' championship in my final year of high school. After that, I was selected for a training camp and that's how I got to know more about the England squad. I was captain of the team that won the 2003 World Student Games in Japan.

B2,"In the weeks before the end of the tax year everyone in the firm was especially busy. With no wife to go home to Mitch worked later than anyone else. Besides he had extra work to do. One night at three in the morning he unlocked Avery's office on the fourth floor with one of the keys Abby had given him. On the desk inside he found a bottle of expensive whisky. In one of the drawers he found something more interesting—a bundle of banknotes, and in another a list of phone numbers.

But Abby was still in bed. He couldn't call her.

Mitch tiptoed back through the offices and into the lift. When he had reached the ground floor and was walking through the lobby he realized he should have taken the time to wash and shave. He looked a mess.

And Abby would not like what he had just done.

He looked at the list of phone numbers and decided to call a number at random.

It was her mother.

Mitch was arrested for stalking and harassment.

If he had used his head he could have made a success of a life on his own terms without having to go to prison.

What can we learn from this story?

1. Never call a woman at three in the morning. She might be sleeping.
2. Never try to act as if you were someone else; especially if that person is married to the woman whose phone number you called at three in the morning.
3. If you have to wash and shave do it before you call a woman at three in the morning.
4. If you are going to break into an office and steal expensive whisky and cash make sure the woman you are going"
B2,"Film Critic Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing - novels for other newspapers films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio.

The job at The Front Page was a good stepping stone. I learned how to write regularly for a newspaper. I became a better critic. The editor and my fellow journalists encouraged me. I was able to get to the early screening of the latest big movies at the cinema. After years of being a struggling freelance, it was like a golden age.

The job paid fairly well for a start, but in time, after a couple of years, it dried up. I left the job and the newspaper. By then I was married with two children and needed to get a more steady income. I've never looked back since.

I learned an enormous amount about movies and the film industry in those ten years at The Front Page. They've given me a great platform from which to write and think. I have gone on to write books and academic papers and to teach at a university.

But for the first couple of years, just after leaving school and university, those ten years, working on The Front Page, were very important. It was the time when I discovered what I was really good at. It was the first time I had to find my own voice and develop my style and opinions, rather than just writing like my professors at university.

Writing as a full-time job and getting paid to do what I loved, it was like living the dream. That experience at The Front Page was a major part of the path"
B2,"Favourite places Bruce I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me not empty deserts. When I was eight I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. In Lastingham, there was a ruined medieval abbey, built by a monk who used to sit there in a hollow tree. I never forgot the sight. So when I went to India for the first time with my family, I was delighted to find the ruins of a monastery on the top of a hill, with another monastery and a holy forest below. It was lovely to walk among the old trees and read inscriptions in the stone. There's a lot of history there, a lot of sadness and a lot of suffering. I could feel it. I would love to visit again and again, and write about it in my diary. But I couldn't stay there forever because I miss my family. I love them a lot. There are many other places in the world which attract me. When my friend suggested that we should go together to China, I was delighted. I was excited to see a landscape which is completely different from the one I saw in India. In China, too, there were ruins, monuments, but the trees and flowers were different. I liked it because there I could see life among ruins and I could get a sense of eternity. I like these special landscapes which are not completely untamed but have traces of mankind on them, even if they are ruins.

If they did they wouldn't write such rubbish.' 'Yes I know' said his wife. 'Archie do listen. A murder is announced and will take place on Friday October 29th at Little Paddocks at 6.30 p.m. That's in this house here, and that's you. Just look at the way it's described. ""The Reverend Colonel Easterbrook will be found murdered in the library with a lead pipe beside him, his face horribly distorted by the effort of dying agony."" How horrid is that!' 'No, no, no!' said the Colonel, 'I'm not being murdered, you may depend on it.' Mrs Easterbrook laughed. 'I'm sure you're not,' she said. 'But don't you think it's awfully amusing?' 'Amusing?' said the Colonel. 'It might be amusing to some. But I don't know why a newspaper should think it amusing to announce a murder beforehand.' 'I don't know why either,' said Mrs Easterbrook. 'I suppose they are doing it to sell their paper.' 'Ah well, let's see what happens,' said the Colonel. 'I must say I've never come across such a thing before. It ought not to be allowed. Still I dare say it's just a publicity stunt.' The play A Murder is Announced is a crime novel in three acts written by Agatha Christie.

B2,"Careers Advice You're not happy in your job at the moment but you don't know how to change? Kitty Doherty gives some good advice. The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser. You will be asked to write a brief history of yourself and then sit through a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. These are used by careers advisers to help you identify your preferences and strengths. However, you should realise that you may have to pay for the experience, even if you are not yet in paid employment, and that the results may not be as good as you had hoped for. 'Once you have got your results,' says career consultant Carol Sparke, 'you can use them as a stepping stone to a new job. But you need to be realistic about what they will tell you and then see how you can use the insights. This involves a lot of hard work.' One adviser tells the story of a girl who wanted to become a vet but had done poorly in chemistry at school. The psychometric test revealed that she liked working with animals but had to confront a reality in which, at the age of 22, she realised she wasn't going to become a vet. She is now working in a pet shop. It is important to make sure you choose a reputable adviser. There are over 15,000 people in the UK giving advice, but only a few hundred are members of the professional body, the Association of Careers Advisers. You can find a list of these on the association's website (www.acas.org.uk). In general, the more reputable advisers tend to charge more for their services. The cost, according to the Association of Careers Advisers' website, ranges from £25"
B2,"IN HOT WATER Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.

Rachel is fascinated by the different layers of water in the sea that have been there for thousands of years. ‘At the base of the Atlantic Ocean is water that hasn’t changed for at least a hundred and fifty years. We have discovered clues to what happened in the past through measuring the isotopic and chemical composition of these deep-water layers.’

Rachel’s research has taken her to the South Atlantic. She spent three months on board the RRS James Clark Ross which is a research ship. ‘Being at sea for three months was an incredible experience. I was in awe of the beauty of the ocean and the wildlife we encountered.’

There is an amazing variety of sea creatures in the ocean such as squids, whales, and dolphins. Rachel and her colleagues also saw sharks. ‘While they are scary-looking creatures, they are quite placid and are no bother as long as you don’t provoke them. I hope I can go on more research trips because I just love the ocean.’

Rachel spends a lot of time under the ocean surface in a submersible – a small submarine. ‘The submersible can take me down to 3,000 metres in the ocean. That’s so deep that the pressure on my body can be as much as a tonne per square centimetre!’

Rachel’s research is important"
B2,"Kowloon Walled City had no wall around it. Standing apart from the neighbouring buildings it rose to fourteen floors-buildings with more buildings piled on top. Legally it belonged to the People's Republic of China a part of the colony that was never British. In fact neither Chinese nor British law had effect there. In the eyes of the law it did not exist. 

With a population of about 50,000-55,000 people squeezed into less than a sixth of a square mile, Kowloon Walled City was perhaps the world's most crowded place. The buildings seemed to grow spontaneously. Without plan or permission the structure expanded around an open space filled with garbage, debris and sewage-a place where children played. 

Kowloon Walled City became an iconic symbol of urban blight and a byword for urban sprawl. Its shanty-like buildings, narrow alleys, lack of light, space, facilities, and hygiene became a symbol of the woes of mega-cities around the world. The Hong Kong government was keen to demolish it and replace it with housing for 30,000 families. In 1993, the 22-acre area was razed to the ground.

This fascinating little book is a unique source of information on this bizarre structure. It is written by architects and city planners and explores the architectural and urban history of Kowloon Walled City. 

The authors have used extensive research and a great number of drawings, photographs, maps and historical documents to reconstruct the architectural history of the city. They provide a detailed analysis of the urban"
B2,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE When you first enter the Model Village it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground flat and completely overgrown with brambles. For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land. What a contrast this now is – a quaint model village, complete with cottages, village hall, church, pub, and a wide variety of well-stocked gardens.

In 1976 a group of enthusiastic members of the South Essex Potters Club, under the supervision of their President, the late Mr Albert T. Brind, embarked on their venture.

Hundreds of hours have gone into constructing this small village, all the materials being recycled from elsewhere.

We can only wonder if the founders ever dreamt that their village would grow and prosper so much that 33 years later, it still continues to attract so many visitors from all parts of the world. The village has become something of a tourist attraction and it is not just a day out, it is something that can be enjoyed for hours.

Please come and visit us, we are sure you will be just as captivated by this unique, and truly remarkable Model Village as are the many thousands who have visited us in the past.

The Model Village is open daily from 10am. The village is closed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, and from the beginning of October each year.

Please telephone before visiting if you require an escort or guide due to a disability.

B2,"Variations on a Theme If you're thinking of taking children to a theme park there are dozens to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to test the best. Fun Island - The Burns family Last year we went to a huge theme park in the US and we thought that Fun Island might seem dull by comparison. But we had a great time. It's smaller, but there are no queues, and the staff are very friendly. As it was winter we didn't have to queue for the indoor rollercoaster. My 10-year-old son is a bit of a rollercoaster fanatic and he particularly enjoyed the Sky Flyers, which give you the sensation of flying. They cost an extra £3 per ride, but as the children said afterwards, you just have to do them. There are plenty of rides that will suit children as young as three, though there are not many for teenagers. The food is very expensive, but there are plenty of places to sit down, and I liked the fact that you didn't have to spend money to get into the park. 

Splash World - The Wilkinson family I can see why they call Splash World a theme park, because there are rides, rollercoasters, a huge water park and a zoo. My 12-year-old daughter is a bit of a water baby, so she loved the whole thing, but there's so much to do here that I could easily spend the whole day there. We were worried about the water park being cold but the temperature was just right for splashing around in the lagoon. If you fancy getting wet, there are rides like the Rapid River Run, where you sit"
B2,"Where I get my energy Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the full to tell us how they do it. A. Jeanette Kupfermann Journalist and author: 'I think it's excitement. I've got to be doing something that's a challenge. If I'm absorbing something new and learning I get tremendous energy. The things I love doing most are interviewing people in their last years of life because they often have such incredible stories and I've learnt a lot from them. I also love writing books because it's such a different process from journalism. It means that you have the time to think more and to research much more than you do in the press. I get excited about new things and I think it's an interesting thing about me that I've never met a book I didn't like. I love to read as well as write.' B. Deborah Bull Dancer: 'My energy comes from being passionate about what I'm doing. I'm not at all good at being bored. I don't like sitting around doing nothing. I find being on stage performing absolutely fantastic. I also get energy from my love of ballet and the fact that it keeps me fit. It's something that I love so much I'd continue it even if I didn't perform on stage, because I find it to be an incredible, exciting way to exercise. It's not a chore; it's something I really enjoy and that keeps me going through my busy schedule. I love the life I've got and I don't want to waste a minute of it so I just keep going and going. I don't get tired.' C. Helen Keller Deaf and blind American writer and lecturer: 'I"
B2,"Confident people what's their secret? Confident people may look as though they were born that way but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it. A Jenny When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. But I worked in a hotel and realised that if I was going to get the job done I'd need to be more outgoing. I read a book on assertiveness and realised that other people weren't that great either – I just had to pretend I was.

Alice Trying not to be so shy was a struggle for me. I found it difficult to talk to people and I was afraid of being rejected, so I decided to tackle the problem head-on.

I started going to clubs and trying to have conversations with people and just get over my fears. This took me about two years, but when I could hold a conversation it felt great.

Rose I've always been confident. I'm an extrovert, so I talk to everyone and anyone. However, I found it hard to say no, and I'd say yes to everything asked of me.

I soon found it was ruining my work/life balance, so I realised I needed to become more selective about what I commit to.

Sally One of my mentors told me that I looked really confident. The strange thing was I didn't think I was.

I asked him to tell me how I came across that way and he gave me some really helpful tips: stand up straight and always make eye contact.

I thought I would try these and see if they would make me feel more confident.

B2,"Trills and bills If there's one thing guaranteed to send tears running down your cheeks it's the sight of a brilliant child collecting a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young stars and their mothers to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. A. Annika Reeder 15 won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. The most amazing experience was the opening ceremony of the Games. All the athletes were lined up in order of discipline and I was at the front of the group. I wasn't expecting to be in the first line and when I got to the front, I almost had a heart attack. It was surreal.

B. Myleene Klass 13 won a silver medal for playing the clarinet in the European Youth Music Festival. I can only play in front of people I'm comfortable with. In front of an audience of 2,000 and the press watching me, I was terrified. Afterwards I felt a massive sense of relief but my body was completely exhausted.

C. Katherine Timms 14 won a gold medal for gymnastics at the English Schools' Athletics Championship. Before I competed, I was so nervous. Once I started, I found it easier. What I find hard is keeping up with school, work and training. I'm always tired and have to do a lot of work after school or at the weekends.

D. Julia .... You have had a lot of experiences since the age of 15. Tell me about some of your favourite moments. Annika When I was 15, I went to Belgium with my school to do some gymnastics. We stayed in a nice hotel where there was a swimming pool and spa. I liked the competition"

B2,"The kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and riversfeeding on fish. Old trees overhang the stream half shading shallow water. Soft greens mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze. A kingfisher sits low in the undercut bank and looks right into the camera at very close range. Then he flies across the water, disappearing over a ridge, a sharp and brilliant flash of blue.

A little kingfisher is seen near the water in the tree above and it dives deep into the water and disappears. A kingfisher then flies from a tree near water, low level, and flies in to perch on a low branch, with its long tail and beak, and stares at the camera.

A female kingfisher perches on a branch at a very close range. A kingfisher then flies from a tree near water, low level, and flies in to perch on a low branch, with its long tail and beak, and stares at the camera. One last kingfisher flies close across the water and disappears out of sight over a ridge.

Wildlife photographers will agree that the kingfisher is one of the most beautiful birds in the world. Its stunning blue and green plumage, combined with its brightly coloured bill, make it a joy to photograph. The wild and elusive nature of the kingfisher, along with its vibrant colours, make it an incredibly challenging and exciting bird to photograph. The kingfisher is a challenging bird to photograph, requiring a fast shutter speed and the correct focus.

B2,"Studio Audiences What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical difficultiesstudio audiences are just another common feature of television lifeand yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows for example we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? In this week's View we'll try to explain who they are and why they're there. I guess it could be quite easy to think that the studio audience are either just there to get a free ticket or just a mass of extra's for a live performance - but that's not true at all.

First of all they are there to create a kind of ambience. When we look at a game show or a quiz show, let's say, we see a group of very energetic people. And in a way, the excitement of the studio audience can feed into the enthusiasm of the game show host or the contestants. Without those studio audiences we wouldn't get a game show with quite the same energy. And I think for that reason, the audience is very important.

Another function that studio audiences fulfil is that of a live audience in a theatre - to let the performers or the actors know that what they're doing is being watched. So, for example, when we watch a sitcom or a comedy show, when you see the laughter of the audience it makes us feel good. And that laughter from the audience will then get the laugh out of us too.

I think the studio audiences also serve as an editorial function. They help the editors of a television programme know whether they're on the right track, in a way. So if they laugh a lot, then the producers will"
B2,"It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. At fifteen Chris was signed up to the navy, and at sixteen he joined up. But he was soon told by the navy he was too big to serve in the sea. 'The navy had a weight limit,' says Chris, 'but that was not a problem. I was too tall instead. It wasn’t just the height either. My feet were too big. Even my clothes were too big. The trousers kept falling down so I had to hold them up with my knees. I was told I couldn’t serve in the navy, but they kept me on as an extra pair of hands on board. I was a very useful person on a boat.' It wasn't just size that gave Chris the edge though. 'I was also the perfect cook. Everyone would want to be my mate because they knew they’d get good food. So I made a lot of friends, and had a lot of respect from the people on board.' What did Chris want to be when he was younger? 'I wanted to be a flagpole,' says Chris. 'But as I got taller, it seemed the people around me were getting smaller, and they said I had a future in acting.' And Chris, who is now six foot eleven inches tall, is happy with the way things turned out. 'Yes,' he says. 'I think I was right.’

B2,"In April 1919 the British rulers in India decided to put down protests in the city of Amritsar. As people gathered in the public garden during the festival of Vaisakhi a British general ordered his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd. As well as thousands of injuries there were hundreds of deaths. The massacre was the worst moment of repression during the British colonial period.

The event, known as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, led to many protests within the British Empire and throughout the world against British rule in India. In Britain itself there was outrage as the massacre was revealed by Indian newspapers as well as those in the UK. Demonstrators gathered outside the India Office demanding justice.

In response to these criticisms the British attempted to suppress the information reaching their home audience, using postal and telegraph censorship to curtail the spread of news about the event. Despite these measures, newspapers in the UK and around the world published reports and pictures of the massacre. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George called for an inquiry into the events of the massacre, but the colonial authorities in India responded with a whitewash report.

The event has been an ongoing source of tension between Britain and India to this day, particularly the refusal of the British government at the time to conduct an impartial inquiry into the events.

In 2013, the British Prime Minister David Cameron apologized for the massacre and for the British role in India’s partition, while India’s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the British had to answer for their actions.

That's because of the nature of the EN-V. Last week I drove one of these though it was more like flying a small plane than driving. The controls are a handheld joystick and you sit in a central cockpit with a windscreen all around, like a tiny jet fighter. It’s all very advanced. It’s electric, too, so totally silent but it also means that recharging takes about four hours and it has a range of about 100km. No petrol though it looks like a lot of future car design is heading this way. All in all a fascinating glimpse into the future of transport.

We'll be on the train, which is called the Allegra, and my daughter, who's eight, and I will have a croissant and a cup of tea, or sometimes we'll be there to see a train come in with lots of grapes, as there's a vineyard in the middle of the town.

Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear. In one chapter there is an analysis of how New York would survive if there were no humans to take care of it. In this video, you will be able to see how the city would change over time as weeds start to grow and take over. In time, it could look very different from what it looks like today. This video is a good example of how urbanization is changing landscapes, but also how the natural world is very persistent and can overcome human impacts.

Please watch the video and respond to the following questions:

1. What are the key points discussed in the video?
2. How might we compare human impact on cities to a plant growing in a field?

B2,"Living in the valley We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival. It was the year when the storms came early before the calendar even hinted at winter even before November was out. The air was biting cold as we bundled up in layers of sweaters and jackets and our hands were covered in thick gloves that allowed us to handle tools and weapons alike. I remember it was my turn to be on guard duty by the fire that was our only source of heat on the cold nights, and that day had not been much different. The fire was burning fiercely, its light flickering over the walls of the stone house we lived in. It was when a sudden gust of wind blew open the door that I noticed something unsettling. A figure was standing there, wrapped in thick layers of clothing, it was so dark and obscured that you could hardly make out its features at all. It was the stranger that stood there with a chilling presence.

The stranger’s arrival Although the stranger didn’t talk much, and neither did we, he came into our lives like a storm. A violent force that disrupted the calm and peaceful existence we had known for so long. The stranger had joined us in our valley to escape a world that had grown violent and cruel, and he had told us the tales of that world, and how he had left it behind. It was a world of destruction and suffering, a world where no man was his brother’s keeper, and where the weak were thrown to the dogs. It was a world where the powerful ruled, and the masses were nothing more than fodder for the battle"
B2,"Miss Rita Cohen a tiny pale-skinned girl who looked half the age of Seymour's daughter Marie but claimed to be some six years older came to his facto1y one day. She was dressed in overalls and ugly big shoes and a bush of wiry hair framed her pretty face. She was very young-looking and she spoke in a high pitched voice.

Miss Cohen said she was a young painter and wanted to study in America, in order to learn how to paint. She was very anxious to go but she said she hadn't any money and asked Seymour to give her some for her passage and for the first few months' expenses.

Seymour was touched, for he was always open-hearted to students, but he was doubtful too, for Miss Cohen looked very young, and she spoke in a somewhat childish way. He didn't like to refuse her however, so he promised to lend her the money if she could find her way to America and come back and tell him how it was done.

She went, and came back with a good story to tell. There she met Miss X, a famous painter of the village who used to work with the famous Signor X before she left the old country, and there Miss X promised to give her lessons if Seymour would give her some money to work on and for food. Seymour would not do it, and the girl never came back again.

This story was told by her brother, the painter Seymour himself. Miss X could not be traced since that day. In the old days a Miss X or Miss Rita would have been known as a ""sucker,"" or a ""jeweller,"" but"
B2,"Style Merchants Style informs every part of our lives today from clothes to interior decoration and accessories. Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion. Ned Ingham: Dress Designer Ned Ingham makes dreamy romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles' he explains. A very stylish idea of a wedding dress was featured in the film 'The Birds of Paradise' where Deborah Kerr wore a long flowing dress with long flowing sleeves. 'People also look at the past for inspiration. The dresses worn by the English Royalty have always been a fashion influence. I think that Princess Margaret had a style which was very beautiful.' He thinks that the important thing is to remember that 'The bride is the star of the show. She must have a gown that fits her and suits her. If it's not right, if it doesn't fit, the wearer might be the only person who thinks she looks good!''Fashion doesn't really have its own rules, it's all about having fun and experimenting with different styles, it is about putting things together in a way that suits you.'' Jo Foley's fashion tips for the new season are as follows: * Go for more colour and patterned fabrics if you want to make a statement * If you're going for a more classic look, stick to black and white * Experiment with new trends such as pastel colours and florals but make sure they fit your personality * Do the opposite of what everybody else is doing if you want to make a statement * Don't be afraid of making mistakes - they are part of fashion too. * Choose the colours that you feel most confident in, that suit your skin tone"
B2,"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour.

The solution may be to seek help and support from a Specialist Music School. These schools are specifically tailored to meet the special needs and abilities of those with a high level of musical aptitude and, in many cases, a similar ability to learn other complex skills as well.

These schools have talented and experienced teachers who can nurture your child's potential, who will recognise their skills and develop them further.

These schools provide a range of facilities and equipment that are crucial to assist a developing musician and help them excel, with everything from music practice studios and concert halls to music therapy facilities.

The focus is on the child’s potential, and schools aim to create the best possible learning environment that stimulates growth and creativity. With small classes and lots of individual attention, every child is encouraged to discover their strengths and make the most of their talent.

B2,"A NEW LIFE The Farmer Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm. 'After 14 years in business I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. It just didn't seem like the right place to live and work any more. I realised that the only person who could change things was me. It was a great decision to take up a new profession. I wake up every morning with a smile on my face because I love the life and I love my work. The only challenge now is to find the time for everything. Life was always busy before but now I have so much more going on.'

Matt Froggatt is a man with a plan.

In December 2012, the now 48-year-old left his job as a director at the Royal Liver Assurance insurance firm in the City of London to move back to his family home in Devon.

But before you start looking at your piggy bank and wondering how you can buy a chunk of land to set up home, know this: Mr Froggatt is an experienced agricultural worker and has managed to combine his passion for animal welfare and farming with his business know-how.

It wasn't as easy as it sounds.

""Farming is a massive business and it is a difficult business to get into if you are not already in it,"" he explains.

""Firstly, the banks are not lending money to new entrants and the level of risk is very high, particularly if you are not farming something that people are accustomed to. But after a year of"

C1,"We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.

We found four people who wanted to make a swap:

- Jan is a stay-at-home mum and she loves her three children, but she longs for a more exciting life and perhaps for a way to earn her living.
- Emma is a business journalist and loves her job, but sometimes finds it hard to get the work-life balance right. She has a desire to do something more creative.
- Alex is a teacher, and he knows that he wants to do something different and maybe get away from the classroom. He enjoys talking with people, but his current job doesn’t give him much time for it.
- David is a hairdresser. Although he has a lot of customers, he’d like to try something else. His dream job is to be a musician, especially a guitar player.

For a day, they all switched jobs. Jan became a business journalist, Emma had a go at being a stay-at-home mum, Alex tried teaching, and David experimented with being a hairdresser.

What happened?

We asked Jan how her day in the office with Emma went: “I loved it! I had great fun, but it was quite exhausting. I realised that my writing skills were more limited than I thought, and I was very pleased to be back in my own home with my children afterwards.”

Emma was equally impressed with her day as a"
C1,"Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country says Georgina Ferry but she is little known For the past four years I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. They nod knowingly and ask: 'Who's that, then?' I try to explain that she was a British scientist who won the Nobel prize in 1964 for her work on protein structures, and that her portrait was on the new £20 note. Invariably, I find they are totally blank. This seems odd, because Hodgkin, who was born in 1910 and died in 1994, was the first and only British woman to have won the Nobel prize in sciences and is therefore a landmark figure in the history of British science. She was also the only British scientist, male or female, to have won the Nobel prize twice. But Hodgkin's absence from the public's consciousness is the result of a broader problem: women's scientific achievements are far less known than their male counterparts' achievements.

C1,"Under Sarah's Spell Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. Here she is interviewed by Joanna Watt There cannot he many artists who l10 not sign their work unless they are asked to. Sarah Janson a trompe-l'oeil artist is one. She is a British artist who works primarily with oil and acrylic on canvas to create paintings which look remarkably like photographs. Her work has featured in major art fairs and she is a Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours member. Sarah says she became interested in trompe-l'oeil as she loved the idea of being able to make the viewer question what they are looking at. ""The paintings seem to exist in their own world - you can see them in a photograph, as if they're a painting in a painting,"" she says.

""I like the idea of deceiving the eye and causing a slight moment of confusion, where the viewer thinks that the painting is a photograph. Once I have established this, I try to find the most subtle ways of showing that it is actually a painting.""

Although trompe-l'oeil has been an art form for centuries, Janson likes to introduce a contemporary edge to her work, and she often incorporates digital manipulation techniques, making use of layering, blending and manipulating brush strokes. For this reason, her paintings are not only difficult to photograph but also to reproduce on the canvas. ""One of the biggest challenges I face when I'm creating the painting is figuring out the colour palette,"" Janson admits. ""I have to decide on the overall palette and then find a way to manipulate that colour palette"

C1,"A trumpet isn’t just for Christmas… It is strange how many musicians even leading ones come from homes without music. Out of the blue Hakan Hardenberger the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world’s trumpet-players today.

## Hakan Hardenberger

The young trumpet player with long blonde hair, blue eyes and a face that expresses warmth and honesty as much as his musical language is warm and honest. When he was six years old his parents decided that he should learn an instrument. The choice fell on the trumpet. Hakan took great pleasure in this decision and with the same self-confidence with which he can now fill large concert halls he played and played his trumpet.

The instrument he received as a gift from his parents was old, and a friend who played trumpet was unable to prevent Hakan from getting himself a small injury on his lips because of the poor quality of the mouthpiece. But the young musician didn’t allow that to stop him, quite the contrary. In many ways he has been a lonely player.

It was also the family who encouraged Hakan to choose his own path. There was absolutely no question of a professional career in music – it was out of the question. But they supported him and gave him the opportunity to express himself.

So a musician was created. During the last ten years, Hakan has given concerts in twenty countries. He has worked with many of the leading orchestras in the world, as well as working with musicians from different kinds of musical genres, like the British guitarist John Williams, the American pianist Emanuel Ax, and"

A. HENLOW GRANGE I welcomed the opportunity to go to Henlow Grange for six days as I was tired and needed to relax. It's about an hour away from London by car. Henlow Grange is the country home of former British Prime Minister, Hilton Young. There are 60 bedrooms, which all have beautiful views of the gardens. The spa treatments are very reasonably priced, and the food at the restaurant is healthy yet delicious. The health farm programmes offer a variety of treatments, from facials and massages to relaxation and stress management techniques. For me, the most enjoyable part was the outdoor heated swimming pool and the sauna, because it allowed me to unwind in the warm sun. It is a place you go to feel better.

Charles would not hear of troubling her. She insisted. It was a battle of kindness. He would not be swayed.

Emma was in a state of excitement, and could hardly believe her eyes. She saw his name clearly written, in the letter before her. She saw it at once. She could hardly read the words, and her heart stood still. To be able to call him Monsieur Knightley—

She went out on the lawn as soon as the door closed. Oh how she would like to talk to someone about it! If any one could have been within, it would have been running to her with excitement! The gardens, trees, and the whole place were at her command, and not a creature to say one word about it, to sympathize with her happiness. She would go and tell her mother. Yes, she would—

C1,"Sound the Alarm Stuart Harris reports Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Stuart Harris suggests that the key element is the quality of the sound – as it is to some extent for all audio gear, of course – and he takes a listen to what’s available…

The radio alarm clock has undergone a few changes of late, with most having changed from having a digital display to a radio/speaker design. The reasons are fairly obvious, with people wanting to make the most of digital radio reception while also being able to use the radio as an alarm clock. Here is a selection of some of the best digital radios available that double up as alarm clocks. All of these have DAB, FM, Bluetooth and an alarm clock with snooze and sleep functions as standard. We have tested the following digital radios:

I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn’t have any summers. When the rest of the country was basking in the sun, we were out in the field, my father and I, planting the 55,000 trees which turned the derelict Wicken Fen from an environment of weeds into one of beauty. That was in 1961 - the last summer I had was three years later, on the day my father died. From that point on, the sun seemed to desert me. It took me a long while to find the motivation to re-engage with nature on a personal level, but that experience with the trees and the sense of renewal we gave to the Wicken Fen project remain a turning point in my life. In many ways, they still are. I had always been interested in ecology, even as a small boy. But as a student at Cambridge in the early 1960s, it did seem a little wayward and unfashionable to be obsessed with trees and nature conservation at a time when the rest of the world was in the midst of an industrial revolution. The only place I found solace was when we were out in the field, the sun beating down and the earth, so alive and fertile in its abundance. We felt that by simply re-introducing trees, we were helping the land reassert itself. It was the first time I ever really saw how the environment and ecology were entwined, and it was a"

James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase as a headmistress of a girls' school. Born in Oxford, UK, in 1920, James grew up in the London suburb of Hampstead and trained as a nurse and social worker. She worked in the National Health Service before joining the police force - which is where she gathered the extensive knowledge about police procedure for her novels. 'Murder has become a professional endeavour,' said James, 'and I believe that for a crime writer, the greatest skill is a knowledge of human nature.' In this interview, best-selling novelist Barbara Michaels meets the acclaimed crime writer whose innocent exterior hides a complex and brilliant imagination. Barbara Michaels is the best-selling author of nineteen novels including ""The Murder of Mary M"", ""Death on Demand"", ""The House on the Strand"", ""The Tangled Web"", ""The Dark Angel"", and ""Victim of Necessity"".

Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‘open farm’ six years ago we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. We often have requests from people to come and live on our farm, with their pet animals. In most cases we know we’re not right for them, but for some reason we couldn’t say no to a lady called Melissa and her three young children. Their pet badgers had been taken away from them by the authorities and we thought a little rest and recreation wouldn’t go amiss for the poor creatures. I was slightly put out when one of the youngsters, James, asked me to build a shed for the badgers to live in. I’m used to dealing with sheep and cattle, not badgers, but I’m not a complete idiot. We have to look after them properly, otherwise we’d be in trouble. ‘Do you have any badger friends?’ I asked James as we stood by the shed James had built, trying to make conversation and feeling ever so slightly foolish. ‘I’ve got a couple,’ he answered. ‘In fact, I’m expecting one of them here any time now.’ ‘Who is it?’ I asked. ‘His name is Barney,’ James said. ‘Can you build a burrow for him?’ ‘I’m not sure I’ve got the right tools to do that,’ I said, trying to hide my lack of confidence.

A bad review, on the other hand, can stop some people in their tracks. Reviewers can, however, be an essential part of the launch strategy, and a publisher may decide to delay reviews until a few months after a book is published. Publisher B The value of reviews for individual books depends on the profile of the book - its genre, subject matter, reputation of author and publicity machine. The success of a book in terms of sales and reviews can have a feedback loop effect - good reviews sell books, which leads to more reviews, which sell more books, etc. Reviews can sometimes define the success of a book, or be the cause of it's failure, or lead to word of mouth selling (or not selling). Publisher C Reviewers can and do play a significant part in promoting a book, sometimes by writing an extremely positive review that is quoted on the book cover, sometimes in the way that a negative review can increase sales for a popular author. But there is no rule of thumb and the effect of reviews is unpredictable. Publisher D Reviews matter greatly when the book is by a known or important author. They can be very influential if the reviewer's comments fit with the author's profile. Good reviews are an important element in promoting and selling a book. Publisher E Reviews matter greatly"
C1,"WEATHERVANE MAKER THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham’s designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. In his own words, “I am constantly inspired by new designs and ideas.” The traditional weathervane is a finely balanced copper sphere that turns gently in the wind. The wind direction is shown by the position of the arrow. Graham’s weathervanes are designed to be robust and functional as well as decorative and aesthetically pleasing. Each of his weathervanes is handcrafted from a sheet of copper using a simple pair of tools - a pair of pliers and a blow torch. The basic form is created by following a line that is drawn around the copper sheet. The line forms the shape of the finished weathervane, which in turn follows the basic form. When the line is complete, Graham uses the pliers and blow torch to work the shape up. As the shape forms, the copper is heated until it starts to soften. It is then bent into place. This is a labour-intensive and time-consuming method. There is no machinery or assembly lines involved in the making of his weathervanes. The process begins with a design being drawn on paper. This design is then transferred onto the copper sheet. From there, it is a laborious process of following the drawn line by shaping the copper. Once the shape is complete, it is left to cool. The final stage of the process is painting. Graham uses various shades of paint to give the copper some relief. Once painted, the"
C1,"But he most regretted his denials that the industry aimed its advertising at teenagers. ""We spent millions studying kids. We knew that they could name the three most advertised brands of cigarettes. We knew that almost 90 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands. Why didn't the companies tell the world these facts? The answer is self-evident. The industry would be shamed.""

This denial of the industry's youthful target audience was a crucial point, because it made tobacco executives deny the connection between advertising and smoking by children.

""The industry was caught in the act of doing something that could not be justified, so it had to deny that it had done anything at all. The defense, in essence, amounted to this: 'The companies were not targeting children. We are innocent. We don't know how kids came to know our brands.' In the process, Philip Morris and the other major tobacco firms were claiming to be victims, not villains, and had they been telling the truth about their practices, they would have been forced to confront their culpability directly and to take responsibility for their actions."" (pg. 165)

If the industry was not targeting teenagers, why did they spend millions of dollars advertising to them?

""The industry spent millions of dollars in research, and almost nothing on adult smokers, because they were trying to capture future smokers, and future smokers were mostly children."" (pg. 166)

If advertising did not cause kids to smoke, why did the cigarette industry try so hard to advertise to them?

C1,"The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar one of Britain's top 10000-metre runners visits the Kenyans’ high-altitude training camp. Ten miles south of the equator a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. Nestled at the foot of the mountain, surrounded by towering pines and bamboo, is St. Patrick's high-altitude training camp. From the 2,400 metre camp, an asphalted tunnel winds its way up, up, to the summit of Africa's second highest mountain 5,199 metres above sea-level. For the past four seasons Richard has been spending two months a year at this 8,000 foot training camp.

I first learned about the camp from the world-facing magazine 'Runner's World' where it was described as a top-class training base for Olympic hopefuls. The camp is run by Fr. Colin Grant, a Roman Catholic priest from Newcastle. In 1994 he decided to set up the camp to help the Kenyan's, who because of their impoverished background, have little or no access to sports science, coaching or support. Fr Grant says that while at the camp athletes learn about the art and science of running but more importantly, they learn about the spiritual value of endurance. It is true that the spiritual dimension of their daily lives is a great asset for the athletes. I spoke to Kenyan Olympic bronze medalist Stephen Cherono and the world cross-country champion, Joseph Munyao Keter. Both men stressed how much they have benefitted from the spiritual and moral teachings at the camp"

This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. That was when Frank Westers, a Dutch boatbuilder, came up with the first of his wave-piercing catamarans, which he called Wave Piercers. They. were the first boats to. have shallow hulls, shaped to ride up over breaking waves so. that the deck. stays dry and stable throughout. I knew about the design when we were working on our first powerboat 20 years ago. We knew that it had something. to offer our craft, which is a fine. 16.5ft fishing boat with a central console, a. large cockpit and a 90hp outboard on a transom. The. Westerman, as she became known, was the boat of my dreams, a design that. combined 2,000 years of sailing traditions with the finest of modern materials and technology to. create a craft of great strength and flexibility. The boat was designed by. Jens Quistgaard, a Danish designer of international renown, and was built in Denmark by the skilled craftsmen of Borge Bjorn. It took four years, from 1985 to 1989.

C1,"Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards. Hedgehogs can be found in Europe and Asia, and in the southwestern United States and Mexico.

The word ""hedgehog"" is derived from the Old English hecghehogu, hoccehogu, meaning ""hedge pig."" The Latin term for ""hedgehog"" is erinaceus, and the name is sometimes applied to any of the 15 species of hedgehogs.

There are about 17 different species of hedgehogs in the world, ranging in size from about 5 to 30 inches long, and some hedgehogs even reach weights as heavy as 15 pounds. Some hedgehogs weigh as little as 8 ounces.

Hedgehogs are insectivores and mostly eat insects, but some will also eat small vertebrates such as frogs, mice, and birds. They will even eat berries and nuts. They are nocturnal creatures which means they are awake mostly during the night and sleep during the day.

Hedgehogs have a short, strong, snout and ears which are only slightly visible. Their eyes are small and dark and their vision is not as good as their sense of smell. They have sharp, curved claws which they use for digging burrows and foraging for food.

Hedgehogs are solitary creatures,"

Before the Industrial Revolution blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers because they were the sole providers of weapons armour and farming tools. This volume brings together 350 years of ironworking in one splendid collection of over 100 drawings, photographs, diagrams and documents. All the items are drawn from the remarkable Collection of Ironwork at the V&A Museum, which is unique in its scope and quality. It contains some of the earliest examples of iron casting as well as a vast array of work from the Middle Ages through to the modern day. Among the highlights are a 16th-century gun carriage that once served the might of Spain a remarkable manganese-steel mace from the 18th-century Indian subcontinent and an ironwork masterpiece of the 17th century. This superbly produced book will appeal to historians students of metallurgy and all those with an interest in ironwork.

C1,"The Tartan Museum The modern cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened. You cannot miss it. With its two zigzagged towers, the National Museum of Scotland dominates Chambers Street in the centre of Edinburgh. At the entrance, a cast-iron fence replicates a medieval city gate, and as you pass through you see the 19th century, sandstone-grey building with its decorative clock. The exterior is Victorian, but the contents of this building, which is part of the museum, are 350 million years old. On each side of the old-fashioned main doorway there are towers that bear the unmistakable marks of 19th-century architecture. The National Museum is on two levels, the upper one being the new 'Scotland for the 21st century' exhibition hall. The ground floor houses galleries of history, world cultures and science, all of them with an emphasis on Scotland and the way life has changed here over the past 500 years. The old building was designed by the well-known Scottish architect William Playfair (responsible for the facade of the National Gallery, London), and has been described as 'the masterpiece of mid-19th century Scots Baronial architecture'. After you have passed the clock you come to an exhibition area which is dominated by the centre-piece of the building - the massive, 19th century, Grand Staircase - an excellent example of Victorian design.

Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. But the man who predicted the comet's return every 75 or so years also left a lesser-known legacy. In 1700 he travelled up the east coast of Greenland to explore the variations in Earth's magnetic field that might have hindered navigators of the time. His journey had a tragic end. Halley's ship got stuck in pack ice and all but one of his crew died. His story has fascinated British geologist Dr Toby Clark for many years. This summer Clark and his team of researchers embarked on their own expedition to Greenland in order to unravel the mysteries of magnetic field variations along Halley's route. ""Sir Edmund Halley's expedition had been very much a voyage into the unknown,"" says Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh. ""He didn't know whether he would be eaten by polar bears or trapped in ice for the rest of his life."" The expedition was also perilous because magnetic field variations could spell disaster for the sailors. Magnetic compasses, which point to the Earth's magnetic North Pole, not true north, are affected by variations in the magnetic field. ""A variation of 10 degrees could mean you miss a port by 100 miles,"" says Clark. Using modern scientific equipment, Clark, 32, aims to determine just how great the variations in Earth's magnetic field"

My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I will take them in the order of my climbing them. A. Mt. Kilimanjaro, Africa - the roof of Africa. B. Aconcagua, South America - tallest peak outside the Himalayas. C. Mt. Carstenz Pyramid, Australasia - the only active, earthquake-prone continent on Earth. D. Elbrus, Europe - the highest peak of the Caucasus. E. Logan, Antarctica - located in the Transantarctic Mountains of Queen Maud Land. F. Everest, Asia - the highest mountain on Earth at 29,029 feet. G. McKinley (Denali) North America - the highest mountain in the North American continent at 20,320 feet. My first climb of the Seven Summits was Africa, Mt. Kilimanjaro. This is one of the most recognizable mountains in the world, and it is a dormant volcano. Its name, in the native Chagga language, means ""we cannot fail to notice it"", and it is hard to imagine a better name. Although only slightly higher than Mt. Whitney in California, the distance and climate challenges make it a daunting task for the unprepared. This mountain has three distinct areas: the cultivated lower slopes, the heath and moorland, and the summit. I have often thought of it as a walk in the park. My experience on Mt."
C1,"Photographing People People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations the photographer has to be conscious of actions gestures and expressions. This means you have to be sensitive, understanding and be able to interpret what you see in the moment and put in into a frame. I can show you different styles of people photography and the essential techniques to improve your photography of people.

Headshots:
Taking photographs of people head to toe is called portraiture. The most popular type of headshots include full body shots and close-ups. A headshot is a close-up of a person's head, often from shoulder to the top of the head, including just the face and sometimes part of the shoulders. In photography, headshot often refers to portraits or pictures of one's head. It is often used to represent people on business cards, profiles, or in publicity. A headshot is often used in acting, modeling, corporate and private photography. The purpose of a headshot is often to show a person’s character, personality and even their mood.

Fashion Photography
Fashion photography captures clothing and other fashion items and is a major form of commercial photography. It can be glamorous with lighting effects and moody, in black and white with dramatic and sophisticated designs, or natural and simple, with light colored clothing and summer looks. Fashion photography can portray a particular style or designer and is used for advertisements or fashion shows. Fashion photography often includes full body and full body shots of models.

C1,"The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her in action. One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. The caller is Sue Brown, the Hotel Inspector, and the visit is no routine stay; it is the annual audit of the hotel’s service.

For the Globe, it could be career-threatening. The hotel was the first I chose to see on my whistlestop tour of five hotels in two countries, and it is still early in the day. But already I can see that the inspector has her work cut out for her.

As I turn up the hill where the Globe sits, it is impossible to miss the sign by the gates. “The Globe Hotel – We aim to be the best!” it reads. The boast is big enough to warrant the sign’s prominent location, and one would have to assume that Sue Brown is about to arrive and check if the sign matches reality.

Sue Brown is a cheerful and likeable, if slightly bossy, New Zealand-born woman with glasses and a sense of humor. She’s been in the hotel business for over 30 years, and has worked in the industry from frontline to the executive suite. She’s in her mid-fifties, and clearly she enjoys what she does, and likes to have fun along the way. For the past seven years, she’s been on television in the UK, appearing regularly on Channel 5 as the Hotel Inspector.

C1,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support If you applied for a job in some countries you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting as much as anything else that would determine your suitability for the job. Forget all that mumbo-jumbo about aptitude tests and personality profiling. The truth is that you are much more likely to be assessed by some bloke with his nose buried in your scribblings, muttering away, than by some computerised multiple-choice exam machine. The same is true of job applications. In the UK, employers cannot officially discriminate on the grounds of your handwriting. The writing itself is just not considered reliable enough. But in some countries, notably Italy and Germany, it is not unheard of for employers to use handwriting as part of their selection process. That, at least, is the view of Dr Adrian Goffin, a British handwriting analyst of some twenty years standing. He believes that handwriting can tell us all sorts of things, including your personality, your character, and your health and happiness. To that end, he and his wife have run a series of handwriting workshops for senior managers in the UK. A typical workshop will last two days, and will include both theory and practice. Asked what managers hope to gain from the workshop, he points to a range of possible answers: an increased awareness of the importance of communications; an improved ability to spot dishonesty in others; a better understanding of themselves and why they behave in the way that they do. A typical case Dr Goffin cites is that of a senior manager from a large city-based charity, who"
C1,"Volunteer tourism Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. A. It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. However, volunteer tourism has grown in popularity, with many programs now being offered in developing countries, and many students are choosing it as a way to experience travel and get a different perspective on the world.

B. The problem lies in the definition of ""voluntourism"": Is it voluntary, or is it tourism? Some argue that it is a form of tourism that incorporates a voluntary component. Others contend that it is a form of volunteering that is somehow ""commercialized"". The debate continues to rage on without a clear definition being found. Volunteer tourism, by whatever definition, is an interesting way for students to combine their education with the experience of cultural immersion in the real world.

C. Some argue that the positive aspects of volunteer tourism outweigh the negative aspects. The positive aspects can include: the development of a new global perspective, increased understanding of different cultures, improved skills, and the potential to make a direct impact on local communities. This can make a huge difference in a student's education, opening their minds to new possibilities and challenges. The negative aspects might include: superficial contact with the local culture, the potential for exploitation, and a tendency to reinforce cultural stereotypes. These can also contribute to a student's education, albeit in ways that may be unintended.

D. Volunteer tourism can be seen as an educational program that benefits"
C1,"A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the most prominent pieces in the collection is a cast of the Discovery of the Hiding Achilles group of statues, from the Roman Baths in Bath, England. Other highlights of the collection include a cast of the Chatsworth Apollo and the Chatsworth Diana, as well as a large number of Roman sarcophagi, including that of the late Emperor Tiberius. There are also many beautiful fountain sculptures in the museum. The Museum of Classical Archaeology is located in South Kensington on Exhibition Road, but can be seen from the Street from the outside. Admission is free.

The museum also holds a large collection of natural history specimens, including skeletons of marine mammals, large African animals, and many birds."
C1,"Are you too nice for your own good? When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity. 'I'm so sorry' I beamed when I dropped the plate on the floor and it smashed into smithereens. 'My mistake, sir' I grinned when I served the wrong dish. 'Oops' I chuckled when I spilled a drink on the customer's lap.

But what's the cost of always being the 'nice' one? Of course it's a good quality to be nice, but being too nice means that you risk being seen as a pushover, which means that other people treat you like one.

So why do we go out of our way to always be nice to everyone? Why can't we be assertive and set boundaries, especially when we're dealing with annoying people?

I read a great article which says that being too nice can stop you from being able to say no to things or to make clear your own expectations. You are so used to putting other people first that you don't even think about what is best for you.

You can be too nice if you spend more time worrying about what others think about you than what you want. You are also too nice if you never get mad at other people, or you can't stand up for yourself in a disagreement. You're also too nice if you always try to make up excuses for people when they mistreat you.

I guess my point is to know yourself well enough to realize when you're being nice to cover up resentment, bitterness or anger and learn to express it constructively. In other"
C1,"Science flying in the face of gravity Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964 a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. But unlike the original model, which was designed to transport airliners across the Atlantic, this aircraft had been converted into a low-flying laboratory. In a previous generation of space travel and with an emphasis on hands-on experience, the craft would have been part of the American space programme. With two engines on each wing it was a marvel of engineering, and its conversion from a military to civilian role had created a unique environment for students to conduct experiments in weightlessness. Now, however, it was the final day of a course that had brought together international students from as far as Latin America, Europe and Asia. The students had been given the opportunity to design and build their own parabolic flights. These tests, which involved simulated periods of microgravity lasting for up to 27 seconds, required two or three minutes of air time to ascend and descend. This had given them time to conduct their research in weightlessness. Onboard the KC-135 were a variety of experiments conducted by students:

- Using a 3D printer to create objects in microgravity to learn about the optimal process of producing materials on the International Space Station.
- Developing a new and potentially revolutionary design of antenna to receive satellite signals.
- A group of students testing the effectiveness of their own medical devices in low gravity conditions.
- Students who are already in the workforce testing the effectiveness of their new designs in creating objects in micro"
C1,"The day I drew Picasso Richard Cork recalls how as an 78-year-old student he came face-to-face with one of the most revered artists of the century. Even seen at a distance eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an I8-year-old student filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. Picasso was clearly an eccentric character. The first part of this book is autobiographical with Cork reflecting on his early interest in art and how he came to meet Picasso. The second part deals with Picasso and his work in greater depth. Picasso had this inexhaustible appetite for creativity which never slackened, with each day throwing up an entirely new perspective on art and on his own work, Cork explains. He was a pioneer in his art and his methods, but Picasso also wanted to inspire others to be creative; for him art could bring happiness to the human soul. Richard Cork was born in London in 1933. He studied at the Courtauld Institute and worked as an art critic for the Guardian from 1963 to 1988.

The Art of Drawing Picasso by Richard Cork, a very experienced art critic, and a passionate art lover. This memoir, with its charming mix of autobiography and art criticism, paints an illuminating portrait of Picasso the man, and the revolutionary artist who forever transformed the world of painting. For more than forty years, Picasso was a constant in the art world and a great influence on several generations of artists. Picasso was the artist in whose world the boundaries of modernism were being re-drawn and redefined, Cork explains. Even as a young student, I felt that his"
C1,"Hit and miss of mass marketing AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertisers, with an understandable loyalty to the tried and true, were among the last to recognise that new technology was changing the way people shop and buy. Now advertisers are discovering how the advent of computers and electronic television, the proliferation of cable channels and the spread of interactive advertising is forcing them to come up with new and better ways to persuade consumers.

Telling stories

Marketing experts say the basic problem with advertising is that for 75 years it has been mainly about telling stories. TV advertising, the industry's favourite medium for over two decades, involves making stories with high production values so that the programme can fit seamlessly into the flow of broadcasts. It does not work. A study conducted for NBC and AT&T's cable networks found that although viewers are more receptive to advertising than ever before, 86% of ads go unnoticed.

“Unhappy truth”

The basic problem with advertising is that for 75 years it has been mainly about telling stories.

But it's not just bad timing or a clutter of ads that creates this problem, it's a whole new type of consumer. Nowadays consumers regard advertising with a jaundiced eye: 47% are suspicious of advertising claims. Consumers don't just distrust advertising. They often see it as irrelevant, a constant bombardment that's"
C1,"Plugging in the home Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. She recounts here how she was able to transform the family home into an efficient workplace.

It had been three years since I was at home with my children every day. Now that they were nearly 8 and 12, it was time to start freelancing again. And I needed a way to work that would let me be at home with them, while at the same time make the most of my home office.

My home office in my Georgian semi-detached house was a dismal, cold and gloomy, basement office with no outside light and a floor that had never been replaced. It was also a mess.

I started by making the office more of a pleasant and inspiring space to work in. To do this, I painted it with bright colours and put up inspiring posters and framed art on the walls.

I realised I needed some more storage for paperwork and office supplies. And I couldn't do my work without my trusty laptop and printer, so I bought a new desk that could accommodate them both. I also had to make the room more comfortable with an ergonomic chair, and an electric heater to keep it warm.

The internet connection needed to be much faster to accommodate video calls and conferences with editors and other people I work with.

I needed to be able to access files quickly so I bought a server that I can store all my files on. This means that the kids can’t access any of my files, even if they"
C1,"POWER DRESSING EVERY SUMMER the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance?

Darwin knew that the peacock's train is not merely a gift but a form of natural artistry - and an expensive one at that, as the bird's energy is sapped by a display that he himself described as a ""costly badge of nobility"".

What could nature have possibly achieved by such wasteful flamboyance? This ""elaborate ornamentation"" - with its 140 eye-spots, each one representing a tiny brain in the peahen's eye - is the product of nature's most enduring game of seduction and intrigue. As it turns out, the answer is hidden in the wings of an unlikely insect: a moth.

At night, with only the faintest moonlight, female Luna moths fly through the darkness to find a mate and reproduce. As it happens, the male Luna moth has evolved an extraordinary trick that allows him to recognise the female and avoid the many competing male moths.

In the darkness, the male Luna moth flutters its delicate, translucent wings, revealing not only a unique and unmistakable ""signature"" pattern of bright eye-spots, but also the glowing green light that the insect uses to find the opposite sex. This light - in the biological world a phenomenon called bioluminescence - guides the male moth"
C1,"NATURAL TALENTS In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees we haven’t had time to develop any differences: genetically we’re still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps. On this grand evolutionary scale whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. This means that if there’s a way for animals to do something really well, it would be safe to assume that we humans should be able to do it just as well. For example, every animal has the natural talent to move fast, jump high and catch things – humans have no greater innate ability than any other animal on the planet when it comes to these physical feats. Similarly, every human is a natural artist. We may not necessarily be as good as professional artists, but if we give it a try we should be able to produce some work that is artistic.

If everyone had the same natural ability for certain tasks, then in a world without competition there would be no reason for anyone to excel in them. However, there is a competition in life and that is why only some individuals will choose to try to maximise their skills, while others won’t bother to try. The fact that all of us were born with the same physical capabilities also explains why so many people spend their whole lives trying to convince themselves that genetics alone were responsible for an inability to excel in sport or the arts – and that they could have done better if only they were blessed with an extraordinary physical constitution or had more natural talent. This is an attempt to avoid accepting personal responsibility.

> Everyone has exactly the same natural ability – what separates the champions from the rest is the amount of effort that they put in. – Bill Bowerman

He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1969, while still serving in the Navy, he became the first man to sail solo, non-stop around the world, in the Golden Globe race. His two-month journey from Falmouth to Falmouth covered 30,000 miles. He has also raced in the Whitbread and BOC Challenge and is now an adventurer, writer and broadcaster.

1. What is the most thrilling/exhilarating experience you’ve ever had and why?
Chris Bonnington: I think it would be difficult to single out one particular thrilling experience. I guess it would be the two times I climbed Everest. First, in 1980, with Joe Tasker. It was a great achievement, but we were only the sixth and seventh to climb the mountain, so it was very remote and wild then. I scaled it again in 1985 as part of a five-man team which included Al Rouse and Doug Scott. I’m proud of that ascent. It was the greatest challenge, physically and mentally, I’ve ever undertaken and it meant a lot to be on a team with such great climbers. It gave us great satisfaction to reach the top.

They were moving slowly upwards at the rate of about one foot per minute. They had been climbing for five minutes and it was a hot day. 'The sun must be extremely hot here,' reflected Lenina as she fanned herself with a fold of her sun-umbrella, 'it is forty-nine degrees in the shade.'

It was the World State's policy to prevent its citizens from suffering any pains or undergoing any fatigues whatsoever, and here on a mountain side in the heart of Africa the effect of the policy was unmistakably seen. The four men and five women who were with Lenina were all in exceptionally high spirits, partly as a result of the suppression of any and every painful sensation, and partly as a result of the five grains of soma a day and a little promiscuous sex which they had all been enjoying in turn during the ascent.

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.

Chewing gum has been around for thousands of years, but the modern form that we’re familiar with now only came into existence in the late 19th century. The process was developed by Thomas Adams and it used chewable chicle from the sapodilla tree, which has been used as chewing gum by the indigenous people of Central America for centuries.

In 1871, Adams imported the first shipment of chicle from Mexico. By the early 1900s, Adams and a number of other entrepreneurs, like William Wrigley Jr., had established the mass production of chewing gum. Wrigley’s first gum, called Wrigley’s Juicy Fruit, introduced an aluminum foil wrapper and was one of the first gums to be marketed in packs rather than individual sticks.

The gum culture has since exploded. In the 1950s, Bazooka Bubblegum introduced comic books as an item in every pack and in 1997, Bazooka added a baseball card and trading advice to the packs. Bubblegum remained popular amongst children into the 1970s when bubblegum cards started to become more prominent.

In 1982 Evans 32 left a successful career behind in London and moved to the United States to chase the Hollywood dream. The years that followed however would see one dismal project after another. In 1986 a desperate Evans traveled to Britain to search for work. There in London he wrote a treatment for a 1930s Hollywood-style screenplay titled The Horse Whisperer. That treatment would eventually see the light of day in the form of a book published by Random House in September 1995.

This film has a real hardboiled edge that recalls the 1936 drama Captains Courageous with a dash of the tension of The Hunt for Red October.

A A Boyz N the Hood I wanted to hate this film when it came out but on rewatching it recently I felt it had a great deal going for it.

I think it is an intelligent and honest film that has aged remarkably well. Set in the impoverished South Central region of Los Angeles in the mids it tells of three young black men whose lives take different directions after being brought up in the same house and attending the same school.

It is a film of two halves. The first half sees Ice Cube and Cuba Gooding Jr. playing themselves and is essentially a series of domestic snapshots exploring the importance of self-respect.

The second part, set two years later, features Laurence Fishburne as a former neighbour who has made his money from street dealing and is now a major-league drug trafficker.

There is a danger that the old medium is dying before the new has truly emerged. The end is not yet in sight, not by a long chalk, but the writing is there, for all to see, on the digital wall. As of mid-May the online audience for the Telegraph, the Guardian and the Times had soared far above the numbers served by their paper editions. The Mail Online has already eclipsed them.

Even the most enthusiastic defenders of print are having their doubts. Some argue that the web is no more than a fad: a fad, perhaps, but an unstoppable one. I keep meeting editors and newspaper executives for whom the web is the new passion and print their former mistress.

Print is not in decline. The market for quality print, however, is: it is shrinking while digital demand is soaring. The Telegraph is, without question, an internet success story.

His work, for which he has never advertised, is in the homes of actors, authors and royalty, along with private collectors.

C1,Ancient Chinese medicine in the West? Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism massage diet manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions but acupuncture’s role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. The basis of acupuncture lies in the idea that our bodies have meridian lines or channels that run through the skin and down to the muscles. When our bodies are healthy these lines flow freely. When we are sick or injured blockages or stagnations occur along these lines. A person who is feeling pain is thought to have blockages in his or her meridian lines. By stimulating certain points on the skin the acupuncturist attempts to open up the blockages and restore the natural flow of energy called qi. The Western understanding of acupuncture is that it somehow stimulates the body to produce pain killing chemicals like endorphins and enkephalins. It is also believed that acupuncture affects other systems in the body including the central nervous system. Acupuncture treatment usually involves inserting one or more small needles into the skin. There are over three hundred different points on the body known as acupuncture points. The points chosen will depend on the individual’s symptoms. The needles used are very thin and only stay in the skin for a very short time. Some people find the needling process very relaxing and even pleasurable others describe it as being painful especially if the acupuncturist is treating very tense muscles. When the needles are inserted the patient will feel a mild tingling sensation and some people even describe it as an electric shock. It is normal for a patient

Inside there were pictures of him playing with a dog (borrowed from Rodney) standing proudly in empty courtrooms washing his new Porsche and standing on board his new boat in the Bahamas. “Clay Carter, the millionaire ambulance chaser” became his nickname around town, not because there was anything real about it but because it made for great copy. It was one of those stories that got passed around town over a few beers and the next thing you know everyone knew Clay Carter as the wealthy ambulance chaser. In the real world, nobody actually knew what an ambulance chaser was. They all assumed he took advantage of people in their moment of crisis just to line his own pockets.

Clay was never sure how he got the name but he was fairly certain that the magazine article that put it into the public domain was responsible for it spreading. Every time his phone would ring he would think “Who’s next? This has to stop. It’s killing me,” he thought but didn’t really do anything about.

Clever use of colour The colour of shopfronts and store signage is important because it is one of the first things a customer notices. Shops try to attract shoppers by using bright and attention-grabbing colours. Colour can also influence how shoppers think and feel.

I don't want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.’ So runs the logic of Isabel 'our heroine’ in this refreshingly zany novel. An art student of 31 devotee of historical romances she seeks Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances. Her wit, intelligence and charm make her a joy to read and her amorous adventures with the male of the species make for great comedy.

When I wrote the book, I thought it was a romantic comedy set in contemporary London but after several years in the writing wilderness, it was brought back to life, as a light-hearted comedy of manners. What does it say about society, you might ask? Well, it’s about the world of men and women as seen through a certain type of female prism. What else can I say without giving away plot or spoilers?

Well, the story has two main themes. One, the world of men, as a 31-year old art student observes them as she tries to find Mr Right. And two, the trials and tribulations of her own life, which include a career, family, men and a series of misfortunes.

The book was published by Accent Press in 2013. It is available from Waterstones, WHSmith, as an ebook or on Kindle.

C1,"Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. I would like to take a look at some of the leading theories.

1. Brain Tonic
First up is the 'brain tonic' theory. Sleep, says the theory, acts as a way of resting the brain. Just as the muscles in our bodies need rest, so too does the brain. It is essentially a recovery time, a period where the brain can 'recover' and 'reset'. The synaptic connections in the brain which are crucial to its functioning, the theory suggests, are strengthened and reinforced during sleep. In other words, sleep is crucial for mental health, just like physical health. Just as muscles atrophy through lack of use, so too the synapses could deteriorate without the benefit of sleep. According to this theory then, sleep is essential for mental health.

2. Memory Consolidation
A second theory suggests that sleep is important because it aids memory. It is during sleep that memories are consolidated, or fixed, in the brain. This happens particularly during a form of sleep called 'slow-wave sleep', or 'deep sleep'. This is a phase of sleep that happens early on in the sleep cycle. During this time, the brain is thought to be reviewing all the information it has received during the day. In effect, it is organizing the information and filing it away, creating order out of the 'noise' of the day. According to this theory"
C1,"Is your office working ok? Fresh air and the right chairs are the key to a happy healthy workforce according to a new survey. We went to four contrasting offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist who studies people’s working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. A few surprising revelations.

Alastair Hanton runs Hantons, a design firm, which specialises in creating offices that are healthy and sustainable for their occupants. The firm uses the Feng Shui design and philosophy in creating healthy workspaces.

According to Hanton, office space should be a balance between two extremes. At one end is the “white-collar” type of office space with air conditioning, heating, and high technology; and at the other end is the “blue-collar” type of space with natural ventilation, natural light, and no technology. The goal is a balanced mix of both that is both technologically equipped and green and healthy.

The building health consultant said that, first and foremost, a healthy office space should have adequate ventilation. He explained that ventilation is a major factor in a workplace, but the most common mistakes made are not providing enough air, poor air filtration, and not using ventilation systems properly. He also emphasised the need for good lighting, not only in terms of brightness, but also in terms of colour and temperature. Natural light was recommended as much as possible.

The ergonomist said that the design of the chair in the office plays a very important role in the health of the workers. An ergonomically designed chair should be comfortable, and should support the lower back, especially the lumbar region."

I’m not the sort of person who makes resolutions on New Year’s Eve. Not because I think them ineffectual, although I’m sure they often are, but because I’m invariably in bed by midnight nursing a cold or a hangover.

However, resolutions do seem to work for some people and we shouldn’t make fun of them just because our own lives are as shambolic as the aftermath of a particularly chaotic cocktail party.

New Year resolutions, like diet fads and detox programmes, are a symptom of the fact that we humans are not very good at taking care of ourselves. We don’t need them if we eat the right food, exercise a bit, and take care not to drown in booze or tobacco smoke.

But let’s face it, that’s too boring for us. And then, as soon as we’ve stopped sniggering at other people’s feeble attempts to stay off chocolate or spend a whole Sunday doing housework, we might just wonder why we aren’t trying to be a little bit more responsible about our own existence.

C2,"Writing by hand and on screen Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over. But, at the time, they were all I could do.

I did try to teach a dog some tricks. He only had a few in his old age and his memory wasn’t as good as it was in his prime. He had a few tricks left in his old age and he seemed to remember them better in a new home.

I will try to write and write until I have found some meaning in my writing. Some people get bored with writing and don’t want to put the effort into it but it is important to do so. Writing can be a lot of fun and it can also be a way to find out what you are thinking and feeling.

As I have written a lot in my life, I have found that some of the things I have written have been good, but most of it has been bad. That’s because writing is hard work and it takes a lot of effort to make it worthwhile. If you don’t put the effort in, you won’t get anything out of it.

If you want to write, you have to write a lot. The more you write, the better you become at it. So I try to write a lot, even when I have writer’s block, and it helps me to overcome it. I also try to edit my writing as I go along, so that I don’t have to do it later. This is a good habit to get into."

It was only slightly larger than the width of a car and the smell of damp and dead foliage met me at my feet.

C2,"Einstein Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist and the chances are they’ll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias. Yet the image has little to do with the man himself. Einstein is best known for his theory of relativity, and the equation E=mc2 which has become the symbol of nuclear physics. He did not, however, invent the atom bomb.

Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, on March 14, 1879. His father Hermann, was an engineer and his mother Pauline, was a housewife. He had one sister, Maja, who died young. As a child, he was not particularly good at school and had trouble concentrating. He had no interest in sport but showed an early talent for music and played the violin and piano.

Einstein was not one to sit quietly at home, and when he was seventeen, he left home and travelled around Switzerland, Italy and France looking for a university to attend. He eventually joined the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where he studied mathematics and physics. In 1905, he became an assistant at the Patent Office in Bern and published a number of papers, including one that proposed a method of splitting the atom. This was not a revolutionary idea at the time.

In 1909, Einstein moved to Berlin to take up a professorship at the University of Prague. He married Mileva Maric, a fellow physicist, and they had three sons. However,"

However, although there are hundreds of charts and atlases available, far fewer of them are available in cartographic form than before. There are very many books and magazines on astronomy, and many of these are concerned with amateur astronomy. The basic needs of an amateur astronomer are: A telescope or binoculars. There are different types and sizes of telescope. Binoculars have the great advantage that they require far less maintenance. They are also a good way of getting started, especially if one is uncertain of one’s commitment. Binoculars are also a great help in locating objects when a telescope is being set up, and are valuable for use during daylight. They are invaluable for finding the Sun during solar eclipses, when it may be too dark to read the setting circles of a telescope. In addition, as stated above, they are essential equipment for an eclipse expedition.

The most common telescopes are:
• Refractors (lenses)
• Reflectors (mirrors)
• Catadioptrics (combination lenses and mirrors)

In practice, the refractor and the catadioptric types predominate and the reflector has become somewhat specialist equipment.

The most important thing in choosing a telescope is to choose the aperture (the diameter of the objective lens or main mirror) that you can"
C2,"Art In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique revolutionary shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago.

Modern times have, then, created an interesting situation: the demand for the artist whose work is truly original, yet the desire to imitate the great art of the past - and, most of all, to believe that it is possible to do so.

This contradiction is more than just the typical human weakness of thinking we can achieve what the great master have done and do better.

The great masters - and they are few - have created an art tradition that is not only a powerful force in human consciousness, but also an absolute necessity in our spiritual life. They have built a structure upon which artists today must build. We are still dependent on what they have given to us. It is important to understand that the tradition which our great masters have founded was their gift to us; if we imitate them, we can only be followers. Yet, at the same time, we must go beyond them, not imitate, but be in dialogue with their work.

The fact that we have come to view any significant advancement in art as being a radical shift away from tradition does not mean that the tradition itself is static and unyielding. It is, in fact, a living thing, flexible, constantly evolving, and changing shape in the hands of its practitioners, the artists.

Great artists do not come along often. The great traditions they establish are not easy to leave behind, but only through the efforts of artists who are"
C2,"Fashion Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point. By the sixteenth century European artisans and entrepreneurs had established well-organized international trade in textiles. By this time the word fashion was used to describe the prevailing styles of cloth. The trade was dominated by merchants from Flanders and Italy. These merchants and the artists and artisans who worked for them helped to spread the new styles. The Flemish town of Bruges in particular became a centre for the trade in fashionable textiles. For the first time, as far as is known, there was conscious copying and imitation of specific styles. At the same time some styles and garments became associated with the upper class and some with the lower. In this way clothing came to be associated with social status. For much of European history before this, status had been determined by inheritance or acquisition of land or other material assets rather than by the wealth, success or fashionableness of its inhabitants.

Fashion in Renaissance Italy

In Renaissance Italy, the wealth and prestige of certain families led them to seek distinction by means other than the mere display of possessions. One was the cultivation of an aesthetic awareness, the ability to appreciate or even create beauty. In the sixteenth century this could be achieved in part by dressing in the latest style and by having in one's household talented artists or craftsmen able to create beautiful objects.

Renaissance Italy was home to many of the"
C2,"Metals It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. It turned out to be gold.
Apart from a few chance discoveries, man’s first knowledge of metals came from the observation of how the copper and tin ores had changed in the natural process of smelting. A group of men who had been roasting copper ore in a hearth noticed that the air around had turned blue and smelled of copper.
The use of metals developed slowly and steadily through a process of trial and error. Early man knew only two metals- copper and gold, copper being the more accessible.
Gold was used mostly as an object of adornment. Gold jewellery from the early stages of its usage have been excavated from the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus valley.

Copper also served as the basis for many other metals to be developed later. By about 4000 BC, man had discovered that by heating copper ore and removing the impurities, a better copper could be obtained. This copper was then alloyed with other metals, mainly tin to produce the first bronze.
Bronze was a revolutionary discovery. It was stronger, harder and much sharper edged than copper or stone and was thus used for making weapons and tools.
By around 2500 BC, the discovery of iron was made in Asia Minor. Although its production was crude and the results unsatisfactory, it"
C2,"The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. Light was the essence of a photograph, of course. In every photograph I had ever taken, it was light that told the story, that revealed the hidden secrets of whatever it was that caught my lens.

Vienna has always been a romantic city. Its history echoes of the Habsburgs, the culture of Mozart, the elegance of Strauss. One would never guess the war that had just begun. The atmosphere of the city was as calm as a summer's day. That was the way the diplomatic world liked it. In Vienna, they would talk, they would negotiate.

I had been sent there by the American Intelligence Agency. I had a photograph to take that they wanted, a photograph which I found to be extremely peculiar. My first day in Vienna, my assignment was simply to gather background information.

As the days went by, Vienna became as familiar to me as any other European city. The Danube flowed by, its waters crystal clear, the architecture was superb. I wandered the streets, admiring the buildings, watching the people, and always with my camera in hand. I didn't think to be particularly cautious. Vienna was, after all, a neutral country and the war seemed far away.

It was while exploring the city that I first saw him. He was a tall man, with a pale complexion and dark hair. He moved confidently, with a certain elegance"
C2,"Enough Sleep? Tiredness it is often claimed has become the modern condition. As the richer busier countries have grown so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings.

Sleep Disorders affect most people at some time in their lives. For many the problem is occasional and of little long-term significance but others, about one in five, suffer from more frequent and severe disorders.

However, few physicians and health officials are equipped to handle these disorders. In the United Kingdom there is one sleep-disorders specialist per one million population compared with one gynaecologist per 20,000 and one cardiologist per 12,500.

There has been very little recent funding for research into this problem and the only widely-available treatment is medication, which some researchers claim may only aggravate the situation.

The research team led by Professor Colin Espie of the Edinburgh University Sleep Centre argues that sleep disorders are treatable. According to Professor Espie, ""Changing lifestyle and behaviour is crucial and the same advice might be given to a smoker wishing to stop smoking."" The Edinburgh-based team is working with the Department of Health and NHS Lothian to set up a centre that can advise and support sleep disorder sufferers. The centre will also research different treatments, including medication, lifestyle and behavioural interventions.

Sleep-disorder sufferers may be reluctant to seek help, fearing that there may be no hope of achieving a normal and regular sleep routine. This, however, is not the case as most people can improve their sleep"
C2,"Air-conditioning There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer’s unusually high temperatures the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so in fact that at quiet times the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic.

“It’s like an ice box,” says one young man who has just finished his workout. “I’m freezing!”

There is a similar sentiment among most of those who work out here, and with temperatures due to plummet even further in the coming days as Britain braces itself for autumn it could be a long and cold winter for many City workers.

Meanwhile, back in the city, and the latest figures from the Bank of England are showing that the average level of credit extended to businesses and households in July was GBP42.8 billion, a record high.

As a result, the central bank has increased the amount of cash available in the banking system, by a further GBP200 million, to ensure that the money supply doesn’t go into free-fall. The figures show that businesses are borrowing more money than they have done in any previous month since records began.

For many of those working in the City the prospect of an icy cold fitness centre will prove an appropriate metaphor for a time of growing uncertainty, as the credit crunch starts to bite.

With property prices falling sharply, mortgage lenders are tightening their lending criteria and many are now struggling to service their debt. A similar situation exists for commercial property developers who are finding it increasingly difficult to raise the money necessary to fund their activities.

C2,"THE WELL I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched eyes wide fist to mouth as I winched up the well bucket steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. As I dropped into the darkness I felt that familiar pang of vertigo and as you called up to me a second time I shouted down, “What?” The water splashed up in a white froth as I flung the bucket into the well I felt the cold water around me and then the dark bottom against my heels. I clung to the wall while I felt it out as you watched over. I shined the flashlight in its bowl and then you gave me the light. It dangled by its string around my neck like a second heart and illuminated the black walls with its weak glow. I listened to the well water splash and you told me to give a holler when I got there. I shined the light above me and the blue sky was a wound in the roof and it looked good to see. As I descended still deeper I felt that I was floating down into some other place. We’d left our bottles of water at the top so we could know if we drank the bad stuff. Then you said, “Take the light” and I did and I felt a new fear then. I clung to the walls as I looked around at the damp earth and the gray brick and the stone. As the cold air went through me I felt an urge to climb back up and say to you, “I won’t do it, after all.” But I didn’t say a word. And the walls of the well"
C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day.

The house, a Victorian pile, was as it had been three days ago when he left it in the morning, the air thick with a lingering miasma of disuse. The carpet was worn and frayed, the plaster cracked, the upholstery faded, the curtains moth-eaten and old and even in the stagnant air one could smell an underlying dampness that seemed to permeate through the house like an unseen miasma in a deserted marsh town.

Ralph crossed the hall, opened a door and entered the front parlor, a gloomy old room whose only feature was a small and narrow looking-glass that hung against the dark panelling. As he reached the door, a sudden breeze entered the room, a gust of wind, though the window was shut.

“Hadn’t that been left ajar?” he asked himself as he noticed the draught.

No, he was sure he had closed it; yet now it was wide open. This disturbed him, for the weather was very still, a hot calm day, and a draught was unusual.

Stepping into the other room, he saw the window open but the sashes were secured on both sides. He had not the courage to go close to it on account of the draught; but he noticed something peculiar in the room. The sun"
C2,"Heritage The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously we feel connected to our personal heritage usually we know who and what our grandparents were and we will have heard stories about how they lived.

We share and treasure these stories and also our grandparent’s physical inheritance – their possessions, photographs, furniture and decorative artifacts.

But we don’t only have a connection with our immediate family heritage, we also have a connection with the local community, regional, national or sometimes even international heritage.

It could be from our ancestors’ lives and work during the industrial revolution, the Victorian age, or even earlier, or the way our parents and grandparents celebrated holidays and significant life events. We inherit the landscape, the views, the way the town has developed, the architecture and the buildings that are still standing today.

Some people are drawn to heritage in order to explore their identity and a sense of belonging. Others are fascinated by the history and want to learn about the events that have shaped the lives of those who lived before. There are many people who are passionate about preserving the heritage of a particular place because they feel that it gives a sense of authenticity.

Heritage also gives a sense of continuity and roots. It is important for children and young people to understand how the past has shaped the present and that it will also shape the future.

For all of these reasons heritage is significant as it provides a connection with the past, a sense of identity and belonging, a sense of continuity and an understanding of how the past has shaped the present.

C2,"Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare’s play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. He made an admirable Othello in Stratford and he does it even better now. There were other small niggles about the show when it first came around, but they’ve been polished away, leaving us with a show that has matured beautifully.

Iago’s seduction of the Venetian general is so seductive, the jealousies and jealousies so palpable, that you don’t want it to end. It is a production that, thanks to director Jonathan Miller’s touch, is unflinching, in the way great tragedy should be.

Fearon is a magnetic actor and the other members of the cast – especially Peter de Jersey as Iago, the poisonous poison – are magnificent.

C2,"Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal.

The reality is very different: lions tend to hunt alone or in small groups and are more likely to get their heads taken off by rival males than to succeed in the kill. The lion’s image as social animals is also reinforced by their behaviour at kills. After a successful hunt they do something that bears do not. Rather than consuming the carcase on the spot, they cover it with grass and go back for their share later. They also share their food with their pride mates and cubs. And while a male lion may be at the head of the pride, the females do most of the actual hunting.

Agricultural Origins Lions, known to the Ancient Egyptians as Mafdet, were considered by ancient people to be of the most sacred significance and were one of the first animals that ancient humans began to tame. It is believed that lions may have been the first animals in general to be tamed by the ancestors of modern humans.

It has been proposed that these domesticated lions were used for many purposes, including for hunting as well as in religious ceremonies. This is based on the observation that the domestication of other big cats, such as the tiger and cougar, followed a similar timeline and has been proposed as having similar purposes.

C2,"Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition.

The billionaire has announced that he has purchased an unused Russian Soyuz spaceship, which will be sent on the 501-day Mars mission with a married couple to act as “sociological experiments”, and is offering to fund the mission.

Tito, who was the world’s first space tourist in 2001 when he spent eight days on the International Space Station, told the New York Times, “We want a middle-aged couple in good physical and emotional condition.”

However, Tito has made it clear that he will only fund the mission, and will not be a participant himself.

“NASA asked me if I would go to Mars and when I said no, they were very disappointed. I was always hoping to lead by example, but I think that this is more important than me, and if I can promote the manned mission to Mars, I think it is a wonderful thing.”

The 68-year-old American billionaire will contribute up to $100m in seed funding towards the private mission. Tito was a co-founder of the commercial space company Space Adventures, which is arranging the trip.

The couple selected will need to endure a year-and-a-half-long journey to Mars and back, with the possibility of being stranded if things go awry.

C2,"Garbage in garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be. Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip. Now an idea has taken hold in several countries and spread to others: that local authorities, or the lorry operators themselves, should charge families for each bag of rubbish they throw away. It is a plan which seems to have much going for it. The charge, typically £2 or so per bag, gives households an incentive to generate less rubbish, which in turn means fewer demands on valuable landfill space. At the same time it offers municipal authorities a simple and inexpensive means of raising money, which they can use to fund recycling facilities and other environmentally useful initiatives. That is surely a good thing. A waste of money The idea is not, however, as new as it may seem. Some British towns tried the system out in the 1980s. But that experience suggests that charging for rubbish may not be all that simple or helpful. The idea at that time was to put a value on waste which had previously been given away free. And what it turned out to be was a value of next to nothing. At first, local authorities tried to get families to pay for each piece of rubbish, but they found that people did not like to be so easily fleeced and would strenuously avoid paying. It soon became clear that to make the scheme practical and economically worthwhile it would be necessary to give households large discounts on the cost of waste disposal, which in turn meant that the municipal"
C2,"Goat Racing I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans hordes of people food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. As it was in its early phase I had a better chance of a good spot. I was right in front of the starting line, next to a group of locals who were obviously avid goat-racing fans.

## Goat Racing: Goat races and their value

To the uninitiated, it may not be immediately obvious why goats are ridden rather than being let loose to run of their own accord. Like horses, goats have to be trained to understand that when their rider grabs them round the neck, they are being asked to gallop faster. This means teaching them not to be naughty and buck the rider off. Goats are unpredictable; they are stubborn; they are flighty; they are tricky. To get a goat to race is a tricky business, but when it comes to racing, nothing beats a goat.

And so, my thoughts were abruptly interrupted by the deafening wail of a whistle. And then, it all started. The first goat took off, at lightning speed, to the amusement of all. The goat that I was betting on, was not doing quite so well. But I had an idea.

I had just met a guy who claimed to be an expert on goat racing. According to him, goats are very intelligent creatures, as intelligent as humans, and it is their cunning and dev"
C2,"0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. In addition, oral evidence is not subject to the same checks and balances as written documents. Yet there is something special in the human element of history, and in allowing the past to come alive through the voices and experiences of those who witnessed it. For this reason, the use of oral history is a valuable source for historians, although it requires meticulous methods of investigation and interpretation. 292 The Importance of Interpretation 12. In the last chapter it was pointed out that the way in which oral history is recorded can greatly affect its reception. Interpretation also plays a crucial role. Even if the content of the oral evidence is accurate, the way in which it is presented will influence the reader’s understanding. A number of devices and techniques can be used to assist with this process. 12.1.1 A Narrative Approach It is generally more effective to present the testimony in the form of a story rather than simply a collection of facts and opinions. By creating a narrative, the reader can better follow the development of an individual’s life or experiences, and the context in which events took place. In addition, a narrative approach helps to illustrate the influence of particular social and historical conditions on the actions and decisions of the individuals concerned. 12.1.2 Analyses and Interpretation As with other forms of historical evidence, interpretation is essential to enable the reader to make sense of oral testimony.

The van said Susan noticed ‘Removers of Distinction’ and indeed every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables and his team of helpers not so gentle. The front garden was full of furniture and other items that were once in the house, now waiting to be loaded in the van ready to move to a new home. The garden looked disheveled with empty boxes strewn about, and the sadness of Susan could be felt in the air. Susan felt her life was being dismantled piece by piece, her memories wrapped up and moved away. The removal men called to say they were almost ready to leave. Fred asked her to step outside and she obliged reluctantly, she had no idea if there would be anything to go back to. It was a clear morning a bright sun heralding the change of life’s seasons. They walked out into the garden and into a vision, two swans glided across the pond, they moved in perfect harmony, like a dance, they were beautiful in their simplicity, so serene, just like Susan was not. But what she didn’t realise was that they were being followed by a herd of sheep, Fred and his crew of helpers all dressed as sheep. As they were herded into the van they bleated and mooed.

C2,"Screen Learning A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. ‘I’m a little dinosaur’ he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. He told me all sorts of things; that they were very big, lived in the past, had thick skulls, large sharp teeth and were very scary. There was nothing about the scientific theory of extinction, their classification, their role as predators, or even the concept of bones. Then I was thinking about my ten-year-old daughter and her reading habits. She reads lots of books and is very excited about reading the Harry Potter series. But when we discussed her ideas about dinosaurs she didn’t really know much about them either. She knows that they are huge and scary creatures and that they died out. In fact, my daughter once said, ‘I’m glad I didn’t live at the time of the dinosaurs because I would have been eaten.’ When she was asked to explain the process of evolution and whether humans evolved from dinosaurs she couldn’t remember. When I asked my younger son who is eight, if he knew any facts about dinosaurs he said he knew they lived millions of years ago and that he has seen movies about them. As a family we have also been to the Natural History Museum in London where there is a large exhibition of dinosaur fossils but still they don’t know much about them.

C2,"Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it.

The stranger had obviously chosen a bad time to make his move. On his way into the grove, he had encountered a young female monkey, who was having a rather heated argument with her mother. The two screamed and lunged at each other as they quarrelled, and the stranger had taken the opportunity to get a better look at the group. Unfortunately for him, his movements had not gone unnoticed.

As the group watched the stranger, one of the younger males, a recent arrival himself, called loudly and abruptly to a nearby group of females who were feeding on nearby trees, ‘Stranger Danger!’ He shouted this warning repeatedly, and other males of the group soon joined him in their cries of alarm. The females were frightened by the outburst, and they scattered as fast as their tails could carry them, leaving the stranger to face the remaining males in a crowd of growling and furious monkeys.

When the dust had settled and the strangers’s intentions were clear, the other males of the group left the grove to investigate further. The females, meanwhile, were far too frightened to venture back into the danger zone for some time. They were not entirely innocent in all of this.

The group had been expecting the arrival of some new males, and they were understandably concerned that the stranger’s arrival might disrupt the existing male-female relationships. They knew that, after a new"
C2,"AESTHETICS By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. But aesthetic theory cannot be formulated about them as physical things. This is not because aesthetic judgments cannot apply to things external and physical, but rather because there is, at present, a vast range of things which do not have to be either internally or externally 'real' to be aesthetically valuable and which indeed often do not have the slightest resemblance to the conventional 'art.' In addition, aesthetic theorists are constantly being confronted with objects that are ambiguous as to their status (works of a very particular kind of 'pop art' for example). We have also to take account of the fact that art objects now have a history, an individual, and a social, history, and that their aesthetic values do not exist in a simple and straightforward way in the objects themselves, but are the effects and expressions of the history of the objects. To begin to develop an aesthetic theory able to accommodate these things, one has to begin with a definition of art that is as open as possible. There are, no doubt, many more questions which can be raised as well, but these are a few which have occurred to me. We must ask what is the meaning of the term 'art' or 'artwork' and whether it has a meaning at all. Art has an 'open' history. Can we identify a single essential element of artistic creation? Is art a 'natural kind' and, if so, what is the criterion for recognizing"

But of course it is an essential part of the seaside experience and as such I try to make the best of it. A beach holiday with a good friend is much better than a week alone in a hotel room. The beach itself can vary greatly. A beach I went to in the south of England as a child has gone since then – a very thin strip of land between the sea and an old brick and concrete factory. It seems odd that people in the UK would go and sunbathe at a place with such industrial scenery in such a wet country. Perhaps its better to think of it as a metaphor for mans determination and endurance and to see the industrial elements of the beach as sculptures rather than just eyesores. The most unforgettable beach in my experience was on a Greek island called Santorini where huge cliffs rose steeply up from the sea creating a beautiful bay. We found the perfect spot on the beach itself and swam out to where the sea was as green as the mountains behind us. My idea of paradise. But perhaps I should look closer to home and realise that every beach has some merits even if they are not obvious. For instance as well as providing an idyllic location for bathing and a sunbathing it can also be a rich source of fun and entertainment. For me the best fun a beach can offer is water sports but of course these can be as varied as the beach themselves. There
C2,"Art on TV Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details. But what usually results is something that looks like a video version of a museum guide book, and which has as much excitement as a lecture on the history of the alphabet.

For a long time the BBC had a flagship arts magazine show called A Brush With Fame which had a title that perfectly caught the snobbery that it so obviously embodied. The show started off promisingly with Jonathon Meades, a writer who makes no secret of his disdain for TV, as presenter. But for some reason the producers couldn't resist the temptation to turn a show about art into a show about 'celebrities'. It's not that the two things have to be mutually exclusive, and occasionally A Brush With Fame came up with a good pairing of a famous person with a particular painting, but it also frequently degenerated into a celebrity chat show where the 'artist' was asked about their latest film/book/TV programme.

When I heard that a new TV art magazine show was being broadcast on Channel 4 I was hopeful, especially as it was billed as a successor to A Brush With Fame. However, even from the opening credits I knew it wasn't going to match up. The title - The Big Picture - immediately set off alarm bells as did the use of an irritating musical cue on entering each section, but it was the introduction of Kirsty W"
C2,"The Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. These verbal encounters, which are meant to generate curiosity and sympathy in the audience, are often marked by a cynical self-awareness that turns into a circus of self-congratulation and posturing. In their eagerness to establish their bona fides, actors sometimes overdo things, and the public, wary and resistant to such performances, turns away even more. I, for one, am never more inclined to see an actor’s work than when he or she is the most self-effacing. It’s as though the shimmer of artifice disappears in the shadow of the humble.

There are several reasons why actors should beware of the temptations of self-promotion.

1. Lack of Sincerity: People who work in the arts are often required to wear their heart on their sleeve, so to speak. To achieve this level of openness, a certain degree of vulnerability must be embraced. The moment one feigns this vulnerability to gain sympathy, the authenticity of the whole endeavour becomes suspect. Actors must strive to make their work transparent and meaningful, and this demands honesty about the process.

2. Styles and Genres: Actors who are conscious of the need to prove their legitimacy in the craft often fall into the trap of mimicking their peers and predecessors. They do this by"

Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change.

Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve?

Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood and even among individuals who have won eminence there is often bitterness behind the fame. The whole concept of the profession, with its traditional image of expertise and status, is being destabilized by the erosion of authority.

Yet at the same time, a new source of self-respect is appearing: the ability to build relationships. Our work involves increasing levels of cooperation; our leisure pursuits bring us into contact with people whose company we can value for its own sake. A relationship-builder must be as skilled in the ways of the heart as a professional is in the techniques of his specialization.

Relationships are the basis of all human achievements. They are how we do things together that we cannot do alone. At first, this was limited to face-to-face contacts. Then came the telephone and the letter, followed by the telegraph, fax, and e-mail. Next came the ability to broadcast to the whole world, to television and radio, and now to the whole electronic universe. But these new means of communication have not yet produced genuine communities or relationships - at least not in the sense of two or more people"
C2,"Language You and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth they will soon be exchanging words. There are of course exceptions, but the power of language to help us connect and make sense of the world is undeniable. The power of language can be understood in two ways, the transformative power of language and the shaping power of language. The transformative power of language is the ability to change the way a person feels, thinks or behaves in a dramatic way. By using words we are able to inspire, influence, persuade, encourage, comfort, soothe, excite, challenge, motivate and instruct. The power of transformative language lies in the way we use words to generate emotions, to encourage others to feel and act as we wish.

Transformative language has been used to great effect by politicians, preachers and psychologists throughout history, but it isn’t just these professionals who use transformative language in their everyday lives. Everyone has the ability to use transformative language and the effects of this can be seen all around us. Transformative language is particularly powerful when used in the service of a noble or worthy cause. It can, however, be misused as well. When used to manipulate or control, it can be destructive and damaging. Transformative language can also have a profound effect on our perception of the world and our ability to achieve success.

The shaping power of language is the ability to shape events in the world around us by changing the way others see things or act. This power comes from"
C2,"Kinetic Art Rejoice — the well-nigh impossible has happened: London’s austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not thankfully by some huge-budget mega-hyped multi-media extravaganza but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century.

Momentum: 20th Century Kinetic Art opens up to the public at the Hayward, South Bank Centre, from 10 March to 9 June.

Kinetic, or motion, art has had several definitions — the most prevalent of these is ‘art which is concerned with movement’. This was the most ambitious of all forms of art in the twentieth century — and perhaps the most elusive. This was not an easy world to capture. In the words of the exhibition’s curator, Andrew Wilson, Kinetic art’s ‘proponents hoped for a synthesis of the visual, the tactile, the audio and the temporal’.

The exhibition is the first to celebrate the art of movement and includes more than 100 works by 30 artists. Kinetic works range from the 1920s — which saw an outcry in the London Evening Standard from John Betjeman against the introduction of moving images in the Victoria and Albert Museum — through to the 1980s — which saw a proliferation of video and digital installations.

The history of kinetic art in Britain is largely unknown, as is that in the rest of the world, with the exception of the USA. It is an art form which has been largely overlooked until now.

The exhibition is divided into four sections: The Mechanical Muse (19"
C2,"Paul Simon Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked with their destinies. There is one name above all others, one figure that looms over the entire pantheon of rock’s heroes and antiheroes, its fallen and its victors. Paul Simon first gained prominence as half of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, whose soundtrack to the 1967 film, The Graduate, gave them an almost instant national profile. Together, they became two-thirds of Simon & Garfunkel (Arthur Garfunkel being the other third) and as a team they created some of the most beautiful, harmonically complex, melodious and intelligent folk-rock ever recorded. It’s a sound that has stood the test of time, one that still fills concert halls from Sydney to New York, London to Los Angeles.

Born in Queens, New York, in 1941, Simon grew up in a music-rich environment – jazz at home and the doo-wop and R&B from the streets – which helped shape his ear. At school, he played drums and sax, and from an early age he was deeply engaged with music history. As a teenager he bought Elvis Presley’s first single and, more importantly, Chuck Berry’s ‘Roll Over Beethoven’, which he played again and again on his guitar.

C2,"POETRY RECITALS At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. We see the rise of a poet, of a school of thought, as clearly defined in his moment and in his milieu. But the very success of a poet, or the emergence of a literary movement, is, in fact, not an event of one time or place, but of a complex of times and places, each of which has a different validity, in that the historical time of the poet is not that of his work, nor is the place of the poet that of his work. As long as the historical time of the poet and his work is conceived, the idea of a living poetry will remain vague and uncertain and it will seem to be just so much that the poet lived at a certain time and wrote poetry then, or a school of thought and other poets and writings of the same time and place, in which these works are only one item among others, all equal and of equal validity. It is only when we understand that the historical time of the poet and his work is not the same, and that the historical time of the poem or the work of the poet lies elsewhere, that the significance of poetry can be defined and the distinction of works can be understood.

To say that poetry is not merely a product of a certain time and place and that it rises and falls in the human mind by reason of influences of which man is often unconscious, is not an attempt to make poetry a universal art which transcends the limits of race"
C2,"CRYING Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness. Now further research on the science of tears, which include an enzymatic analysis of the biological components of tears, has suggested that they might be even more important in maintaining our well-being. According to research at the University of California, a chemical analysis of tears shows that these liquid drops contain pain killers and stress reducing hormones. In a paper published in ACS’s Journal of Proteome Research, an elite group of scientists, led by Raul Donazar from the Department of Pharmacology at the University of California, analyzed several enzymes found in tears and found that they include a variety of proteins and peptides that function as analgesics (pain killers), anti-inflammatories and anti-anxiety, anti-depression agents. The scientists further analyzed a protein called RNAase7 in tears to confirm its antiviral properties. A protein found in tears could offer a new way to fight viruses. RNAase7 is already known to have antiviral activity, but the results show that levels of this protein in tears are considerably higher than previously thought. RNAase7 is found in the ‘mucous membranes’ of the respiratory tract and the ‘lachrymal glands’ (tear glands), and it is believed that during times of intense weeping the concentration of this enzyme increases, providing a natural defense against viruses. The researchers propose that the"
C2,"Blogging: Confessing to the world Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into. But the author went a step further. He argued that by regularly ‘checking in’ at different places, a pattern is built up. You are painting a mural of your life. A mural of your life that anyone can wander past and examine. And, like an amateur painter, if you are not careful, you are leaving traces of your personal life on the canvas that you didn’t mean to. It’s an interesting point. A good blogger has to confess: his or her writing isn’t just about the facts. It’s a story about him or herself. My blogs are about me, about what I believe and what I think. I can’t write from behind a cloak of invisibility – without declaring anything about me. I can’t keep myself out of my writings. Even in what I think is a simple analysis of theology or a brief look at a historical event, my own beliefs and presuppositions shape and interpret these subjects. There is always something of me, always a bit of my own life woven into every post – even the ones that don’t seem to say anything directly about me. So that means I have to be prepared to admit that. I have to be okay with my readers knowing who I am. I have to be okay with my life being on show. That means being honest – even on the blog.

C2,"Food There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting. Not so! This book is full of recipes which are incredibly simple to prepare yet have the potential to impress and are delicious to boot. There are lots of vegetarian and vegan options as well as recipes with meat, fish and chicken, so if you fancy something specific it's likely you will find something that appeals.
I find the descriptions of ingredients and the instructions very clear and easy to follow. They are in a conversational tone so you don't feel you are reading a formal recipe book and I love the occasional little story that the author throws in. There are recipes for almost every meal of the day - from breakfast through lunch and supper - and there are loads of suggestions for parties and snacks and things that can be made in advance and reheated. The pictures really are appetizing and mouth-watering and I am always inspired to try a few more when I see them. I think the only possible downside is that it might be nice if there were pictures of all the recipes rather than just selected ones but that's just me being fussy! I am definitely going to try to cook some more recipes from this book because they all look so tempting.

The only trouble is, the food won't look half as good as in the pictures and I doubt that anyone else will eat it quite as quickly if it was served at home! One of the best things about this book is that the author encourages you to improvise"

It is on the face of it an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long pressured menial - and badly paid. My own motivation seemed perverse.

C2,"TIM RICE I was ushered into the young man’s drawing room an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class. I was asked how much of the job I had read, to which I replied “nothing”. I had, however, skimmed the summary of Act 2, so I had a rough idea of what I was in for. I was asked if I would like a cup of tea. I said I would.

The young man took out a tray with tea, milk and sugar and a mug.

You can imagine the horror of the scene: two mugs on the tray!

It was as if I had walked into a scene from the Wizard of Oz. I had to choose between two different paths.

The mug that I chose to drink from was the mug of good fortune.

And so it began. A discussion about what might be in it for him, or should that be for me? A lot of hand wringing, some pacing up and down and the odd reference to the fact that it was, after all, only a job, and that there were others out there looking for a job as well. “I was looking after it,” he said, “but, it might be you that’s better, but who knows?”

He offered me some kind of role in a scheme to do with the promotion of this thing to the rest of the world. A chance to get in at the ground floor of this exciting project. A chance to prove myself. The way he described it made"
C2,Advertising on trial If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. But as the recession hit the world economy with more force than any forecaster had expected there were some sectors of the advertising business which found their own specific problems that were even more difficult to overcome. The most obvious difficulty that advertising agencies are likely to face in the new business climate is the problem of winning new clients. During the boom years of the 1980s the amount of new business being won increased every year. In the first four years of the 1980s the amount of new business increased by more than a third and in the second four years of the decade the growth was more than 60 per cent. In the last four years of the decade the value of new business increased by a staggering 153 per cent. Thereafter the figures fell from one year to the next. In 1990 and 1991 the value of new business fell by more than 10 per cent. In 1992 it dropped by nearly 18 per cent. By the end of 1993 the value of new business in the advertising market was still nearly 30 per cent below its peak level of 1989. 2 It was not only the number of new accounts won by ad agencies that fell. The total amount of business was also smaller. 3 It was not only the amount of new business that decreased. The nature of new business also changed. One
C2,"How to Write Poetry Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. I will, therefore, make some general suggestions on this matter, without being responsible for any ensuing explosions.

Firstly, let's consider the basic elements of poetry: sound and sense.

Poetry can, by definition, be seen as sound. Rhythm and cadence are what make poetry special compared to prose. They work with or against the meaning of words and can alter their meaning by the way they are pronounced, by the pauses, and by the pacing of the language. This aspect of poetry comes down to two elements: line and stanza.

Line is the way a poem is broken up into sections. There is no strict rule on how many lines a poem must contain but it is a good idea to aim for the right length. The line length should be suitable for the message it is trying to convey. For example, it would be unsuitable to write ""To be or not to be"" in one long line because it would lose its meaning as soon as it went beyond one's breath. It would not be as melodic or musical as the original line, split into two:

To be, or not to be.

Stanza is how these lines are divided in sections or larger parts. The choice of stanza depends on the mood and on the purpose of the poem. Stanza also helps the mind organize the thought. When we read poetry aloud, we often use the musical"
C2,"Online Literary Criticism For All Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun? From the outset the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice however a certain amount of technical know-how was required at least in the early years.

This meant that anyone who could not afford a good computer or access to the Internet was left behind, at least as a content provider. But, in the spirit of the Web, content consumers certainly did not lack options.

C2,"The two sisters kept Lily’s driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement) before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone.

She loved it.

It was another month before they decided to tell him. “We just couldn’t bear to see her being so happy and not telling him. It was a decision that was difficult but we hoped it would be okay in the long run.”

Chen was thrilled. He just couldn’t believe she had been doing it for a month without telling him. He insisted on accompanying her on the next trip.

So how does this experience connect with your life right now?

You might be feeling as if you are stuck in a life you don’t particularly enjoy, yet are not sure how to make changes. You may have a small secret you have been keeping from a loved one, like Lily did from Chen. Perhaps the fear of change or the uncertainty of what will happen if you tell is holding you back. What Lily and her sisters did was a kind of controlled experiment. They knew that Chen would be supportive and wouldn’t make her stop. If he had been angry or critical, they could have reverted to the old way of things.

What if you were to tell someone close to you what you are feeling right now, even if it is just one person you trust? How might that change the way you feel? What if you took baby steps in the direction of the new life you want, just like Lily drove slowly and carefully along the roads she had never driven before?

Paul Evans reports There's a bump bump bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird a bird of portent augury and divination.

Later in the week he turns his attention to ravens, once associated with the Norse god Odin. Raven's feathers had the magical properties of being able to help the weaver of tales to recount great yarns.

At the other end of the scale is the lark - not the migrant songbird but the cockerel with a top hat.

When one of our chickens dies, we hang it up in the kitchen and say our prayers, and the lark is one of them. And the lark is, I think, one of the most important birds and one of the most ignored. I think I first knew of the lark through the Bible - you know, the Psalm 91 about the eagle and the lark. And of course it's a very common bird so it seems a bit funny to say that it's special - but it's an extraordinary bird.

Although it seems strange to some people, there's nothing funny about what Paul Evans does: he is a culture consultant and expert on mythology and folklore. He believes that understanding the place birds have in the myths and stories of our ancestors is key to understanding our own culture.

C2,"Every Picture Tells a Story Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer but also illuminating. Working on a script I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point. The challenge of course is to come up with something that will do the trick on a single screen or page rather than several pages. The great thing is that cinema is all about pictures as much as dialogue. Every scene in a film has to work both visually and emotionally. Otherwise, the audience will lose interest. This is why most novelists are not good filmmakers. Their books may contain wonderful descriptions of a character or a mood or an event, but they usually don’t have a visual or emotional point. This is also why adaptations can work so well. The best adaptations take advantage of the strengths of film and eliminate the weaknesses of the novel. This is why the original novel is often sacrificed in the interest of a more effective and satisfying film. (Read more at the link...) ——————— For full article: Huffington Post

C2,"The Heat is On We’ve all heard of global warming but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives? Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. Some scientists believe the world will get hotter by as much as 4C over the next few years, though some predict a much smaller increase of just 2.5C. That seems a relatively small change, but even a small temperature rise can have major impacts on climate. Just a 1C rise in temperature can have devastating effects. The world has never experienced a rise in temperatures as fast as 0.5C per decade. We are now experiencing a temperature increase of around 0.5C per decade and if this continues we could be looking at an increase of 2C by 2080. So will we be living in a hotter world with frequent storms, droughts and melting ice caps? Climate change will affect us in many ways. Coastal areas will be flooded as rising sea levels melt polar ice. Droughts in Africa will worsen, and in North America, hurricanes and storms will become more frequent and more violent. Changes in temperature and rainfall may affect food production, leading to food shortages in developing countries. Many people will be forced to move, and millions could be at risk of losing their homes. So how can we tackle this global problem? The key is to reduce greenhouse gases, which are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, increasing global temperatures. Greenhouse gases are found in many areas including in car exhaust fumes.

C2,"Maps The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth’s surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction.

There are many types of maps that use different ways to express these relations and different purposes. For instance, topographic maps show topographical details with relief shown by contour lines or shaded areas, while road maps express the relations of streets and towns or cities in such a way that a person can find his way from one location to another.

The two-dimensional nature of a map, however, requires that a certain degree of simplification be applied. This simplification is necessary, because if all details of every map were expressed in their actual relative sizes and shapes, the resulting map would be extremely difficult to read.

On the other hand, the simplifications may create misunderstandings. Therefore, it is important that the user of a map is aware of these simplifications. In other words, he should know “how to read a map”.

The most important map distortions and the way to interpret them are the following.

A. Cartographic Projections and Distortions

When transferring the earth’s surface, which is curved, to a flat map, certain distortions are unavoidable. These distortions can be caused by the way we project the earth onto a plane. Some of the most common types of projections are as follows:

1. Mercator Projection: This is a cylindrical projection. As the earth’s surface is wrapped onto the surface of a cyl"
C2,"HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. His name, along with that of his two rivals for the South Pole, Captain Robert F. Scott and Edward A. Wilson, is synonymous with heroism and disaster. The story of the Endurance, his 1914 quest to become the first to traverse the Antarctic continent, is a familiar one, even to those who have not read any of the many books about it. The crew of the Endurance sailed the world from a ship that was in danger of splitting in two most of the way, survived in sub-zero temperatures for two years on ice and snow, and finally escaped in a lifeboat over the treacherous Weddell Sea with all hands, including every member of the crew, alive. If this all sounds like it was taken straight out of a Hollywood script, it is. A recent BBC documentary was subtitled 'The Epic Journey of Sir Ernest Shackleton: Hero of the Antarctic.' And now this great British hero has found a second life in the United States, as a management guru of sorts. It is hard to imagine how this could have happened, because his life and career have nothing to do with the world of management, and certainly nothing to do with making money. However, what Shackleton had in abundance was something that American executives have been sorely lacking in recent years: vision. 'You cannot hold Shackleton's leadership up against modern-day leaders"
C2,"Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain. In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. But the digital revolution presents a paradox. On one hand it offers extraordinary new ways of experiencing music. On the other it can be seen as an erosion of the traditional formats for music. As music technology advances we are also faced with new dilemmas. One of the most challenging and contentious issues is the extent to which the commercial viability of a music career is affected by this.

The speaker's tone can be characterized as formal. This can be understood from the careful use of formal language and syntax. Susan Hallam maintains a neutral tone throughout the discussion. This is evident from the fact that she doesn't express strong opinion on any of the discussed issues.

Some important ideas introduced in this discussion include the impact of digital technology on music. She points out that the digital revolution is a paradox as it offers new ways of experiencing music while also eroding traditional formats for music. Another idea is the challenges faced by musicians as they struggle to maintain a music career in a rapidly changing world.

Based on this passage one can infer that Susan Hallam is likely to be associated with the field of music or technology or both. She possesses considerable knowledge and insight into the subject matter. Her discussion is thorough and comprehensive. Her ideas are logically structured and coherently presented. The passage reflects a complex understanding of the topic at hand. The discussion is insightful and it is clear that Susan Hallam has devoted considerable thought to her"
C2,"Holiday reading Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are of course intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. Few things can transport a mind to a different time or place as effortlessly and effectively as a novel, a memoir, an essay, a poem. So, in the warm, restless month of August, a perfect place to read is almost anywhere outdoors—on a boat, at a beach, in a garden, or at a park. Here are 10 books I would highly recommend. The selection includes fiction and non-fiction, history and poetry, and represents a range of subjects and genres. Read full essay here

Dystopian novels in India If ever an entire genre of fiction emerged as a response to the events of a particular time, it would be the dystopian novel that came into being in the mid-20th century. The dystopian novel, with its gloomy forecasts of the future of humanity, reflects the anxieties and fears of writers about oppressive regimes, ecological disasters, and technological calamities. India’s dystopian fiction writers reflect anxieties and fears that pervade society, about inequality, corruption and the threat of globalisation. They offer their readers a dark mirror in which to see India.

Here is a list of 10 dystopian novels published in the 21st century that present readers with alternative images of the present. Read the complete essay here

C2,"Photography When a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills personal views and experience together with a set of social and cultural norms. A photograph is a two-dimensional surface and therefore can only record this visual information as a two-dimensional projection. By selecting this specific information, the photographer is able to use the camera as a tool with which he or she can communicate with the audience and through which he or she can project their personal vision of the world. This is the nature of photography. The selection of visual information is what gives a photograph its meaning.

The photographer selects information on a number of different levels. On a technical level, he or she is required to consider the principles of photography, such as the appropriate focus, shutter speed and aperture setting for the situation. These decisions are based on the photographer's training and personal experience. On an aesthetic level, the photographer makes choices about what is pictorially interesting in the frame of the camera, what is the most effective way to compose the picture, and how to organize the picture in terms of light, color, shape and texture. These decisions are based on the photographer's artistic judgment and creativity. On a social and cultural level, the photographer makes choices based on the cultural norms and social practices that determine what is acceptable and what is not.

All photographs are in a sense 'readymade'. They have been 'framed' by a set of pre-existing social and cultural norms which determine what may or may not be included in a photograph. Photography has become so pervasive and dominant in"
C2,"Family Business ‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father with my brother Maurice in tow had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls’ school I attended. I was 17. It was a bit of a drama. ‘You’re just not cut out for this, you’re going to have to think again about what you’re going to do’. ‘What, are you going to sack me?’ I said, rather cheekily, given the gravity of the moment. ‘No,’ he replied, ‘but I’m going to get someone else in to take your place.’ The conversation continued with him making it clear that if I didn’t come back home and go to work in the family firm I would never be able to return. What he didn’t say was that if I didn’t go to work in the family firm, I wouldn’t inherit the family firm. So that was the moment, quite suddenly, my world changed completely, that’s when I knew that I was not going to be a lady. I was going to be a businessman like my Dad, like my grandfather. My great grandfather and my great uncle.

The family firm was set up in 1850 by my great-grandfather, David Sassoon. It was a bank, not just any old bank, but a very influential, very powerful bank based in Baghdad, Baghdad being the centre of the spice trade at that time. His bank became part of the spice trade and the banking community in the Middle East, which had a profound influence on the"
C2,"Vancouver In the last ten years or so hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver in western Canada. To relax in the evening residents stroll down the city streets and if you join them you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. In the heart of Vancouver is a district called Vancouver West End. The West End is a cosmopolitan neighborhood characterized by its beautiful architecture and high-rise condos, which dominate the area’s skyline. The West End area stretches north from the waterfront of English Bay on the Pacific Ocean in the south, and west from Robson Street, the most famous shopping street of the city.

The most attractive of the beaches of Vancouver is English Bay, which is only a stone's throw away from downtown Vancouver. Many of the tourists who come to Vancouver for the first time usually begin their visit at the bay, which is characterized by its stunning sandy beach and a myriad of activities on offer for everyone, young and old. From here you can see the amazing skyline of Vancouver and the nearby islands in the Pacific Ocean.

English Bay is one of the best places in Vancouver for watching the sunset. Many locals and tourists find a comfortable space on the beach or on the steps of the surrounding buildings to watch the fiery sunset over English Bay. It is also popular in the summertime for swimming, beach volleyball, rollerblading, and in-line skating. The nearby area is filled with a variety of restaurants and cafes.

If you are looking to stay at an exclusive and comfortable accommodation in the West End, you will be impressed with the wide range of options available. In fact, the"
C2,"MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house I learned that opera is in fact only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That’s as it should be of course. It’s an amazing experience to see great opera singers on stage, but if they can’t sing then it’s not really opera. That might sound like a very simplistic opinion but it’s actually a very important point. Opera is, at its most basic, about the human voice – and not just any voice, but a voice trained and disciplined and skilled to the highest level to produce sounds that would be impossible for an ordinary person to replicate. So the singers may be called actors, they may be called performers, they may even be called artists but when it comes down to it, the primary consideration is that they must have an amazing voice.

In the world of theatre there are a lot of very fine actors, in fact there are some genuinely wonderful performers, but you rarely find a theatre performer who is also an opera singer, and never an opera singer who is just a theatre performer. That’s because opera requires a very different skill-set. There is a lot of similarity in terms of the basic physical and psychological challenges of performing in front of an audience, and there is also a lot of similarity in terms of how stories are told. But the way in which they are told and the level of skill required is very different.

So in the theatre, in all its many forms and genres, what does matter most? Is it the music? It never used to be, not for me anyway"
C2,"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology 'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. (Ashcroft, 2000: 1)

In the 1920's, when we think of modernism, we think of the 'Roaring Twenties'. A period in which all types of media such as radio, film, and later television, where being broadcasted across the world with great optimism. We were on the verge of a great change, the change that would shape the future of broadcasting. It would bring with it a new era of entertainment, news, advertisement, politics and so much more. Radio broadcasting was the first of these new technologies.

Although a new technology, it was not new to the masses. People had been making use of radio waves for years, whether it be for communication purposes, military strategy, or even just experimenting with the new technology. By the 1920's, radio was beginning to be taken seriously as a new way to share information and entertain.

In terms of broadcasting, radio was beginning to reach a larger audience than ever before and at a much more frequent rate. Where before people were limited to reading or hearing the news, they now had the choice to tune in to radio broadcasts whenever they pleased. The audience began to grow as people started to realize how they could benefit from radio. People needed radio.

The technology itself was rapidly improving with the advancement in equipment and know-how. The '"
C2,"Writing Reviews Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner’s point of view. Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. That is, the work they refer to may be overtaken by the next day’s news, by other books, or simply by more thoughtful or intelligent reviews. The reviewer therefore cannot hope to make a lasting contribution to the world of ideas or literature. On the other hand, reviews are very important indeed – they do make a difference – so it is a kind of service that has to be provided without thinking too much about lasting impact. The writer must be ready for the reader to be more knowledgeable than he is. He must not attempt to sound like an expert, or rather, the truer expert he is, the less he can get away with appearing in that guise. He must appear to be a fellow reader, one who is ready to take as much pleasure in the reading as he hopes the reader will take in the book under review. Reviewers are, in other way than one, like clowns, and should be given the same freedom as clowns have to be uninhibited and to do what they do as well as they can. Reviews should not be too long, or too short, or too serious, or too frivolous, or too earnest, or too lazy; the reviewer who tries to meet all the possible qualifications for a good review will get into trouble. He may not be able to get the job done properly if he tries to live up to all the images of what a review should be."
C2,"Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941 despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst its alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. It’s hard to imagine the sheer shock the audience must have felt as they watched this film. Here is a Hollywood movie that doesn’t play by the usual formula and conventions, that’s shot in an innovative manner and that’s story is told using a series of flashbacks and newsreels. It is now considered one of the greatest movies ever made.

The Wizard of Oz
Another film that was initially panned by some reviewers and not well received when it first came out was The Wizard of Oz. However the novelty of this film, it’s combination of live action and animation, the catchy songs, and the now iconic characters - especially the Wicked Witch of the West who’s green appearance created a sensation back then – helped it gain a wider audience and it became a classic.

Psycho
This is probably Alfred Hitchcock’s most famous movie and certainly his scariest. Made in 1960, it was heavily promoted as the director’s 51st film and a major shock for audiences when it finally appeared onscreen. It was a major commercial and critical success and revitalized Hitchcock’s career. The story, Anthony Perkins as the creepy Norman Bates, and the famous shower scene that shocked and thrilled audiences, have remained with us and are still referenced in modern films and shows.
