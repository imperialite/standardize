A2,Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings like museums to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. The builder is the person who actually does the work. He or she has to make sure that the building is safe and strong. The workers are the people who do the actual work of building. They might do things like carry bricks or mix cement. 101 Dalmatians Some of the most famous buildings in the world are famous because they are beautiful or interesting in some way. The Eiffel Tower in Paris is a famous example of a beautiful building. It is made of iron and is shaped like a giant iron pole. The Great Wall of China is famous because it is so long and stretches across a whole country. The Taj Mahal in India is famous for being very beautiful and having a special place in the history of India. 101 Dalmatians is a Disney movie about a family of Dalmatians who get lost and have to find their way back home. The movie is famous because it is funny and has cute dogs in it. The dogs are called Pongo and Perdita and they have a lot of puppies. Pongo and Perdita have to go on a journey to find their puppies and they meet a lot of interesting people along the way. 101 Dalmatians is a very popular movie and many people have seen it. Some people even have the movie on video or DVD so they can watch it again and again. 101 Dal

A2,"Careful! Fight with your head don't fight with your heart boy!' shouted Bowen. The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter. But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code. Sir Bowen and all the kings princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. But the kings grew greedy and the knights cruel. So the peasants rose up and the Old Code was born. The Code said knights must never hurt the weak or the innocent. They must help the poor and defend the defenseless. 'You are the future of the Old Code Einon!' shouted Bowen. 'You must remember these lessons and pass them on to your children. For the Code is the only thing that keeps us from sliding back into darkness!' 'I will fight with my head and my heart!' vowed Einon. 'I will never forget the Old Code!'

A2,"The History of Farming Before people started farming they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. They grew wheat, barley and dates. Over time farming spread to other parts of the world. In Europe farmers started growing crops like wheat and oats. In America the Native Americans grew maize, beans and squash. The history of farming is long and complex. But it is important because farming has allowed people to live in one place and have a steady supply of food. This has allowed people to build homes and communities. It has also allowed people to have more time to do other things like make art, write books and discover new things.

A2,"ICE-FISHING If you drive north from Toronto for three hours you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter the lake becomes ice and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. This is ice-fishing.  The fishermen sit in their little houses and wait for a bite. They have to be very quiet so they don't scare the fish away. They use special rods with a hook on the end and bait on the hook. When the fish bites, the fisherman pulls the rod and the fish comes up through the hole in the ice. Then he pulls the fish out and puts it in his bucket.  If you go ice-fishing, be sure to dress warmly. You need a warm coat, a hat, gloves, and boots that are good for walking on the ice. You also need a special bag to sit on. This is called a ""ice-chair"".  Ice-fishing is a very popular sport in Canada. Many people enjoy it because it is a chance to get outdoors and enjoy the winter weather. It is also a chance to catch fish for dinner. Some people even eat the fish they catch right on the ice!  If you try ice-fishing, be sure to be careful. The ice can be slippery and the fish can be slippery too. Also, you have to be careful not to fall through the ice.  In Canada, ice-fishing is a fun and exciting winter sport.

For a minute he looked down at me carefully. (We look at a small animal in the same way and think: 'Will it hurt me?') Then he looked up at the sky and sighed. Then he spoke: ' Poor little thing. Don't worry, I'll not hurt you. You're safe now. ' He picked me up gently and put me in his pocket. He walked away with me still struggling in his pocket. He walked for a long time and I was very tired. He eventually came to a farmhouse. He opened his pocket and put me on the ground outside the door. I was so relieved. I was very tired. I closed my eyes and slept.

""But even as I thought these words, I knew that they were not true. I was in pain. I was in torment. I was in the grip of something that I could not control.

A2,"BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window.
Inspector Saunders advises people to be vigilant and to check their doors and windows before going out. He also suggests that people use timers to make it look like someone is home, even when they are not.
The most common time for burglars to strike is between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. This is because many people are out at work or running errands during these hours, leaving their homes vulnerable to break-ins. Burglars know that this is the prime time to strike, and they often take advantage of the opportunity.
In addition to being vigilant and checking doors and windows before leaving the house, there are other steps you can take to protect your home from burglars. For example, you can install security cameras or an alarm system to deter burglars and alert you to any potential threats. You can also consider investing in a smart doorbell with a camera, which can allow you to see who is at your door and communicate with them remotely.
Overall, it's important to be aware of the potential for burglary and to take steps to protect your home and your belongings. By being vigilant and taking proactive measures, you can help prevent burglars from targeting your home and keep your belongings safe.

Then Jenny spins the wool into yarn and knits the sweaters. She sells them at the local market. They make enough money to live comfortably and have a nice farm. Stephen and Jenny have two children. Their son, Simon, is 10 years old and their daughter, Sarah, is 12 years old. Simon helps his father with the cows and chickens. Sarah helps her mother with the sheep.

A2,"Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and‚Ä®make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their‚Ä®homes at night. Otters are very good in the water and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair and this keeps them warm in the water. They also have sharp claws and a long tail that they use to swim.
Otters are very good at hunting. They eat fish, crabs, and other small animals. They can hold their breath underwater for a long time. They also have a special way of swimming called a slither. This means they can slide through the water very fast.
Otters are very friendly animals and like to play with other animals. They also like to rest in the sun and bask in the warmth.
Otters are very important to the environment. They help keep the rivers and lakes healthy by eating fish that might eat too many plants. They also help keep the rivers and lakes clean by eating dead fish and other things that might pollute the water.
Otters are very interesting animals and are fun to watch. They are also very important to the environment.

A2,"The history of horse racing From the first history books ever written it is clear that horse racing has‚Ä®always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. The first race is believed to have taken place in the 16th century at the Hippodrome in Constantinople. The sport then spread throughout Europe and the world, with the first race in the United States taking place in 1774. Today, horse racing is a major sport with races held all over the world. It is also a popular spectator sport, with many people attending races in person or watching on television. The history of horse racing is long and rich, with many interesting stories and facts. Here are some of the most interesting and little known facts about the history of horse racing: 1. The first known horse race took place in Central Asia around 4500 years ago. The race was held in honor of the goddess Epona, who was revered as the protector of horses. 2. In ancient Greece and Rome, horse racing was considered a sport for the elite. The races were often held as part of religious festivals, and the winners were rewarded with valuable prizes. 3. The first written record of a horse race in Europe is from the 12th century, when the Byzantine Emperor Alexios Komnenos wrote about a race held in Constantinople. 4.

The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there. Last spring Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had been born there but their mother had been killed by a fox. Bill decided to raise them himself. He had a special pen built for them and he fed them and took care of them. The geese grew fast and soon they were ready to fly. Bill took them to a nearby lake where they could learn how to find their own food. Bill was very sad when the geese left.

The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. Some were as small as chickens, others as big as a house. Some had feathers, some didn't. Some were plant-eaters, some were meat-eaters. Some had sharp teeth and claws, some had flat teeth and no claws. Some had long necks, some had short necks. Some had big tails, some had small tails. Some dinosaurs were herbivores (plant-eaters), some were carnivores (meat-eaters). Some dinosaurs were omnivores (ate both plants and animals).

A2,"Piano players - when they were young Ivan Petrov Ivan was born on a farm in Russia but from the age of twelve to eighteen he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from the opera. His mother began to teach him the piano when he was six. She would play and sing to him and his sister, and he learned by ear. He began to study formally at age 12, and by 15 he was performing in public.

When Ivan was 16, his family moved to Moscow and he began to study at the Moscow Conservatory. He studied piano with the famous teacher, Lev Vlassenko. Vlassenko was a great teacher, but he was also very demanding. Ivan had to practice for hours every day. Vlassenko made him play scales and exercises over and over again until he could play them perfectly. Ivan had to perform in recitals and concerts, and he also had to play in the conservatory's orchestra.

At 18, Ivan won the first prize in a piano competition in Moscow. This was a big deal, and it helped him to get a scholarship to study music at the University of Indiana in the United States.

A2,"There were many big fights at that time. People fought on horses with swords in their hands. The strongest and best knight always won. 'Perhaps the new king will come to the fight' thought the Archbishop. Sir Ector went to the fight with his two sons Sir Kay and young Arthur. The fight was between Sir Lionel and Sir Gawain. Sir Lionel was the best knight and he won the fight. 

The Archbishop was very angry with Sir Lionel and said, 'You have won the fight but you have lost your honor. You have fought with unfair means and you are not a true knight.' Sir Lionel was very sorry and he said, 'I am sorry I fought unfairly. I will do better next time.' The Archbishop said, 'There will be a next time, for there is always a next time for a true knight to prove himself.'

The story is about a tournament, where knights fight each other with swords and horses. The Archbishop is upset with Sir Lionel because he won the fight by using unfair means, and he says that Sir Lionel has lost his honor. Sir Lionel is sorry and promises to do better next time. The story emphasizes the importance of fair play and honor in knighthood.

The story also highlights the idea that a true knight must always prove himself, and there will always be opportunities for him to do so. The Archbishop's statement suggests that being a true knight is not just about winning fights, but also about acting with integrity and fairness.

The story is also significant because it introduces the character of Sir Kay, who is one of the sons of Sir E"

Like all their other friends they enjoy going fishing or swimming at weekends. But for the last few months they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. They are creating a video game!

Frazer is the artist, Peter is the programmer. They work together, Frazer designs the characters and the environment, Peter writes the code and makes the game work. They are having a great time and they are really good at it. They are making a game that they would love to play themselves.

But, as time goes by, their weekends are becoming less and less fun. They spend more and more time in Peter's room, sitting in front of the laptop, coding and designing. They are neglecting their friends and their hobbies, and their grades at school are starting to suffer.

One weekend, they decide to take a break and go fishing. But as soon as they get to the lake, they start to think about their game and they can't stop. They start to argue about the game and how it's not working the way they want it to. They are not having fun anymore and they realize that they have lost sight of what's important.

They decide to take a step back and re-evaluate their priorities. They understand that they can't let their game consume their whole lives and they need to find a balance between their passion and their relationships with their friends and family. They come to the conclusion that they will continue to work on their game, but they will also make time for other things they enjoy, like fishing"

I hope this letter finds you well. It's been a while since we last spoke, and I wanted to reach out and see how you're doing. I'm currently back in my home country, but I can't stop thinking about the friends I made during my time in England. Specifically, I think about you and the good times we shared in our English class.

I'm afraid my visit to England was too short, and I found myself getting attached to the place and the people. I even cried when I had to leave, which I know might seem silly, but it's just how I feel. I would love to return to England someday, but next time I would like to stay in a different city, maybe London or Manchester, so I can explore more of the country.

I hope you remember me, Maria. You were such a kind and supportive classmate, and I will always be grateful for the time we spent together in class. I hope you're doing well and that life has treated you kindly. Please take care of yourself, and if you ever find yourself in my home country, do let me know.

Barack Obama was shocked and grief stricken by the news. His father had been estranged from the family for many years, but he had still been a presence in his life. Obama had been in contact with his aunt and his half-sister in Kenya over the years, but he had not seen his father in person since he was ten years old.

As he struggled to come to terms with the loss of his father, Obama began to reflect on the complex and often difficult relationship they had shared. He remembered the times his father had taken him on adventures around Nairobi, showing him the sights and sounds of the city he loved. He remembered the way his father had taught him how to play chess, and how they would spend hours together, lost in the game. He remembered the way his father had disciplined him, sometimes harshly, but always with the intention of teaching him right from wrong.

But Obama also remembered the times his father had been absent, the times he had been distant and unavailable. He remembered the way his father had struggled with alcoholism, and how it had strained their relationship. He remembered the way his father had left his mother and him when Obama was just two years old, and how that had left a deep scar on his psyche.

As Obama processed his grief, he realized that his father"

Every morning I took some guns and walked about three miles to my place on the hill. I always brought guns and ammunition with me because I wanted to be prepared for anything that might happen. I was very scared of those cannibals. I was always ready to shoot them if they came too close.

But one day, something strange happened. As I was walking back to my place on the hill, I saw a group of people following me. They were not cannibals, but they were strange looking. They had long hair and wore strange clothing. They were also carrying guns and ammunition. I was very surprised because I had never seen these people before.

Do you think the man was a cannibal? Why or why not?

Yes, the man was a cannibal. The text states that he was more intelligent than 500 cannibals, which implies that he was a cannibal himself. Additionally, the man's actions, such as moving guns and other things to a bigger cave, suggest that he was preparing for a violent confrontation with other cannibals. The fact that he was scared of the cannibals and always brought guns with him when he went to his country house further supports the idea that he was a cannibal.

No, the man was not a cannibal. The text does not provide any evidence to suggest that the man was a cannibal. In fact"

A2,"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today there are policemen everywhere but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were no rules about how to run the city, so there was a lot of crime. In 1700 a man named Sir Robert Walpole decided to do something about the crime. He was the Prime Minister of England at the time and he wanted to make London a safer place for everyone. So he created the first police force in London. The police force had 500 men who were called ""watchmen."" These men were responsible for keeping the peace and arresting criminals. The watchmen were not very well trained, but they were very brave. They carried sticks and clubs to defend themselves and they were very willing to fight criminals. In 1829 the police force in London was reorganized. The new police force had more men and they were better trained. They also had new uniforms and they were called ""bobbies."" The bobbies were very popular with the people of London. They were very friendly and they were always willing to help. They patrolled the streets on foot or on bicycles and they were very good at their jobs. In 1856 the police force in London got even better. The government built a special building for the police called Scotland Yard. Scotland Yard is still the headquarters of the London police today. The police in London have always been very good at solving crimes. They have a special team called the ""detective department"" that is responsible for"

Sometimes she stopped and listened. She came to a door with a light under it. She opened the door and saw a room full of strange objects. There was a big stone in the center of the room, and a small table with a candle on it. Mary felt a shiver run down her spine. She did not know what to do. She was about to close the door and go back to her room when she heard a voice. 'Hello, Mary,' it said.
Mary looked around, but there was no one there. She heard the voice again, 'Hello, Mary.' She looked at the table and saw a small, old man sitting there. He was dressed in a long, white robe and had a kind face. 'Who are you?' Mary asked. 'I am your friend,' the old man replied. 'I have been waiting for you.' Mary was surprised and curious. 'What do you want with me?' she asked. 'I have come to help you,' the old man said. 'You have a special gift, Mary. You can see things that others cannot see. You have a special power.' Mary was amazed. She had always known that she saw things that others did not see, but she had never told anyone about it. 'How did you know?' she asked.

A2,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop age 14 Last summer I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. In the middle was a large pond with a large wooden stage. We waited for about half an hour for the show to start. When it did, the elephants came out one by one and walked around the stage. They were so tall and big, with wrinkled skin and big ears. The first elephant did tricks, like spinning around and picking up things with its trunk. Then, it was time for the elephant to paint. It held a brush in its trunk and painted a beautiful picture of a tree. The audience gasped in amazement. Next, the elephant played soccer with a ball on its trunk. It was very funny. Finally, the elephant did a magic trick. It made things disappear and reappear on the stage. The show ended and we left the park, all of us very happy. I enjoyed the show very much and I will never forget the elephants. I hope to see them again someday. 

The author of this text is 14 years old and describes an elephant show he attended with his family in Thailand.

By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. The Icehotel in Jukkasjarvi Sweden was born. The first guests arrived in 1990 and since then the hotel has been rebuilt every winter using ice and snow from the Torne River. The Icehotel is a unique and magical place that has to be experienced to be believed. Each winter the hotel is rebuilt using around 20000 tons of ice and 100000 pieces of snow. The rooms are designed and built by a team of skilled ice sculptors from around the world. They use a variety of techniques to shape and carve the ice into beautiful and intricate designs. The hotel has 55 rooms and suites each one different and unique. Some are designed to look like ice palaces while others resemble ice igloos. The guests can enjoy a range of activities such as dog sledding snowmobiling and even flying over the Arctic landscape in a hot air balloon. The Icehotel also offers a range of dining options from traditional Swedish cuisine to gourmet meals. The Icehotel is a truly unique and unforgettable experience that is not to be missed.

B1,Climbing to the top of Britain Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland and because of its northerly location the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. I was with a small group of experienced climbers all with our own reasons for tackling the mountain that day. I was there to test myself physically mentally and spiritually. We set off at midnight and climbed through the night to reach the summit at dawn. The climb was difficult and exposed with steep rock and ice climbing sections. But the real challenge was the cold the wind and snow. We were fully clothed in layers and with gloves hats and goggles to protect us from the elements. The coldest part of the climb was at the top where the wind whipped around the summit. We huddled together to take photos and I remember thinking I can do this but what on earth am I doing here? The climb down was just as challenging with the added pressure of darkness and fatigue. We made it back to base camp at 4pm exhausted and exhilarated. I had faced my fears and pushed myself beyond my limits. And as I looked up at Ben Nevis I knew I would be back again someday. Climbing to the top of Britain's highest peak is an experience that stays with you for a long time. The sense of accomplishment the breathtaking views and the camaraderie with fellow climbers make it a challenge that many people want to repeat.

B1,"THE ROCKIES The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America. They start in the North-west but lie only a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies but the best way to see them is to travel by train. From Denver in Colorado to Seattle in Washington State the Rocky Mounta in Train takes you through the most beautiful scenery. You can see the snow-capped peaks of the Rockies rising up from the prairies. You can see the crystal- clear rivers that flow through the valleys. You can see the forests of pine and fir that clothe the slopes. And you can see the wildlife of the Rockies - deer, elk and buffalo.

B1,"Detective-Inspector Cornish and Chief-Inspector Craddock were discussing the murder at the local police station. 'Mrs Bantry said that Marina Gregg had a ""frozen look""' said Cornish. 'Did she see someone on the stairs? There were two people from America - Ardwyck Fenn and Lola Brewster a film star. The murderer must have been one of them.'

'It's possible,' said Craddock. 'But we need more evidence. The frozen look could have been due to shock or fright rather than seeing someone on the stairs. And we know that Mrs Bantry is not the most reliable of witnesses.'

'Quite,' agreed Cornish. 'But what about the letter found in the library? It was addressed to ""My dearest darling"". Could it have been from the murderer?'

'It's possible,' said Craddock again. 'But we need to be careful. We don't want to jump to conclusions. We need to follow up on all the leads and see where they take us.'

'Agreed,' said Cornish. 'I'll interview the Bantrys again and see if they remember anything else. And I'll also speak to the other guests. Maybe someone saw something.'

'Good luck with that,' said Craddock. 'And keep an open mind. The killer could be anyone.'

In this conversation, Detective-Inspector Cornish and Chief-Inspector Craddock are discussing the murder at the local police station. They are considering the evidence they have gathered so far, including Mrs Bantry's description of the victim's ""frozen look"" and the letter found in the library"
B1,"A few days after this Virginia and her young admirer went out riding in the fields. But a tree tore her riding skirt very badly and when they got home she went up the back stairs to mend it. She was running past the half-open door of one of the rooms when she saw someone inside. She stopped in amazement, her heart beating fast, for it was none other than the young man who had been following her.

He was sitting at a table, his back to the door, and he was writing something in a book. Virginia watched him for a moment, her eyes wide with curiosity, before she turned and ran down the stairs to her mother's room.

""Mother!"" she exclaimed, bursting into the room. ""Who is that young man in the blue room?""

Her mother looked up from her embroidery, startled by Virginia's sudden appearance. ""Why, that is Master Edward, my dear,"" she replied. ""He is a young gentleman from a nearby estate, and he has been coming here to study with me for the past few days.""

Virginia's eyes widened even further. ""Study with you?"" she repeated, her voice full of excitement. ""What is he studying?""

Her mother smiled. ""He is learning to read and write, my dear. He is a very clever young man, and he has a great thirst for knowledge.""

Virginia's eyes sparkled with interest. ""I should like to meet him,"" she said, her voice full of enthusiasm. ""May I go and talk to him now?""

Her mother nodded. ""Of course, my dear. He is"
B1,"Winter Driving Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow waiting to send you off the road. And, of course, it's dark early. So what can you do to stay safe on the road during the winter?

1.	Slow down. The most important rule of winter driving is to slow down. The faster you are going, the longer it will take you to stop if you encounter ice, snow, or other hazards on the road. It's also more difficult to control your vehicle if you are going too fast.

2.	Know your vehicle. Make sure you know how your vehicle handles in snowy and icy conditions. If you have a four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive vehicle, it will handle better in winter conditions. However, if you have a two-wheel drive vehicle, it may be more difficult to handle in the snow.

3.	Check your tires. Make sure your tires are properly inflated and have good tread. If your tires are worn or under-inflated, they may not provide enough traction on icy or snowy roads.

4.	Use winter tires. Winter tires are specifically designed to handle in snowy and icy conditions. They have a special tread pattern that provides better traction on slippery roads. If you live in an area that gets a lot of snow, consider investing in a set of winter tires.

5.	Keep a safe distance."
B1,"LITTLE CAT LITTLE CAT WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? When Bo the cat decided to explore a furniture van she had a bigger adventure than she expected. She was discovered by the driver after he had completed a trip of over 500 kilometres. It was the end of a long day. The driver of the furniture van was getting ready to pull into the parking lot of his home when he heard a faint meowing sound coming from outside the back of his van. He opened the doors to find a tiny cat hiding in a pile of boxes. The cat, who was later named Bo, was dirty and tired but otherwise unharmed. The driver had no idea where the cat had come from or how it had ended up in his van. Bo had been on quite the adventure. She had managed to squeeze herself into a small gap between the van and a nearby building before the driver had closed the doors. She must have fallen asleep while hiding there, and when the driver had started driving, she had been carried along for the ride. Bo was a little scared at first, but she was also curious and excited to see where she was going. She had never been in a van before, and she loved the feeling of moving and the new sights and smells. Bo stayed with the driver for a few days before he found a home for her with a family who loved cats. She was happy and content in her new home, but she never forgot her wild adventure on the furniture van. She would often tell her new family about the places she had been and the things she had seen on her journey. She was a little cat with a big spirit, and she had experienced a bigger adventure than she ever could"
B1,"The next day Emma was pleased to see a lot of snow outside. This was a good thing because it meant she could not go to church and see Mr Elton or go to visit Harriet and none of them could meet. The snow stayed for several days after Christmas and the only visitor to Hartfield was Mr Knightley. He came to see how Emma was doing and to help her with the snow. Mr Knightley was a good friend of the Woodhouse family and had been a great help to Emma when she was feeling unwell. He was a kind and understanding man and Emma was glad he was there to help her.

Emma was relieved that the snow was still falling and that she could not go to church or visit her friends. She was determined to stay at home and avoid Mr Elton and Harriet. She knew that Mr Elton would be there and she did not want to see him. She was also worried about Harriet and her silly infatuation with Mr Elton. Emma knew that Harriet was not thinking clearly and that she needed to be kept away from Mr Elton until she was better.

As the days passed, Emma grew more and more irritated with Mr Elton. She was angry with him for pursuing Harriet and for causing her friend so much distress. She was also annoyed with him for not understanding how she felt about him. Emma knew that Mr Elton did not love her and that he only saw her as a friend. She was tired of being treated like a sister and wanted to be seen as a woman.

One day, Emma decided to confront Mr Elton about his behavior towards Harriet. She knew that he would be at the Vicarage and she wanted to speak"

B1,"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST Hypatia was born in Alexandria in Egypt in 370 A.D. For many centuries she was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books. Hypatia's father was director of Alexandria University and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual as most women then had few opportunities to study. Hypatia became proficient in mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy. She was so good that she became famous throughout the Mediterranean world. She taught at the university and was known for her clarity of thought and her ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms. Hypatia was also an accomplished mathematician and astronomer. She wrote commentaries on the works of the Greek mathematician and astronomer Ptolemy. Ptolemy had written a major work on astronomy called the Almagest. Hypatia's commentaries were highly regarded and helped to establish her reputation as a leading scientist. In addition to her scientific work, Hypatia was also a philosopher. She was particularly interested in the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. She was known for her eloquence and her ability to use logic to defend her views. Hypatia was also a strong advocate for the rights of women. She believed that women should have equal opportunities with men in education and in public life. She was a pioneer in a time when women had few opportunities for advancement. Hypatia's life was cut tragically short. In 415 A.D. a group of Christian extremists attacked her and dragged her through the streets of Alexandria. She was brutally murdered. Her death marked the end of an era of scientific inquiry and intellectual freedom in Alexandria. Despite this tragic end, Hyp"

At my first ballet class I was nervous as I didn‚Äôt know anyone. Everyone gathered round asking me questions all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. They were all very friendly and welcoming. I was amazed at how quickly I had to learn the Russian language. It was a challenge but I was determined to succeed. My teacher was very strict but I knew she was only trying to help me improve. I was so excited when I found out I was going to perform in Swan Lake at the historic Mariinsky Theatre. I had always dreamed of performing in a famous ballet company and now I had the chance. My teacher had been working with me on my technique and I was determined to do my best. I had to learn the choreography quickly and perfect my movements. It was a lot of hard work but I was so happy to be a part of the Kirov Ballet. I had made many friends and was learning so much about the Russian culture. I was so proud of myself when I performed in Swan Lake and received a standing ovation. It was a dream come true and I knew that I had made the right decision in joining the Kirov Ballet.
Nathalie, congratulations on your achievement! It must have been a challenging but rewarding experience to join the Kirov Ballet and perform in Swan Lake at the historic Mariinsky Theatre.

B1,"Sharks ‚Ä®Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks have been around for over 400 million years and they have survived many changes in the Earth's climate. Because of their long history, sharks have developed very efficient ways of finding food and avoiding predators. Sharks are also very good at taking care of their young. They are born alive and can swim and hunt on their own within a few weeks of being born. 

Sharks are a diverse group of fish, with over 500 species, ranging in size from the small dwarf lanternshark, which is only 20 cm (8 in) long, to the whale shark, which can grow up to 18 meters (59 ft) in length. Sharks are found in all the world's oceans, from the shallowest coastal waters to the deepest parts of the ocean.

Some species of sharks are known for their distinctive features, such as the hammerhead, which has a flattened, hammer-shaped head, and the great white shark, which has a distinctive white underside. Other species are known for their aggressive behavior, such as the tiger shark, which is known to attack a wide variety of prey, including other sharks.

Despite their fearsome reputation, sharks are not typically aggressive towards humans, and only a few"

The use of new ideas and advanced computer programs means that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages.

They started to make films with more complex stories and characters, and with a new level of detail and sophistication. The first Pixar film was Toy Story, released in 1995. It was a huge success and showed that cartoons could be just as good as live action films.

Pepys writes about important news stories of the time like disease an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames and the Great Fire of London. He also writes about his personal life including his love life and his job as an administrator at the Navy Office. Pepys was born in 1633 in Salisbury England. He studied at Cambridge University and later became a member of Parliament. In 1660 he was appointed as the Secretary to the Admiralty by King Charles II. Pepys kept his diary for 10 years from 1660 to 1670. He wrote in it every day except Sundays and often included details of his social life and his relationships with his friends and family. Pepys diary is considered a valuable historical document because it provides a unique perspective on life in 17th century England. It is also a fascinating insight into the personal life of a man who was an important figure in the political and social life of his time. Pepys died in 1703 at the age of 70 but his diary continues to be read and studied by historians and scholars today.

B1,The History of Shoes In the past importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today but other materials such as silk plastic or cotton are also popular depending on what is in fashion. Shoes have been around for thousands of years with some of the earliest known designs dating back to ancient civilizations in Egypt Mesopotamia and Greece. In these cultures shoes were seen as more than just a practical item but also as a status symbol and a reflection of one's wealth and social standing. In ancient Rome sandals were popular and were often decorated with intricate designs and adornments such as gold and silver. During the Middle Ages in Europe shoes were mainly made of leather and were often highly decorated with elaborate designs and ornamentation. In the 18th and 19th centuries the Industrial Revolution led to the mass production of shoes which made them more accessible and affordable for the general population. This also led to the development of new materials such as rubber and plastic which were used in the production of shoes. In the 20th century the rise of fashion and celebrity culture led to the popularity of designer shoes and the emergence of new trends such as sneakers and athletic shoes. Today shoes come in a wide range of styles and materials and are an important part of fashion and culture. The history of shoes is a fascinating and diverse one reflecting the changing social and cultural values of different civilizations and time periods. From simple animal skins to high fashion designer shoes the evolution of footwear has had a profound

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College an excellent private college in Wales. Unusually it gives young people much needed experience of life outside the classroom as well as the opportunity to study for their exams.
The students who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world spend the morning studying. They are all bright and motivated and are here to learn and develop their skills.

B1,"No Title A month ago I had no idea that on a Saturday afternoon in November I'd be hanging 30 metres above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me and realised why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. We were both feeling a bit apprehensive about the climb, but our guide Mark quickly put us at ease. We were given a thorough briefing about the safety procedures, the equipment we would be using and the climbing techniques we would be learning. Mark was a great teacher and he had a way of making us feel confident and excited about the climb. On Saturday morning we set off early, eager to get started. The drive to the climbing spot took us through some beautiful countryside and we chatted excitedly about the adventure ahead. When we arrived at the climbing area, Matt and I were amazed at the sheer size of the cliff face. Mark showed us where we would be climbing and we could see that it was a bit more challenging than we had expected. But Mark reassured us that he would be there to guide us every step of the way. So we got kitted up, put on our climbing harnesses and began our ascent. The first part of the climb was a bit tricky, but Mark gave us some great tips and soon we were making good progress. The view from the top was incredible and we could see for miles in every direction. We took a few minutes to enjoy the view and then began our descent. The climb was an amazing experience and we couldn't believe how much fun we had had. We were both exhausted but exhilarated by"

In it were my cheque book address book and my purse which contained about ¬£50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realised what I had done it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old I was a long way from home and I was quite worried. I called the bus company but they couldn't help me. I was very upset and I didn't know what to do.

I'm writing to ask if you can help me get my handbag back. I would be very grateful if you could put the word out in your paper and see if anyone has found it. I live in Newport and I'm sure someone must have seen it on the bus.

I'm also worried about the contents of the bag. My cheque book and address book contain personal information and I would be very upset if they fell into the wrong hands.

I'm sure you will understand how worried I am and I hope you can help me.

B1,"JAZZ By Katie Atkins aged 14 I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools ‚Äì and our band won! Each band had their own costumes ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly-coloured T-shirts. We played our hearts out and really enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun. We played songs from jazz greats like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, and even some more modern tunes. We practiced every week after school for months to get ready for the competition. I was really nervous before we went on stage, but once we started playing, all my nerves went away. I felt like I was in my element, doing what I loved most. I couldn‚Äôt believe it when we were announced as the winners! We were all so happy and proud of ourselves. Winning the competition was an amazing feeling, and I can‚Äôt wait to play in more jazz competitions in the future. 15

B1,"San Francisco San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it was discovered by land rather than by sea. The Portola expedition camped near the mouth of the San Francisco River and named the area Yerba Buena or Good Herb. The area was then settled by Mexican in 1821 after Mexico gained independence from Spain. San Francisco became an important commercial center in the mid-1800s when the California Gold Rush brought a flood of people seeking to make their fortune in the gold fields. The town grew rapidly and in 1849 it was incorporated as a city. San Francisco has a mild climate and a beautiful setting with hills and the Pacific Ocean to the west and the San Francisco Bay to the east. The city is also known for its cultural diversity and its many museums and art galleries. The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most famous landmarks in San Francisco and connects the city to Marin County. The city has also hosted many important events in American history including the 1906 earthquake and the start of the United Nations Charter in 1945. The city is also known for its unique architecture and the cable cars that run through the city. San Francisco is a popular tourist destination and is known for its vibrant nightlife and cultural attractions.

B1,"STAMP COLLECTING - IT‚ÄôS A HOBBY THAT CAN GROW AND GROW Millions of people of all ages enjoy a hobby which is both interesting and fun. And every year more and more people start a stamp collection of their own and discover an interest which can last a lifetime. Starting your collection is easy because stamps are everywhere. You can find them on letters and packages, in post offices, and even in your own home. You can choose from a wide variety of stamps, from modern issues to rare and valuable ones. You can also collect special sets or themes, such as animals, birds, flowers, or countries of the world. One of the most interesting things about stamp collecting is the chance to learn about history, culture, and geography. By studying stamps you can learn about different countries, their governments, and their people. You can also learn about important events in history and the development of new technologies. And because stamps are often printed in limited quantities, many rare and valuable stamps become important collector's items. Some are even worth thousands of dollars. But collecting stamps is not just about making money. It's also a fun hobby that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. You can share your collection with friends and family, trade stamps with other collectors, or join a stamp club.

I‚Äôd only ever acted at school but I'd loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her. I was so nervous when I got the call that I was in the running for the role but I was thrilled when I got it. It's been an incredible experience so far, working with such a talented cast and crew. I feel so lucky to have this opportunity and I can't wait to see how the story unfolds.
Interview with Caroline Benson about her role in The Finnegans.
Q: How did you get involved in The Finnegans?
A: I was at university when I auditioned for the role of Polly Finnegan. I'd never acted professionally before so it was a bit of a surprise when I got the part.
Q: What was it like working with the cast and crew?
A: Everyone has been so lovely and welcoming. The cast is incredibly talented and it's been great to learn from them. The crew is also top-notch and they've made the whole experience really enjoyable.
Q: How does it feel to play a character from such a beloved book?
A: It's an honor to play Polly Finnegan. I grew up reading the book and always identified with her spirit and determination. It's a bit surreal to be bringing her to life on screen.
Q: What can you tell us about the show?
A: It's a period drama"
B1,"Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car recycling wine bottles not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out. I want to be clear about one thing right from the start - it wasn't my idea to become the BBC's ethical man. It was a job offer, and at first I was a bit hesitant. I mean, who is this 'ethical man' character? And what exactly does he do? But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that this could be a really interesting experiment. I'm not a hippy, I'm not a tree-hugger, I'm just a regular guy who wants to make a difference. And so, I set out on a year-long journey to explore what it means to live an ethical life. I started by looking at the little things, the everyday choices that we all make without really thinking about them. Like using plastic bags, or buying products that are made with exploited labor. And I was surprised by how hard it is to avoid these things. It's not just a matter of making different choices, it's also about understanding the systems and structures that make it so hard to live ethically in the first place. For example, did you know that most supermarkets use plastic packaging that can't be recycled? Or that many of the clothes we buy are made in sweatshops where workers are paid poverty wages? It's not just about individual choices, it's about taking on the big corporations and governments that shape our world. And so, I started to look at bigger issues, like climate change and economic"
B1,"We went to the park. We knew of fifty-two sons in prison. We made a circle of lights one for each son. People stopped to look at the dancing lights and came to ask about our campaign. By the time it was dark our camp had grown to more than fifty women. We had a big banner that read ""Free Our Sons."" We gave out flyers and collected signatures for a petition to demand the release of the sons in prison. We talked to people, and they talked to others. The word spread, and our movement grew.

On the second day, we went to the town hall and met with the mayor. We told him about the sons in prison and why they should be freed. We gave him the petition with thousands of signatures. He listened to us and promised to look into the matter. We left the town hall feeling hopeful.

On the third day, we went to the prison. We wanted to meet with the warden and tell him about our campaign. We brought our banner and flyers. When we arrived, we were stopped by the guards. They asked us who we were and what we wanted. We told them about our campaign, and they listened. They took our banner and flyers and promised to give them to the warden. We left the prison feeling proud of what we had done.

On the fourth day, we went to the radio station. We wanted to tell everyone about our campaign and why it was important. We talked to the radio host, and she agreed to let us come on the air. We told our story and played our banner. People called in to ask questions and offer support. Our message spread far and wide.

B1,"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod which means 'far distant place'. The town of Iditarod was built near the base of the Sushana Mountain Range and was home to many miners and their families. As the years passed, the gold rush slowed and the town of Iditarod began to decline. In the early 1900s a man named Dorothy G. Page came to Iditarod with her husband. Page was an adventurous woman who was not afraid to try new things. She was especially interested in dog sledding and soon became an expert. Page and her husband started a dog sledding team and began to race them in local races. Page was determined to make dog sledding a sport that people would enjoy and respect. She believed that dog sledding was the last great race on earth and wanted to prove it to the world. Page started the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1973. The race was 1,000 miles long and started in Anchorage, the largest city in Alaska. The race was to follow the Iditarod Trail which was the original route used by the miners to get to the gold fields. The race was to end in Nome, another town in Alaska. Page wanted the race to be a test of endurance for both the dogs and the mushers. She wanted the race to be difficult, but also safe for the animals. Page also wanted the race to be"

'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time' Ben argued ‚Äôand it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end we gave in. We bought him a set of drums and he's been practicing for two years now. At first we were worried that he would never learn to play properly and that the drums would just sit in the corner unused. But Ben has turned out to be a natural. He's got a great sense of rhythm and he's been practicing for hours every day. He even plays in a band with some of his friends. We're really proud of him and we're glad we gave in and bought him the drums. It's amazing how much joy something like music can bring to a child's life.  As parents, we have had our share of concerns about Ben's drumming hobby. Initially, we were worried that the noise from the drums would be too much for us, and that it would disrupt our daily routine. However, we soon realized that Ben was not just playing the drums for fun, but he was also learning to play them well. He would spend hours practicing, honing his skills and perfecting his craft. Ben's passion for drumming was contagious, and soon we found ourselves enjoying the music he made. We would often sit in the living room, listening to him play, and feeling the beat of the music resonate through our bodies. As Ben's skills improved, he started playing in a band with some of his friends. We would hear the music"

Zoos are institutions that house animals for display and viewing by the public. The history of zoos dates back over 3,000 years to China, where the rulers of the time opened the Gardens of Intelligence, a vast zoo that was used for both entertainment and scientific research. Over time, the purpose of zoos has evolved to include conservation, education, and scientific research, as well as providing a place for people to observe animals in their natural habitats.
In the early days of zoos, animals were often trained to perform tricks for visitors, but this practice is no longer common. Today, the primary goal of zoos is to allow people to observe animals behaving naturally in their environments. This is accomplished through the use of large enclosures and natural habitats that mimic the animals' native environments as closely as possible.

B1,MONEY What is money? The pound the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book a huge bag of sweets or a couple of cinema tickets. But how can something that is only a piece of paper or a tiny chip of metal be worth anything? The answer is trust. Money is a way of trading goods and services but it is also a social construct a way of agreeing on what something is worth. The value of money is not set in stone it changes over time and it can vary from place to place. For example the dollar was once worth a lot more than it is now. And in some countries the currency is not even called dollars or pounds but instead is called something like the riyal or the rand. So what is money? It is a way of trading goods and services but it is also a way of agreeing on value. It is a social construct that can change over time and vary from place to place. It is a way of trusting that something will be worth something else in the future. It is a bit like a promise that you can rely on. And that is why money is so important to us. It is the way we trade with each other and it is the way we plan for the future. Without money we would not be able to buy the things we need or want. We would not be able to save for a rainy day or to invest in something that might make us money in the future. Money gives us the freedom to choose how we want to live our lives and to make the most of the opportunities that come our way. So the next time

It‚Äôs an amazing place as the builders have used wood for the whole thing just like in our old school but it‚Äôs also one of the first in my country designed to be really environmentally friendly.

The structure is designed to withstand winds of up to 100 mph, or about 160 km/h. It also has a 45-degree angle on the outside, which helps to distribute the weight evenly. Visitors can walk out to the Skywalk and look down over the edge of the canyon. It is an incredible sight and one that many people will never forget. The Skywalk also has a glass bottom, so visitors can look down and see the rocks and the river below. This is a great way to see the Grand Canyon in a new and exciting way. Visitors can also take a walk along the Rim Trail, which is a paved path that runs along the rim of the canyon. This trail is 13 miles long and offers stunning views of the canyon. The Grand Canyon is a natural wonder that attracts millions of visitors each year. It is a place of beauty and wonder, and the Skywalk adds to"
B1,"Watering the Desert ‚Ä®It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh Morocco. It doesn‚Äôt happen frequently and when it does the city‚Äôs water pipes can‚Äôt manage the sudden floods which turn the streets into rivers. But as many winters have remained dry in recent times when the rain does come it is welcomed by the local people.
Winter in Marrakesh is a time of hope for the city‚Äôs water supply. It is a time when the water table can be replenished and the parched earth can be revitalized. The rains are a reminder that life can be sustained in this desert city and that the land can still produce abundance despite the harsh conditions.
The rains also bring relief from the heat which can be intense in the winter months. The cooler temperatures and the possibility of rain create a sense of hope and optimism among the locals.
The city‚Äôs water management system is designed to cope with the rainy season. The water is collected and stored in large underground tanks and then distributed to the various districts of the city through a network of pipes.
The rainwater is also used to irrigate the city‚Äôs many gardens and parks. The gardens are an integral part of Marrakesh‚Äôs landscape and are a testament to the city‚Äôs ability to create oases in the desert.
The rains also provide an opportunity for the city‚Äôs farmers to plant crops which will be ready to harvest during the summer months. The crops are an important source of food for the local population and are also sold in the city‚Äôs markets.
The rainy season is a time of renewal and rejuvenation for Marrakesh."

Three years ago Alan Kath and Gareth joined the circus. 'People laugh when we tell them' says Kath. 'They can't believe a family of grown ups would give up their proper jobs to become clowns' But for the Ellis family it's no laughing matter. 'Being a clown is the most honest thing you can be' says Gareth. 'People need laughter in their lives and we're providing it. We're not just entertaining people we're making them happy' Gareth's act is called 'Gareth the Great' and he spends hours every day practicing his juggling and acrobatics. He's a natural clown with a quick wit and a silly grin. And he's not afraid to get a little messy. 'I love making people laugh' he says. 'It's the best feeling in the world' But being a clown isn't always easy. Gareth's face is painted with bright red circles and white spots. His nose is bright red and his eyes are painted on. He's hot and uncomfortable in his costume and he can't wait to take it off at the end of the day. And there are times when the audience doesn't laugh. They just stare at him with blank faces. 'It's hard to make people laugh sometimes' says Gareth. 'But I never give up. I keep going until they crack a smile'

B1,"No Title Some people have complained about this year's collection New Writing 3 although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality for ¬£6.99 is pretty amazing? Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. I also enjoyed the poetry by Carol Ann Duffy and Sean O'Brien. But the highlight of the collection is the non-fiction - from the humorous pieces by Ian Sansom and John Mitchinson to the thought-provoking pieces by John Carey and James Wood. The collection is a bargain and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves reading.

And he settled down to write his letter, the words flowing smoothly and easily onto the paper. It was a beautiful night, and Dr Kemp was grateful for the peace and quiet that had fallen over the town. He wrote for over an hour, only pausing to gaze out of the window at the ships and the moon and the stars.

As the night wore on, Dr Kemp's thoughts turned to the letter he was writing. He had been asked to write a report on the recent outbreak of fever in the town, and he was determined to do his best to provide an accurate and informative account. He had already spent several hours researching the disease, and now he was in the process of writing up his findings.

As he wrote, Dr Kemp's mind raced with thoughts of the disease and its causes. He knew that the fever had been caused by a combination of factors, including poor sanitation, overcrowding, and the spread of disease through contact with infected people. He had seen the devastating effects of the fever firsthand, and he was determined to do everything he could to help prevent its return.

For example adverts for drinks feature cartoon animals. The advertising industry is very skilled at getting our attention and making us want things we don‚Äôt need.
Advertisements are everywhere, and they are often targeted at young people. This is because children and teenagers are more susceptible to advertising and are more likely to influence their parents‚Äô purchasing decisions. The advertising industry uses a variety of tactics to grab kids‚Äô attention, including using cartoon characters, popular music, and funny slogans.
For example, many ads for sugary drinks feature cartoon animals or other child-friendly characters, such as Tony the Tiger for Frosted Flakes or the Trix rabbit. These ads are designed to appeal to young children and make them want to beg their parents for these products.
In addition to TV ads, children are also bombarded with advertisements on social media, online games, and even in their schools. These ads often use catchy jingles or slogans that kids can easily remember and repeat to their friends.

B2,Interview Tips First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress our eye contact our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words. First impressions are important because they can set the tone for how others perceive us and how they react to us in future interactions. Here are some tips for making a good first impression: Dress appropriately for the occasion Research shows that people make judgments about us based on our appearance. Dressing appropriately for the occasion can help you make a positive first impression. For example if you are going to a job interview you should dress professionally in attire that is appropriate for the industry you are applying to. On the other hand if you are going to a casual social gathering you may be able to get away with dressing more casually. Make eye contact Eye contact is an important aspect of nonverbal communication. When you make eye contact with someone you are signaling that you are interested in them and willing to engage with them. Avoid avoiding eye contact on the other hand can give the impression that you are shy or uninterested. Smile and show enthusiasm A smile can go a long way in making a good first impression. When you show enthusiasm and positivity you are more likely to make a good impression on others. Be punctual Showing up on time for an appointment or meeting is an important aspect of making a good first impression. When you are late you may give the impression that you are disorganized or unreliable. Be prepared Be prepared for the occasion by doing research and having

But it was not. It was only a tragic accident. The beautiful and talented soprano, Christine Daa√©, had been suddenly and inexplicably summoned away from the stage, leaving the entire audience in shock and disbelief.

And so, the performance of La Boh√®me continued, with the other singers and actors trying to carry on as best they could, despite the absence of their beloved colleague and friend. But the show was never the same without Christine, and the memory of that fateful night would haunt the opera house for years to come.

The paragraph in the morning's paper had been a mistake, a misunderstanding of the events that had transpired. But the rumors and speculation about Christine's disappearance continued to circulate, and the opera house became a place of mystery and intrigue, a place where people came to catch a glimpse of the enigmatic soprano who had vanished without a trace.

Years passed, and the opera house continued to thrive, but the memory of Christine Daa√© never faded. She became a legend, a mythical figure who had left behind a legacy of beauty and talent, a reminder of the transience and fragility of life in the world of opera.

Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. Their intelligence, playfulness and grace have captivated humans for centuries. But the truth is that dolphins are in trouble. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) warns that the species is facing a ""global crisis"" with many populations in decline. In the past 30 years alone the WDCS has recorded a 40% decline in the global population of bottlenose dolphins, the most common species in captivity. The decline is linked to overfishing and habitat destruction, as well as pollution and climate change. The WDCS is calling for urgent action to protect dolphin habitats and to reduce the impact of fishing on dolphin populations. The group has also raised concerns about the welfare of dolphins in captivity, where many are kept in small tanks and subjected to unnatural conditions. The WDCS believes that captivity is not a suitable environment for dolphins and that they should be protected in their natural habitats. The decline of dolphins is not just a concern for animal lovers, but also for the health of the oceans themselves. Dolphins play an important role in marine ecosystems, helping to maintain the balance of species and habitats. Without them, the oceans could become less resilient to environmental changes and more vulnerable to degradation. As"

So how do you think we can use technology to support face-to-face connections and conversations?
Title: Overcoming the Distractions of Technology to Foster Face-to-Face Connections

Introduction:
In today's digital age, technology has made communication more accessible than ever before. However, this increased connectivity has also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions. As a researcher, I have found that many people feel that technology has gotten in the way of important aspects of their lives, such as deep conversations and meaningful connections. In this essay, I will discuss how technology can be used to support face-to-face connections and conversations, and how we can overcome the distractions of technology to foster deeper connections with others.

I. The Importance of Face-to-Face Connections

* The benefits of face-to-face interactions, such as improved mental and physical health, increased empathy and understanding, and better communication skills
* The decline of face-to-face interactions in the digital age, and how this has led to a sense of isolation and disconnection among individuals

II. Using Technology to Support Face-to-Face Connections

* The role of technology in facilitating face-to-face interactions, such as video conferencing, social media platforms, and online communities

B2,"Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves. In On the Origin of Species published in 1859 Darwin described the process of natural selection. The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. This means that over time species can change in response to their environment.

The theory of evolution by natural selection has had a profound impact on our understanding of biology and the natural world. It has also influenced fields such as anthropology, psychology, and sociology.

In this article we will explore the key elements of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and its implications for our understanding of the world and our place in it.

Key Elements of Darwin's Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection

1. Variation: Darwin recognized that species exhibit variation in their characteristics. This variation can arise from genetic differences or environmental factors.

2. Adaptation: Darwin observed that some species are better adapted to their environment than others. He argued that the 'fittest' individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce.

3. Heredity: Darwin recognized that the characteristics of an individual are determined by its genetic makeup. He believed that offspring inherit their parents' characteristics.

4. Natural Selection: Darwin proposed that the 'fittest' individuals in a population are more likely to survive and reproduce. This process leads to the evolution of the population over time.

5. Speciation: Darwin recognized that species can change over time. He proposed that new species can arise through geographic isolation or other mechanisms.

In the evenings we would sit on the veranda, watching the sunset over the sea and drinking tea and whiskey. It was our own little piece of paradise, and we always looked forward to returning there.

Lombard, from the French town of Annecy, has been climbing for 20 years and has won numerous competitions around the world. He is one of the world's top climbers and is known for his incredible strength and skill. Lombard is a specialist in lead climbing, which means he climbs the wall with his own rope and harness attached to the top of the wall. He is also a master of the notorious ""hangboard"" moves, which involve hanging upside down from his fingers and toes to find the holds and make the ascent. Lombard's climb is a test of endurance and strength, but also a display of mental toughness. As he dangles precariously from his fingertips, he must remain focused and determined to reach the top of the wall.

B2,"However most of the problems were small and most of the guests at the conference were amazed by the network. After this the ARPAnet began to grow even more rapidly. But now it was not the world's only network of computers. After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful other networks began to appear. The ARPAnet was not the only network of computers, but it was the best known.

In 1973 a new network was created, called the NSFnet. This network was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and was designed to connect universities and research institutions across the United States. The NSFnet was modeled after the ARPAnet and used the same technology. However, the NSFnet was not as large as the ARPAnet and it did not have as many connections to other networks.

In 1974 the first international computer network was created, called the Trans-European Network (TEN). This network connected computers in several European countries and was funded by the European Union. The TEN was not as large as the ARPAnet or the NSFnet, but it was an important step towards creating a global network of computers.

In 1979 the ARPAnet was connected to the NSFnet, creating a single network that spanned the entire United States. This allowed researchers at universities and research institutions across the country to share information and resources.

'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. And he's not alone. The average height of adults in the UK has increased by 10cms (four inches) in the past hundred years. So what's behind this growth spurt? Is it just better nutrition, or is there something else going on?

Well, the answer is a bit of both. But there's also something else - something that might just be the most surprising factor of all. It's called the 'Flynn effect'. You might not know it by name, but you'll definitely have heard of its most famous proponent - Michael Flynn, the American academic who first identified it back in 1987.

The Flynn effect is the phenomenon whereby every generation of children grows up to be taller than the last. And it's not just a matter of a bit of extra height here and there. The difference in height between a child born today and one born a hundred years ago is the equivalent of around three-and-a-half inches. That's a lot of growth.

So why is this happening? Well, Flynn himself suggested that it was down to better nutrition and healthcare. As societies have got richer, we've been able to provide our kids with more and better food, and our medical care has improved. That means they're growing up stronger and healthier, and"

B2,"In 1998 the world-class Moroccan athlete Hicham El Guerrouj broke the 1500-metres world record with a time of three minutes twenty-six seconds. Nearly fifteen years later nobody has beaten that time. Have we got to the human speed limit? Dr Frances Ashcroft Professor of Physiology at Oxford University explains the limits of the human body during a race.

Dr. Ashcroft: ""When you're running, the body has to deliver oxygen to the muscles to keep them working. The heart pumps blood to the muscles and the lungs take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. The body has a limit to how much oxygen it can deliver to the muscles and how fast it can do it. This is called the VO2max.""

Reporter: ""So what is the current world record for the 1500-metres?""

Dr. Ashcroft: ""The current world record is three minutes twenty-six seconds, set by Hicham El Guerrouj in 1998. That's an incredibly fast time, but it's also an incredibly high level of physical fitness. To break that record, you would need to have a VO2max of around 90-95 milliliters per kilogram per minute. Most elite athletes have a VO2max of around 70-80 milliliters per kilogram per minute, so there is still room for improvement.""

Reporter: ""But is it possible to reach the human speed limit? Is there a limit to how fast we can run?""

Dr. Ashcroft: ""Yes, there is a limit to how fast we can run. The human body can only"

Jake laughed when first the national TV channels and then Memphis then Jackson then Ripelo ended their broadcasts with no news about the Hailey trial and no pictures of Buckley on the screen. At ten Jake and his wife Carla lay in the dark on the sofa waiting for the news. He had the remote in his hand, ready to flip to the local station if he heard anything about the trial, but there was nothing. He went to bed angry and frustrated, feeling as though he'd been cheated out of the news he'd been waiting for all day.

The next morning Jake called the local TV stations and asked if they had any news about the Hailey trial. They all said no, they had nothing new. He checked the web sites of the TV stations and found nothing new there either. He tried the Memphis paper and the Jackson paper and the Jackson Clarion-Ledger, but they all said the same thing: nothing new. He was starting to think he'd imagined the whole thing, that Buckley had never held that press conference. But then he remembered the sound of Buckley's voice on the radio, the way he'd said, ""Good evening, folks.""

Jake tried calling the radio station where he'd heard Buckley, but they said they had no record of any press conference. He tried calling the courthouse, but they said there was no trial scheduled for that day. He tried calling the DA's office, but they said they knew nothing about any trial.

B2,"Week after week British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people‚Äôs privacy and break the newspaper editors‚Äô code of practice. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion this is not typical. More usually great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page.
This is not the only way in which the British tabloid press invades people‚Äôs privacy. The use of subterfuge, or undercover reporting, is another tactic used to gain access to people‚Äôs private lives. This can involve posing as a friend or acquaintance in order to gain the trust of the individual concerned, and then using the information gained to create a sensational story.
The impact of this type of reporting can be devastating. People may find themselves subjected to intrusive scrutiny, with their personal lives laid bare for all to see. In some cases, this can lead to serious consequences, such as the breakdown of relationships or even suicide.
Despite the code of practice set out by the Editors‚Äô Code, which includes provisions for protecting the privacy of individuals, the tabloid press continues to flout these rules with impunity. This is largely due to the fact that the code is voluntary, and there are no legal penalties for breaching it.
In conclusion, the British tabloid press has a long history of invading people‚Äôs privacy, whether through the use of intrusive photographs or subterfuge. This type of reporting can have serious consequences for the individuals involved, and yet the tabloid press continues to flout the rules with impunity. It is time for the government to take action to protect"

But the strange thing was that the voices in the house went mad. There were thousands of them. They were all talking at once, shouting, screaming, and singing. It was like a madhouse. Paul's mother was terrified and didn't know what to do. She tried to call the police, but they couldn't come because the voices were too loud. They were all shouting at once, ""We want Paul!

Paul was very scared too. He didn't know what was happening and he didn't know how to make it stop. He tried to hide under his bed, but the voices found him there. They were all talking to him, telling him how they wanted to keep him and never let him go. Paul was so scared that he started to cry.

Just when things were getting worse, the doorbell rang. It was the postman with a special delivery. Paul's mother opened the door and there was a large package.

B2,"ICE SKATING Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill. In the 17th and 18th centuries, ice skating became a popular winter sport in Europe. Skating rinks were built in parks and courtyards. The first ice skating club was formed in Sweden in 1742. Ice skating became a popular pastime in the United States during the 19th century. The first indoor ice rink was built in New York City in 1870. The 20th century saw a significant expansion of ice skating. Ice skating became an Olympic sport in 1908. The first World Figure Skating Championships were held in 1908 and have been held every year since. Ice skating has also become a popular form of entertainment. Ice shows featuring elaborate costumes and choreography have been popular in Europe and the United States since the late 19th century. Ice skating has also been used in film and television. The first ice skating scene in a film was in the 1915 movie ""The Skating Princess."" Ice skating has also been used in advertising and politics. The 1980 presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan featured an ice skating rink as a backdrop for his acceptance speech. Ice skating has also been used in sports.

Or have you followed every piece of news on the front page of a news website? It's practically impossible. Reuters alone puts out 3.5 million news stories a year. And that's just one source.

With so much noise, it's hard to know what to pay attention to. It's easy to get sucked into the vortex of news and lose perspective. Even if you try to limit your intake, there's always something more to read, more to watch, more to listen to.

It's time to take back control of your news intake. Here are some strategies to help you stay informed without drowning in the noise:

1. Set boundaries: Decide how much time you want to spend on news each day and stick to it. Whether it's 30 minutes in the morning or an hour before bed, make it a non-negotiable part of your routine.
2. Prioritize sources: Choose the sources you trust the most and focus on them. Whether it's The New York Times, The Guardian, or NPR, make sure you're getting your news from reputable outlets.
3. Use filters: Use news aggregators like Apple News or Google News to filter out the noise and bring you the most important stories. You can also use social media platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn to curate your own feed and avoid the noise.

Readers of this magazine often write in saying 'I have written this story / book. Where can I send it?'. We are always delighted to hear from would-be writers and we do our best to help you find the right place to send your work.

Firstly, let's consider the type of publication you are interested in. Are you looking for a traditional print magazine, or are you interested in online publications? Are you open to submitting to literary magazines, or do you prefer more commercial publications? Once you have a clear idea of what you are looking for, you can start researching the best places to submit your work.

There are many excellent literary magazines out there that are always looking for new and talented writers. Some of the most well-known include Granta, The Paris Review, and The New Yorker. These publications are highly competitive, but if you have a strong story to tell, they may be worth submitting to.

Another option is to look for smaller, independent publications that may be more open to new writers. These publications often have a more personal feel and may be more willing to take a chance on an unknown author. Some examples of these types of publications include The Lifted Brow, The Tusk, and The Rumpus.

Of course, there are also online publications that are always looking for new content. These can be a great way to get your work out there and gain exposure, even if you haven't had any previous publishing experience"

Lovely villages with old temples attract me not empty deserts. When I was eight I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. I would go to the church of St. Mary and St. Felix and sit in the old stone pews. I would think about the people who had sat there before me, about the priests and the monks. I loved the smell of the old stone and the feeling of being in a place that had a history. I found it very comforting.

Answer: Bruce likes places with a history and human element. He finds comfort in old churches and villages with old temples. He doesn't enjoy untamed landscapes and prefers places with a sense of familiarity and history.

Explanation: In this passage, Bruce expresses his preference for places with a history and human element. He finds comfort in old churches and villages with old temples, and he doesn't enjoy untamed landscapes.

Overall, Bruce's preferences are centered around the human element and the sense of history that places with a past offer.

Despite being part of the People's Republic of China, the Walled City had a distinct identity that was shaped by its history, geography, and the people who lived there.

The Walled City was built on a small triangle of land in Kowloon, a suburb of Hong Kong. Over time, the city grew upwards, with buildings piled on top of each other to reach fourteen floors. The density of the city was incredible, with over 30,000 people living in a space of just 6.4 acres. This made it one of the most densely populated areas in the world.

Despite its cramped conditions, the Walled City was a thriving community with its own economy, culture, and way of life. The city was home to a diverse population of traders, laborers, and small business owners, who worked together to create a vibrant and bustling community.

However, the Walled City was not without its challenges. The lack of effective governance"
B2,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE When you first enter the Model Village it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground flat and completely overgrown with brambles. For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land. But then one day a small group of visionary individuals had an idea to turn it into something truly special. They saw the potential in this barren wasteland and decided to create something truly remarkable. And so the Model Village was born. Today it is a thriving community of intricately crafted miniature buildings and landscapes. The village is home to over 100 miniature structures including a church a school a library a hospital and even a working train station. Visitors can explore the village and learn about the history of each building and how it was constructed. They can also watch artisans at work creating new miniature structures and landscapes. The Model Village is a testament to the power of creativity and determination and a reminder that even the most unlikely of places can be transformed into something truly beautiful and meaningful.

As you enter the Model Village, you are struck by the intricate detail of each miniature building and the precision with which they are crafted. The village is a testament to the skill and dedication of the artisans who have spent countless hours creating this tiny world. You can see the church, with its delicate stonework and stained glass windows, and the school, with its tiny blackboards and student desks. The library is a marvel of miniature bookshelves and reading nooks, and the hospital is a tiny but fully functional medical facility. Even"
B2,"Variations on a Theme If you're thinking of taking children to a theme park there are dozens to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to test the best. Fun Island - The Burns family Last year we went to a huge theme park in the US and we thought that Fun Island might seem dull by comparison. But it was actually better than the American one in many ways. The rides were more suitable for our children's ages and the park was much cleaner and less crowded. The best bit was the water park - the kids loved it. We also enjoyed the live shows and the food was good. We would definitely go back. Alton Towers - The Smith family We were a bit disappointed with Alton Towers. We thought it would be bigger and more exciting than it was. The rides were OK but there weren't enough for our children to enjoy. The queues were also really long, especially for the bigger rides. We did like the live shows and the food was good. But overall we wouldn't recommend it for young children. Thorpe Park - The Browns family Thorpe Park was amazing! The kids loved the rollercoasters and the water rides. It was a bit scary at times but they enjoyed the thrills. The park was well laid out and the staff were really friendly. We had a great time and would definitely go back. Chessington World of Adventures - The Wilsons family We were really looking forward to visiting Chessington but unfortunately it didn't live up to our expectations. The rides were a bit tame and the park was quite small. The kids were disappointed that there weren't more rollercoasters and"

I've got to be doing something that's a challenge. If I'm absorbing something new and learning I get tremendous energy. I've got to be doing something creative, whether it's writing a book or interviewing people. I can't just sit around and do nothing. I've got to be using my brain. I'm 65 years old and I'm still working. I've got a lot of energy because I'm constantly learning and absorbing new things.' B. Shirley Conran Author: 'I'm always on the go. I don't sit still for more than five minutes at a time. I'm always doing something, whether it's writing a book, going to a meeting or seeing friends. I'm 60 years old and I feel like I'm just getting started. I've got a lot of energy because I'm always doing something that interests me.

B2,Confident people what's their secret? Confident people may look as though they were born that way but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it. A Jenny When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. But I started acting in plays and I found that it helped me to be more confident. I had to learn to speak in front of people and to be myself. Now I can speak in front of thousands of people and I feel completely at ease. The key is to keep practicing and to not be afraid of failure. You can do anything you set your mind to if you're willing to put in the work. Brennan When I was younger I was very self conscious about my body. But then I started doing yoga and it helped me to feel more grounded and centered. Now I feel comfortable in my own skin and I don't let other people's opinions get to me. The secret is to focus on what you can control and not to worry about what other people think. Confidence comes from within and it's not something you can fake. Cate When I was starting out in my career I was very anxious about making mistakes. But then I realized that mistakes are just part of the learning process and that everyone makes them. Now I take risks and I'm not afraid to try new things. The key is to embrace failure as a part of the journey and to not be afraid to take chances. Taryn When I was younger I was very introverted and I found it hard to talk to people I didn't know. But then I started practicing mindfulness and it helped me to be more present in

B2,"The kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and riversfeeding on fish. Old trees overhang the stream half shading shallow water. Soft greens mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher is small and quick a blur of blue-green as it darts through the trees. It has a bright blue back and wings and a white belly with two white bands across its face. It is a small bird but with a large personality.  Charles James is a wildlife photographer who has spent years studying and photographing the kingfisher. He has a deep appreciation for the bird's beauty and grace, and his photographs capture its essence in stunning detail.

B2,"Studio Audiences What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical difficultiesstudio audiences are just another common feature of television lifeand yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows for example we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? What do they do all day? And how on earth do they manage to stay so cheerful? The answers, it turns out, are surprisingly fascinating. In the first of a series of articles about television studio audiences, Cosmo Landesman set out to find out more. Audience members are often asked to attend a show a few times a week, and in some cases, they are required to attend every day. The pay varies depending on the show, but it's usually around ¬£20 to ¬£30 per day, plus expenses. They are expected to be on time, well-groomed, and prepared to follow any instructions given by the producers. The audience is usually made up of a mix of people from different walks of life, all chosen for their ability to react to what's happening on screen in an authentic and engaging way. They are usually seated in the front row of the studio, with the rest of the audience following their lead. Being in the audience for a television show can be a fun and exciting experience, but it can also be challenging. The audience members must remain completely silent during filming, and they are not allowed to talk to each other or make any noise. They must also be prepared to sit for long periods of time, sometimes for up to 12 hours a day. Despite these challenges, many audience members find being in the studio to be a thr"

'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. And when he turned fifteen he grew another ten centimetres. By the time he was sixteen he was six feet three inches tall - and growing. And that was just the beginning. By the time he was twenty he was over seven feet tall. And as he approached his thirtieth birthday he was a staggering eight feet three inches tall - and still growing. It's a bit of a problem really. He can't fit into most cars - or most houses. He has to duck to avoid hitting his head on the low-hanging branches of trees. And he's had to give up his dream of joining the navy - because they don't have any ships big enough to accommodate him.

B2,"In April 1919 the British rulers in India decided to put down protests in the city of Amritsar. As people gathered in the public garden during the festival of Vaisakhi a British general ordered his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd. As well as thousands of injuries there were hundreds of deaths. The Amritsar Massacre as it became known was a turning point in the struggle for Indian independence.

This event is significant because:
A) It was the start of the non-cooperation movement led by Mahatma Gandhi.
B) It was a turning point in the struggle for Indian independence.
C) It was a response to the Rowlatt Act.
D) It was a result of the partition of India.

The answer is (B) The Amritsar Massacre was a turning point in the struggle for Indian independence. The massacre was a brutal and unnecessary act of violence that shocked the Indian people and galvanized the movement for independence. It marked a shift in the Indian nationalist movement, with many leaders and the public calling for more radical and direct action against British rule. The Amritsar Massacre is considered a turning point in the struggle for Indian independence because it raised awareness of the British government's brutal tactics and galvanized the movement for independence.

The other options are not accurate:

A) The non-cooperation movement led by Mahatma Gandhi started in 1920, a year after the Amritsar Massacre.

B) The Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919, the same year as the Amritsar Massacre. While the Rowlatt Act was"

B2,"What would happen to our planet if humans were to suddenly disappear? This is the basic hypothesis behind Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us. Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear. In one chapter there is an analysis of how New York would survive if there were no humans to take care of it.

The world would begin to return to its natural state.

Plants would start to reclaim the urban landscape.

The skyscrapers would crumble and be overtaken by vegetation.

The streets would fill with trash and debris.

The buildings would start to collapse.

The city would become a jungle.

The World Without Us is a thought-provoking book that explores the idea of what would happen to the Earth if humans were to suddenly disappear. Weisman examines how different ecosystems around the world would react to the loss of humanity, and the surprisingly quick rate at which nature would reclaim the planet.

The book is divided into several chapters, each focusing on a different region of the world. From the abandoned cities of Europe to the forests of North America, Weisman shows how the natural world would respond to the absence of humanity.

The World Without Us is a fascinating and thought-provoking book that challenges readers to consider the impact of human activity on the planet. It is a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that we must take responsibility for the way we treat the Earth.

The book is not just a theoretical exercise, but also a practical guide to how we can live in a more sustainable way. By understanding how the Earth would respond to a world without"

She was dressed in overalls and ugly big shoes and a bush of wiry hair framed her pretty face. Her eyes were dark and dreamy and her lips were full and moist.

""I'm Rita Cohen,"" she said breathlessly. ""I've been watching you for weeks. You're the most interesting man in this dump.""

Seymour was taken aback by her sudden appearance and by her forward manner. He was even more taken aback by her words. He had never thought of himself as an interesting man, and he certainly didn't think of himself as an interesting man in a dump like this.

""What do you want?"" he asked gruffly, trying to hide his surprise.

""I want to talk to you,"" she said, looking at him with an intensity that made him feel uneasy. ""I want to know everything about you.""

Seymour shifted uncomfortably under her gaze. He didn't know what to say to her. He had never been the center of attention before, and he certainly didn't want to be now.

""I don't know much to tell,"" he said, trying to brush her off.

But Rita Cohen wouldn't take no for an answer. She kept talking to him, asking him questions about his life, about his work, about his family. Seymour found himself answering her, despite himself, drawn in by her curious eyes and her infectious enthusiasm"

B2,"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. The following are some ways to help parents and teachers of children with outstanding musical ability: 1. Recognise the signs: The first step is to recognise the signs of exceptional musical ability. This can include a natural interest in music, an ability to pick up musical concepts quickly, a strong desire to play or sing, and an exceptional ability to memorise music. 2. Provide opportunities: Provide opportunities for your child to develop their musical talents. This may include lessons with a professional music teacher, participation in music ensembles, or enrolling them in a specialist music school. 3. Set realistic goals: Set realistic goals for your child's musical development, both short-term and long-term. This will help them stay motivated and focused, and will also help you to assess their progress. 4. Encourage practice: Encourage your child to practice regularly, and to set aside dedicated time each day for music-making. This will help them to develop their skills and to maintain their enthusiasm for music. 5. Be supportive: Be supportive of your child's musical interests and endeavours. This means being available to listen to them, to offer encouragement, and to help them to overcome any challenges they may face. 6.

C1,"We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
It was a drizzly, grey morning when we all gathered at the designated spot. Each of us had been paired with someone else, and we were eager to see who we would be switching lives with.
As we introduced ourselves, I couldn't help but wonder what the day would bring. Would I be a rockstar, or a stay-at-home mom? A billionaire, or a homeless person?
The first pair was a young couple, Emily and Ryan. Emily was a graphic designer, and Ryan was a software engineer. They were both excited to see what it would be like to switch roles for a day.
Next up was Sarah and John, a married couple in their mid-40s. Sarah was a teacher, and John was a lawyer. They were both curious to see what it would be like to be in each other's shoes.
Then there was me, and my partner, Rachel. I was a writer, and Rachel was a nurse. We were both eager to see what it would be like to do each other's jobs for a day.
Finally, there was the last pair, Tom and Lisa. Tom was a photographer, and Lisa was a baker. They were both excited to see what it would be like to switch roles for a day and learn something new.

C1,Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country says Georgina Ferry but she is little known For the past four years I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. The response is almost always a blank look. Who is Dorothy Hodgkin? Why should anyone care? The answer is that Dorothy Hodgkin was a British biochemist who made major contributions to the understanding of insulin and vitamin D and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964. But despite her achievements she remains a mystery to many in her own country. According to the Royal Society which is celebrating its 350th anniversary this year Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize. Her achievements were groundbreaking and her work has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the human body and how it functions. But she is little known in her own country and her achievements have not been fully recognized or celebrated. This is a sad reflection on the state of science in Britain and the way we value and recognize the contributions of women scientists. As a society we need to do more to promote and celebrate the achievements of our scientists particularly those who have made significant contributions to our understanding of the human body and its many mysteries. Georgina Ferry is a science writer and author of the book Dorothy Hodgkin: A Life. She has been researching and writing about Dorothy Hodgkin's life and work for the past four years and has been shocked by the lack of knowledge

C1,"A trumpet isn‚Äôt just for Christmas‚Ä¶ It is strange how many musicians even leading ones come from homes without music. Out of the blue Hakan Hardenberger the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world‚Äôs trumpet-players today. He is a trumpeter of the first order, with a tone that is both powerful and beautiful. The fact that he has risen to such a position without any musical background in his family is all the more remarkable.

Hardenberger was born in 1970 in the small town of Torsby, located in the southern part of Sweden. His parents were not musicians, and he grew up in a household without music. Despite this, Hardenberger showed an early interest in music and began playing the trumpet at the age of 9. He practiced diligently and quickly became a skilled player, eventually earning a place at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm.

After completing his studies, Hardenberger embarked on a successful career as a soloist and chamber musician, performing with many of the world's leading orchestras and ensembles. He has also been recognized with numerous awards and honors, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Music's Gold Medal.

Hardenberger's unique sound and technique have earned him a reputation as one of the most exciting and innovative trumpet players of his generation. Despite his lack of musical background, he has proven that with hard work and dedication, anyone can achieve greatness in the world of music.

What is the main idea of the passage?

C1,"He had said exactly the name Emma wanted him to say. Now she could suggest that it was difficult to explain matters by letter and she offered to go over to Rouen and speak to him directly. Charles would not hear of troubling her. She insisted. It was a battle of kindness. He had given in and agreed to see her in Rouen. 

Now Emma was packing her bags and preparing for the journey. She was nervous but excited. She had never been to Rouen before and was eager to see the city. She was also eager to see Charles and talk to him in person. She wanted to know more about him and his life in Rouen.

As she packed, Emma couldn't help but think about the letter she had received. It was so unexpected and yet, at the same time, it made perfect sense. She had always known that Charles was a kind and caring person, but to hear him say it in his own words was something else entirely.

Emma finished packing and headed to the door, ready to begin her journey. She was excited to see Charles and to learn more about him. She was also a little nervous, but mostly she was just eager to get started.

As she walked out the door, Emma couldn't help but wonder what the future held. She had no idea what would happen when she arrived in Rouen, but she was ready for whatever came her way. She was ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead and to see where this journey would take her.

Emma arrived in Rouen and made her way to Charles's house. She was greeted at the door by Charles himself, who looked a little"

C1,"Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession A The rules for work are changing We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are or by our training and expertise but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other.

C1,"Sound the Alarm Stuart Harris reports Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Here are some things to consider: First of all, you'll want to think about the size of the radio. Some clock radios are quite small and can fit on a bedside table while others are much larger and may require a separate stand or shelf. Next, you'll want to consider the sound quality. Some clock radios have excellent sound quality while others are more tinny or distorted. Think about how important sound quality is to you and look for a radio that meets your needs. You'll also want to think about the features of the radio. Some clock radios come with extra features such as Bluetooth connectivity, built-in chargers for your phone or other devices, or even built-in speakers. Consider what features are important to you and look for a radio that meets your needs. Finally, you'll want to think about the price. Clock radios can range in price from around $50 to over $300, so it's important to set a budget and look for a radio that fits within it. By considering these factors, you can find a clock radio that meets your needs and helps you start your day off right. 3

C1,"With the trees I planted my stake in New Zealand JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER Jonallum Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology'. I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn‚Äôt have any summers. I was living in Wellington, New Zealand, and for two years I didn‚Äôt experience a single warm day. It was like living in a perpetual autumn. I had come to Wellington to take up a position as a professor of politics at Victoria University, but I found myself unable to enjoy the city‚Äôs reputation for outdoor activities like hiking and kayaking. The lack of sunshine was a constant frustration, and I found myself spending more time indoors, reading and writing. As a result, I became more interested in the natural world and its relationship to politics. I started to think about how we need to reconcile our desire for economic growth with the need to protect the environment. I began to see the natural world as a vital part of our political and social fabric, and I started to write about these ideas in my blog. As I was writing, I began to realize that my ideas were not just relevant to New Zealand, but to the global debate about how to balance economic growth with environmental protection. I started to see myself as part of a global conversation about the future of the planet, and I began to think about how I could contribute to that conversation. I started to write more widely, and my blog became a platform for me to share my ideas with a wider audience. I began to speak at conferences and events, and I started to work with organizations that were interested in the same issues. I realized that I"

C1,"P. D. James Barbara Michaels meets the acclaimed crime writer whose innocent exterior hides a complex and brilliant imagination. Best-selling crime writer P.D. James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase as a headmistress of a girls' school. But then, as she smiles wryly, ""I would have been an unspeakable bore."" James, 69, is a rare bird indeed. Her 14 novels, including ""Death in Holy Orders"" and ""The Children of Men,"" have won her a place in the literary firmament alongside Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers. Her work is characterized by complex, intricate plots, a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the human condition. But, unlike some of her contemporaries, she has never lost sight of the importance of style. Her prose is crisp, clear and beautifully crafted, with a precision that belies her gentle demeanor. Her detectives are not the usual bumbling fools or hard-boiled loners of the genre, but rather intelligent, thoughtful and often flawed individuals, struggling to make sense of a world that is increasingly complex and confusing. In her latest novel, ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,"" James takes the reader on a dizzying ride of twists and turns, as her detective, Inspector Adam Dalgliesh, investigates the murder of a wealthy industrialist. The solution to the crime is a masterpiece of misdirection and surprise, and James's skill in keeping the reader guessing is only one of the many reasons why she is regarded as one"

Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‚Äòopen farm‚Äô six years ago we‚Äôve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. We started with just a handful of lambs but have since expanded to include goats, pigs, cows, and even the odd injured bird or two. ‚ÄòWhat now?‚Äô I asked, wondering what new arrival was about to grace our humble abode. ‚ÄòA badger!‚Äô my helper exclaimed, her eyes wide with excitement. And with that, a fluffy little badger cub was placed into my arms. The little creature snuggled up close, nuzzling its head into my chest, and I knew that our lives were about to change forever. Growing up on a farm, I had always been aware of the badgers that lived in the surrounding countryside. These nocturnal creatures were a bit of a mystery to me, and I had always been fascinated by their elusive nature. But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that one would end up in my arms as a tiny, adorable bundle of joy. The badger cub was just a few weeks old when it arrived at our farm, having been found wandering alone in the nearby woods. It was clear that its mother had died, and with no other badgers in the area to care for it, the little creature was at risk of not surviving. So, with no hesitation, we agreed to take the badger in and give it a home. And that‚Äôs how we found"
C1,"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. The Daily Telegraph
Publisher B Reviews are incredibly important. The Guardian
Publisher C Reviews are crucial, especially when it comes to fiction. The Times
Publisher D Reviews can make or break a book. The Independent
Publisher E Reviews are a major factor in the commercial success of a book. Financial Times
But do they? Is it really true that reviews sell books? We decided to test the theory. We took five books, each of which had received high praise from critics, and tracked their sales over a period of six months. The results were surprising.
Publisher A's book: Sales remained steady throughout the six months, but never really took off. Despite the glowing reviews, the book never became a bestseller.
Publisher B's book: Sales increased significantly in the first month after the reviews were published, but then tailed off. The book never reached the top of the bestseller lists.
Publisher C's book: Sales rose steadily throughout the six months, but never reached the heights predicted by the reviews. The book peaked at number 12 on the bestseller list.
Publisher D's book: Sales skyrocketed in the first month after the reviews were published, but then levelled off. The book reached number 5 on the bestseller list.

C1,"WEATHERVANE MAKER THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham‚Äôs designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. He uses a variety of materials including copper, lead and zinc. The process begins with a sketch of the design, which is then transferred onto a metal sheet. The various parts of the weathervane are then cut out using specialist tools and techniques. The pieces are then assembled, and the final touches are added, including the addition of a tail and any other decorative features. The weathervane is then finished with a protective coating and sent off to its new home. The craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into each weathervane are truly remarkable. As Graham says, ‚ÄúThere is a lot of skill and craftsmanship that goes into making a weathervane, and I think that‚Äôs what makes them so special.‚Äù

A weathervane is a device that shows the direction of the wind. It is usually shaped like an animal or object that rotates with the wind, displaying its tail or other features to indicate the direction of the wind. Weathervanes are often mounted on top of buildings, such as churches, barns, and houses, and have been used for centuries to help people determine which way the wind is blowing. The earliest weathervanes were made in Egypt around 3000 BCE, and they were often shaped like animals or gods. The craft of making weathervanes spread throughout the"
C1,"But he most regretted his denials that the industry aimed its advertising at teenagers. ""We spent millions studying kids. We knew that they could name the three most advertised brands of cigarettes. We knew that almost 90 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands. We knew that kids who had been exposed to the most advertising were more likely to smoke. And we did nothing.""

He looked around the room, his eyes searching for someone to blame. ""We were too busy making money to care about the consequences of our actions. We were too busy trying to sell cigarettes to worry about the health of our customers. We were too greedy, too selfish, too stupid.""

He paused, taking a deep breath before continuing. ""But I'm not here to blame others. I'm here to tell the truth. And the truth is that I was part of the problem. I was part of the industry that preyed on the vulnerable and the innocent. And I'm sorry.""

He looked at the crowd, his eyes filled with tears. ""I'm sorry for the lives that were lost. I'm sorry for the suffering that was caused. And I'm sorry for my part in it. I hope that by telling the truth, I can help prevent this from happening again.""

The room was silent, the only sound the rustling of papers as people took notes. It was a powerful admission, one that many in the room had been waiting to hear for years. And as the man finished speaking, there was a sense of relief, a sense that finally, someone was taking responsibility for the actions of the tobacco industry."

I waited in the room for a long time. I tried to read a book but my mind was not in the mood for reading. I kept thinking of what had happened to me that day.

After a while the clerk came in and said Mr Jaggers was coming. I was nervous and my heart was beating fast.

Mr Jaggers came in and greeted me. He was a tall man with a stern face. He asked me to sit down and asked me to tell him everything that had happened from the beginning.

I told him everything, from the moment I saw the strange man in the town to the moment I ran away from him. He listened carefully and asked me several questions.

When I finished he said he would help me. He said he would go to the police and tell them what had happened and that they would find the man who had tried to kidnap me.

I was so relieved and thanked him from the bottom of my heart. Mr Jaggers smiled and said it was his duty to help people like me. He told me that he would do everything he could to make sure I was safe and that I would not have to go through anything like this again.

C1,"THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should combine old and new says Tom Cunliffe. And he put it into practice in his own craft 'The Westerman'. This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. But amid the gleaming carbonfibre and shiny aluminium lies a challenge to the status quo. For some designers and builders are looking back to the past for inspiration. Not to revive the old but to create a new blend of traditional and modern. The boat of my dreams, I find myself musing, should combine the best of both worlds. It's a dream shared by many, judging by the interest in traditional wooden boats at shows like this. But what exactly does it mean to combine old and new? For one thing, it means rejecting the idea that a boat must be a cutting-edge technological marvel. Instead, it should be a thing of beauty with a sense of history and craftsmanship. Take the Westerman, the boat I've been building for the past seven years. It's a 26ft wooden sloop with a traditional hull shape, but it has a modern rig and an open deck layout. The result is a boat that's both timeless and modern. The Westerman has a wooden hull, built using traditional techniques, but the deck and cabin are made of laminated timber and epoxy. This gives the boat a lightweight structure that's strong and durable. The rig is modern, with a retractable carbonfibre mast and a Profurl furling system. The result is a boat that s"

The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards. This behaviour is known as hibernation and it is essential to their survival. Hedgehogs are nocturnal animals and they spend most of their time foraging for food. They eat insects and other small animals as well as fruits and berries. Hedgehogs are solitary animals and they only come together to mate. Males will fight each other for the right to mate with a female. Hedgehogs are important to their ecosystems because they help to control insect populations. They also act as pollinators and seed dispersers. Unfortunately many species of hedgehogs are threatened or endangered due to habitat loss and hunting. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these animals and their habitats. Hedgehogs are fascinating creatures that play a vital role in their ecosystems. Their unique spines and behaviours make them a popular subject of study and admiration.

C1,"Blacksmiths THROUGHOUT the ages iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers because they were the sole providers of weapons armour and farming tools.
Their work was seen as a form of alchemy and their skills were passed down through generations with great secrecy and reverence.
The earliest known blacksmiths date back to the Iron Age around 1200 BC. They worked in small forges heated by bellows and used hammer and anvil to shape iron into tools and weapons.
Over time the art of blacksmithing spread throughout the world and different cultures developed their own unique styles and techniques.
In Europe during the Middle Ages blacksmiths were highly respected and often organized into guilds which protected their interests and maintained standards of quality.
In Japan the art of blacksmithing was elevated to a fine art with the development of the samurai class who prized the strength and beauty of their swords above all else.
In the Americas indigenous peoples were skilled blacksmiths who created tools and weapons from the iron they found in their environment.
Today blacksmiths continue to practice their ancient craft using modern techniques and tools while still honoring the traditions and skills of their ancestors.
Their work is a testament to the enduring power of human creativity and ingenuity and a reminder that some things in life are worth preserving and passing on.

C1,"The Tartan Museum The modern cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened. You cannot miss it. The Tartan Museum, a building of such modern design that it looks as if it was plucked from the pages of a science fiction novel, sits on Edinburgh's Royal Mile like a cheese-wedge in a slice of toast. The outside is a striking contrast to the historic surroundings, with its angular shapes and bright colors. But what about the contents? Would they be just as striking? I stepped inside, eager to find out. The first thing that struck me was the light. The museum is a veritable cathedral of natural light, with walls of glass that let in a flood of sunshine. It's a clever move, as it makes the exhibits seem even more vibrant and alive. The first exhibit I came to was a recreation of a Scottish clan's meeting hall. It was like stepping back in time, with the smell of old wood and the sound of bagpipes filling the air. The artifacts were fascinating, from the intricately carved chairs to the ancient weapons on display. It was clear that the museum's curators had gone to great lengths to create an immersive experience. As I made my way through the galleries, I found myself drawn into the stories of Scotland's people. There were exhibits on everything from the country's ancient myths and legends to its modern-day culture. The museum was"
C1,"In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr Toby Clark a researcher at the British Geological Survey aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. But he was also a pioneering geophysicist who charted compass variations across the globe. Inspired by Halley's work, Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is on a quest to retrace Halley's steps and unravel the mystery of the Earth's magnetic field. Clark is using a combination of historical records and modern technology to track the changes in the Earth's magnetic field over time. He is also studying the effect of solar activity on the field, as well as the impact of human activities such as mining and drilling on the magnetic field. Clark's research has important implications for navigation, communication and the protection of the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in the Earth's core. This movement creates electric currents, which in turn generate the magnetic field. The field is essential for navigation and communication, as it provides a way to determine direction and location. However, the Earth's magnetic field is not constant and has been changing over time. Halley was one of the first scientists to chart these changes, which he did by measuring the compass variations across the globe. Clark is using a combination of historical records and modern technology to track the changes in the Earth's magnetic field over time. He is studying the magnetic field in the same way that Halley did, by"

C1,"Photographing People People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations the photographer has to be conscious of actions gestures and expressions. The subjects must be comfortable and relaxed in front of the camera, and the photographer must be able to capture these fleeting moments of interaction and emotion. The best photographers of people are those who can connect with their subjects and capture their essence in a single shot.

Here are some tips for photographing people:

1. Connect with your subject: Take the time to talk to your subject and get to know them. This will help you understand their personality and capture their essence in the photograph.
2. Be respectful: Remember that your subject is a person, not just a prop. Be respectful of their privacy and personal space, and never try to manipulate or coerce them into doing something they don't want to do.
3. Pay attention to lighting: Lighting is crucial for capturing the mood and atmosphere of a photograph. Use natural light or artificial light to create the desired effect.
4. Focus on the eyes: The eyes are the windows to the soul, so make sure to focus on them in your photograph. This will help to convey the subject's emotions and personality.
5. Capture candid moments: Candid moments are often the most revealing and natural-looking. Try to capture your subject in a moment of unawareness, such as when they are smiling or laughing.
6. Experiment with composition: Don't be"

One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. ""I'll have a room with a view, please,"" says the guest, a tall, slender man with a mischievous glint in his eye. The receptionist, a plump woman with a bored expression, barely glances up from the computer screen in front of her. ""Sorry, sir, but we're fully booked for the next two weeks,"" she informs him in a tone that suggests she'd rather be anywhere else. ""Perhaps you could try the Travelodge down the road?"" The guest pauses, seemingly considering this option for a moment before asking, ""Do you have any rooms with a view of the sea?"" The receptionist sighs and rolls her eyes. ""Sir, we're in the middle of a city. Our rooms don't have views of the sea."" The guest chuckles and says, ""Ah, I see. Well, in that case, I'll just have to take my business elsewhere."" He hangs up the phone and walks away, leaving the receptionist looking flustered and frustrated. As the annual inspection continues, it becomes clear that the Globe Hotel is in for a rough ride. The decor is outdated and the beds are uncomfortable. The breakfast buffet is meager and the service is slow and inattentive. It's a wonder any guests ever stay here"
C1,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to reveal a person‚Äôs character is gaining support If you applied for a job in some countries you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting as much as anything else that would determine your suitability for the job. In the UK, for example, the Civil Service has long used handwriting analysis as part of its recruitment process. And in the US, some employers still use handwriting analysis as a way to assess job candidates. But handwriting analysis is not just limited to employment. Psychologists have long been fascinated by the relationship between handwriting and personality. In fact, the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, was an early advocate of handwriting analysis. He believed that the way a person wrote revealed their unconscious thoughts and desires. And modern psychologists continue to study the connection between handwriting and personality, using it to gain insights into a person‚Äôs emotional and psychological makeup. So what can handwriting analysis reveal about a person‚Äôs character? Well, it can reveal a person‚Äôs level of self-esteem, their emotional stability, their creativity, their intelligence, their social skills, their level of anxiety, and even their sexual preference. All of these things can be inferred from the way a person writes. And the more detailed and legible the handwriting is, the more accurate the analysis is likely to be. But it‚Äôs important to remember that handwriting analysis is not an exact science. It‚Äôs a complex and multi-faceted process, and the results should always be interpreted with caution. The relationship between handwriting"
C1,"Volunteer tourism Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. A. It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. B. The potential benefits to the volunteers themselves are far more significant than to the communities they are supposed to be helping. C. The potential benefits to the volunteers themselves are far more significant than to the communities they are supposed to be helping. D. Volunteer tourism can be a valuable tool for promoting cultural exchange and understanding between different countries.

A. It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly.

Volunteer tourism, while intended to promote development in developing countries, often fails to deliver tangible results. This is because the short-term nature of these programs means that the work produced is often of a low quality or does not last long after the volunteers have left. Furthermore, the focus on the volunteers' personal experiences and the perceived cultural exchange between the volunteers and the local communities can detract from the actual needs of the community. Therefore, while volunteer tourism may provide some benefits to the volunteers themselves, it is hard to argue that it makes a significant contribution to development.

B. The potential benefits to the volunteers themselves are far more significant than to the communities they are supposed to be helping.

While the communities that host volunteer tourists may not directly benefit from these programs, the volunteers themselves can gain a great deal. Volunteering in a developing country can provide a unique opportunity for personal growth and development, as well as a"
C1,"A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
B. The Collection The collection covers a wide range of subjects and styles from the 5th century BCE to the 4th century CE. The collection includes sculptures from the Parthenon frieze, the Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace, to name a few. The casts are remarkably detailed and faithful to the originals, making them an invaluable resource for studying the art and craftsmanship of ancient Greece and Rome.
C. The History of the Collection The collection was formed by Sir William Hamilton, a British diplomat and archaeologist, who began his collection in the early 19th century. He amassed a vast collection of Greek and Roman sculptures, many of which he excavated himself. After his death, his collection was bequeathed to the University of Oxford, where it has remained ever since. Over the years, the collection has been expanded through purchases and gifts, and it now stands as one of the most important collections of its kind in the world.
D. The Significance of the Collection The collection is significant not only for its historical value but also for its educational importance. The casts provide a tangible link to the past, allowing visitors to study the intricate details of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture up close. The collection has also been used extensively by scholars and researchers, providing a valuable resource"
C1,"Are you too nice for your own good? When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity. 'I'm so sorry' I beamed when I dropped the plate on the floor and it smashed into smithereens. 'Oh no worries, darling! It's not your fault at all!'. I was so desperate to be liked and to avoid any kind of conflict that I would have smiled if someone had told me I was wearing my trousers inside out.

But as I got older and gained more experience in the workplace, I began to realise that being too nice can actually hold you back. It can make you appear weak and unconfident, and it can also make it harder for people to take you seriously. So I started to tone down my smiling and to speak up more when I needed to.

It's not that I'm not a nice person anymore, but I've learned that being nice doesn't mean being a pushover. I still smile when I can, but I'm also more assertive and more willing to stand up for myself and my colleagues. And you know what? It's actually made me more popular in the workplace. People respect me more when I'm confident and assertive, and they appreciate my willingness to speak up when something needs to be done.

So if you're too nice for your own good, take a page out of my book and start standing up for yourself. You don't have to be mean or aggressive, but it's okay to be assertive and to set boundaries. Trust me, it will make you"
C1,"Science flying in the face of gravity Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964 a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. But as they climbed higher and higher, something strange started to happen. The students, all of them science enthusiasts, felt themselves becoming lighter and lighter until they were floating around the aircraft like astronauts in space. It was the first time anyone had experienced weightlessness in a flying aircraft. The KC-135 had been modified to create a zero-gravity environment for experiments and tests, and the students were part of a program called the Zero Gravity Research Flight Program. The program was designed to give students the opportunity to conduct experiments in weightlessness, and to learn about the effects of microgravity on living organisms, materials, and the human body. The students, who were all aged between 12 and 14, were divided into teams and given a range of experiments to carry out during the flight. They included growing crystals, testing the effects of microgravity on plant growth, and studying the behavior of fluids in weightlessness. The students were also given a special spacesuit to wear during the flight, which allowed them to move around freely in the zero-gravity environment. The flight was a huge success, and the students returned to Earth with a newfound appreciation of the wonders of weightlessness. The experience had been both exhilarating and challenging, but above all it had been an incredible learning experience. As they looked back on their time on the KC-13"

Even seen at a distance eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an I8-year-old student filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. One day I found myself in Cannes harbour and spotted a figure sitting at a table outside a restaurant. As I got closer I realised it was Pablo Picasso himself. I was stunned. I had always been fascinated by Picasso's work and here was the man himself eating his lunch in the sun. I hesitated for a moment before approaching him. 'Good afternoon Mr Picasso' I stammered. 'Ah good afternoon young man' he replied with a smile. 'How are you enjoying Cannes?' I explained that I was just passing through and was amazed to be in the presence of such a legendary artist. 'Ah well' Picasso said 'Cannes is a very pleasant place to spend some time. The climate is excellent and the people are friendly. I come here whenever I can'. I was in awe of the great man and struggled to think of anything else to say. 'I'm a great admirer of your work Mr Picasso' I managed to stammer. 'Ah yes' he replied with a twinkle in his eye 'I'm glad to hear that. I hope you're enjoying my paintings' I nodded eagerly and Picasso continued 'I'm glad to see that young people are still interested in art. It's important to keep the passion alive'.

Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. The world has changed beyond recognition since advertising was invented in the early 20th century. Back then there were new technologies to be exploited - radio, television and computers - and new mass media to advertise in. But today there are new technologies - the internet and mobile phones - and new ways of communicating that advertisers are struggling to understand and harness. Advertising has become too expensive and too intrusive. People are turning off their televisions and radios and ignoring billboards. They are using ad-blocking software to avoid online ads. They are even boycotting brands that they feel are too pushy or exploitative. Advertisers are trying to find new ways to reach consumers but they are running into a brick wall of resistance. The public is angry about the intrusion of advertising into their private lives and the way it manipulates them with false promises. The advertising industry is also facing a crisis of confidence. Advertisers are questioning whether the traditional methods of advertising work any more. They are looking for new ways to reach consumers that are more subtle and more respectful of their privacy. There are new forms of advertising emerging such as viral marketing and guerrilla marketing that are more creative and more effective than traditional methods. But the industry is still struggling to find a new way to reach consumers that is both"

Georgina McGuinness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. Her home, once a place of relaxation and leisure, had become a disorganized and cluttered space that made it difficult for her to focus on her work.
But McGuinness was determined to turn things around. She decided to transform her home into an efficient workplace, where she could work comfortably and productively.
First, she tackled the clutter. She cleared out old newspapers, dusty books, and unused kitchen gadgets, creating a more streamlined and organized living space. She then set up a dedicated workspace, complete with a desk, chair, and good lighting.
Next, she invested in some technology to help her stay connected and productive. McGuinness purchased a reliable laptop and a comfortable headset, which allowed her to make phone calls and participate in video conferences without any interruptions. She also set up a wireless printer and scanner, which made it easy to print and scan documents on the go.

They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? The peacocks' fans flame out in the heat, like a woman on a summer's day, and the hens - who are, after all, the true rulers of this kingdom - look on with a mixture of contempt and awe. They know that the peacocks are the true aristocrats of this place, and that their beauty is a weapon, a challenge to the rest of the world to keep up with them.

C1,"NATURAL TALENTS In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees we haven‚Äôt had time to develop any differences: genetically we‚Äôre still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps. On this grand evolutionary scale whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. The idea that humans have a natural talent for anything is therefore a bit of a myth. Our talents are largely the result of cultural and social learning rather than any innate differences from other species.

For example:

* Music: we have no natural talent for music. It‚Äôs a learned skill that requires years of practice and training.
* Language: our ability to communicate with language is not a natural talent but a learned skill. Babies are born without the ability to speak and must learn language through exposure and social interaction.
* Art: we have no natural talent for art. Artists are not born with an innate ability to create beautiful works of art but rather develop their skills through practice and training.

In short we have no natural talents. What we take for granted as innate abilities are actually the result of cultural and social learning.

The idea that humans have natural talents is a myth that has been perpetuated throughout history. From ancient Greece to modern times this belief has been used to justify social inequality and to support the idea that some people are inherently more talented than others.

In reality our talents are largely the result of cultural and social learning rather than any innate differences from other species. This means that anyone can develop their talents regardless of their background or genetic makeup.

His latest film was tanking at the box office and his marriage was on the rocks. He was feeling dejected and disillusioned with his career when he had an epiphany. I was walking through the fields near my home in Wales with my dog when I suddenly had the most vivid dream, he recalls. I saw a horse galloping across the landscape and a young girl was riding it.

The story of Tamburlaine‚Äôs rise from shepherd to emperor is told in a series of frenetic, often hilarious set pieces, with the cast of 17 actors leaping, rolling and somersaulting around the stage. The production is a visual and theatrical feast, with a stunning design by Tim Hatley that incorporates projections, lighting and a giant rotating globe.
The play is a classic tale of ambition and power, but it‚Äôs also a riotous satire of the excesses of the Elizabethan age. Marlowe‚Äôs language is rich and poetic, and the cast deliver their lines with a fierce passion that makes the play feel alive and dangerous.
There are some memorable performances, notably from Joseph Mykell as Tamburlaine and his arch-enemy, the Grand Turk (played by Paul Chahidi). The chemistry between the two actors is electric, and their scenes crackle with tension and energy.

But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless that is it is newspapers‚Äô ‚Äòtransition‚Äô to the online world an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process ‚Äì because frankly it may not be a process at all. For the past week or so, I have been mulling over the fate of the newspaper business. And I have come to the conclusion that the end of print may take some time.

For a start, there are still plenty of people who read newspapers every day. Sure, the circulations are down, but there are still millions of people who rely on newspapers for their news and information. And even if the circulations continue to fall, there will still be a market for newspapers ‚Äì especially for those who prefer to read their news on paper rather than on a screen.

But beyond that, there are other factors at play here. Newspapers have a long and storied history, and they have played a vital role in shaping the way we think about the world around us. They have provided a platform for journalists to report on important issues, and they have given voice to marginalized communities. And even if the print edition of a newspaper is no longer the dominant form of news delivery, that doesn‚Äôt mean that the role of newspapers in society is over.

In fact, the transition to online news may actually give newspapers a new lease on life.

And with the rise of social media, newspapers can now reach a new generation of readers who may not"

C1,"The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. But as we talk, it becomes clear that Hurst is a man of many facets. He is a skilled craftsman who has spent decades honing his trade, but he is also a designer, an entrepreneur, a husband and father. He is passionate about his work, and his enthusiasm is infectious. Hurst's day job is running his own furniture-making business, which he started in the early 1990s. He has a small team of skilled craftsmen who work alongside him, and they produce a range of beautiful pieces, from chairs and tables to beds and cupboards. His designs are characterised by clean lines, simple shapes and a careful attention to detail. 'I'm not a fan of clutter,' he says. 'I like things to be simple and elegant. I think that's what makes good design.' Hurst's work is highly sought after by discerning clients, and he has won several awards for his craftsmanship. But he is also a man of the people. He runs a workshop where he teaches people of all ages how to make furniture, and he is passionate about passing on his skills to the next generation. 'I think it's important to keep traditional crafts alive,' he says. 'There's something very special about making something with your own hands.' Hurst's own journey"

The second is the extraordinary house that stands next to it, a modernist masterpiece of sustainable design.
Southwell Minster is a place of great beauty, where the light pours through the stained glass and the stonework glows with a soft, golden light. It is also a place of great history, where the walls are lined with memories of centuries past. But it is not just the Minster that makes this place special. Next door, hidden away from the bustling streets of Southwell, is a modernist masterpiece of sustainable design.
The house, known as Southwell Eco-House, is a testament to the power of innovation and creativity in creating a more sustainable future. It is a place of surprises, where every corner reveals a new wonder. From the living roof, covered in wildflowers and herbs, to the rainwater harvesting system, which collects and stores water for use in the house.
As you step inside, you are greeted by the warmth of the solar-powered heating system, which provides hot water and heating throughout the house. The walls are made of natural materials, such as straw bales and recycled materials, which provide excellent insulation and keep the house warm and cozy.

C1,"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West? Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism massage diet manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions but acupuncture‚Äôs role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West.
Acupuncture involves the use of fine needles that are inserted into specific points on the body. It is based on the belief that there are channels or pathways in the body through which the life energy or Qi flows. When these channels become blocked or imbalanced the body‚Äôs health can suffer. Acupuncture is thought to restore balance to the body by stimulating these channels and allowing the flow of Qi to resume.
Acupuncture is a relatively safe procedure when performed by a licensed practitioner. However there are some risks associated with it including infection and injury from the needles. Additionally some people may experience side effects such as bleeding or bruising at the site where the needles are inserted. It is important to discuss any concerns or potential risks with a licensed acupuncturist before undergoing treatment.
Acupuncture is used to treat a wide range of conditions including chronic pain migraines and headaches arthritis and fibromyalgia. It is also used to help manage addiction and to improve overall health and well being. While the evidence supporting acupuncture‚Äôs effectiveness is mixed some studies suggest that it may be helpful in managing certain conditions. It is important to talk to a healthcare provider before undergoing acupuncture to determine if it is right for you.
In conclusion acupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical practice"

An art student of 31 devotee of historical romances she seeks Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances.
In this witty and engaging novel, Isabel‚Äôs search for love takes her from the slums of South America to the salons of Paris, via the back streets of London. Along the way, she encounters a cast of eccentric characters, including a dyspeptic Frenchman, a flamboyant transsexual and a sinister-looking man with a penchant for knitting.
Throughout, Isabel remains a charming and endearing heroine, whose determination to find true love never wavers, even when her quest takes some unexpected turns.
As the title suggests, this is a novel about love and relationships, but it is also about the search for identity and the quest for happiness. And it is a search that will keep readers smiling and entertained until the very end.
I must say that I found this book to be quite delightful. It's a lighthearted and humorous tale that had me chuckling throughout. Isabel is a charming and endearing protagonist, and I found myself rooting for her throughout her journey. The supporting characters are also well-drawn and add to the humor and charm of the story.

C1,"Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. Here are three theories: 1. Restoration Theory: According to this theory, sleep is a time of restoration for our bodies. During sleep, our bodies are able to repair and regenerate tissues, build bone and muscle, and strengthen our immune systems. 2. Energy Conservation Theory: This theory suggests that sleep is a way for our bodies to conserve energy. When we are awake, our bodies use a significant amount of energy to maintain basic functions such as breathing, digestion, and circulation. Sleep allows us to conserve this energy and use it more efficiently during the day. 3. Brain Processing and Consolidation Theory: This theory proposes that sleep plays an important role in the processing and consolidation of memories and learning. During sleep, our brains are able to sort through and file away memories, and to solidify new learning and knowledge. In addition, sleep may also help us to better process and understand emotions, and to regulate our emotional responses. In conclusion, while we still have much to learn about the function of sleep, these three theories offer some insight into the many ways in which sleep is essential for our overall health and well-being. By understanding the role that sleep plays in our lives, we can better appreciate the importance of getting enough sleep each night. References: 1. National Sleep Foundation. (2015). S"
C1,"Is your office working ok? Fresh air and the right chairs are the key to a happy healthy workforce according to a new survey. We went to four contrasting offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist who studies people‚Äôs working conditions; and an occupational psychologist.
We found that the four offices we visited had very different approaches to creating healthy working environments. Some had invested in high-tech air purification systems, while others had prioritized natural light and greenery. One office had a gym and meditation room, while another had a games room and a beer fridge.
The survey found that the most important factors in creating a happy and healthy workplace were:
1. Fresh air and ventilation: 80% of respondents said this was important.
2. Ergonomic chairs: 75% said these were essential.
3. Access to natural light: 70% said this was important.
4. Adequate break areas: 65% said these were essential.
5. A supportive work culture: 60% said this was important.

C1,"From here to paternity A. The theatre director Because of my bizarre personal life which I cannot be proud of I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about.

Answer:
The theatre director's response to being asked how he feels about being a father is a humorous and lighthearted one. He jokingly refers to his personal life as ""bizarre"" and states that he has been ""blessed"" with 35 years of small children. He then emphasizes the joys of fatherhood by stating that he loved every minute of it, including feeding the baby this morning. The director's tone is playful and affectionate, conveying a sense of pride and contentment in his role as a father.

The use of the word ""blessed"" is significant in this context, as it implies that the director views his experience of fatherhood as a positive and fortunate one. The phrase ""every minute"" also highlights the director's enthusiasm and dedication to his role, suggesting that he has embraced fatherhood wholeheartedly. Finally, the mention of feeding the baby this morning serves as a poignant reminder of the director's connection to his children and his role as their caregiver. Overall, the director's response is a heartwarming and humorous celebration of the joys of fatherhood.

But I was smiling, feeling proud and relieved, and I didn‚Äôt really care.

That was 1994. It‚Äôs now 2018 and I‚Äôm still a non-smoker. It‚Äôs been 24 years and counting. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs been easy. I‚Äôve had the occasional urge, the odd craving, the temptation to light up. But I‚Äôve always been able to resist, thanks to a combination of willpower, support from friends and family, and the knowledge that I‚Äôve already come so far.

It‚Äôs amazing how quickly you can get used to something. Smoking was a part of my daily routine, something I did without thinking. Waking up in the morning, having a cigarette while I got dressed, taking a break at work to smoke, smoking after dinner, before bed. It was like breathing. And then, suddenly, it wasn‚Äôt.

Of course, I miss it sometimes. I miss the ritual of lighting up, the taste of the smoke, the way it made me feel. But I don‚Äôt miss the smell, the stains on my fingers and clothes, the constant coughing, the worry about my health. And I certainly don‚Äôt miss the way it affected my relationships with others.

C2,"Writing by hand and on screen Dr Johnson maintained that ‚Äòwhat is written without effort is in general read without pleasure‚Äô. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over.
Johnson was a pioneer of the handwritten essay and in his view the process of writing by hand was essential to the quality of the writing. He believed that writing by hand required more effort and concentration than writing on a keyboard, and that this effort and concentration resulted in better writing.
He also believed that writing by hand helped to cultivate a more intimate and personal connection between the writer and the words they were writing.
In contrast, writing on a keyboard allows for greater speed and ease of composition, but it can also lead to a more impersonal and generic style of writing.
Johnson‚Äôs views on the importance of handwriting are particularly relevant in today‚Äôs digital age, where many people are increasingly reliant on technology for their writing. With the rise of email, text messaging, and social media, the handwritten letter has become a rare and precious thing.
However, Johnson‚Äôs views on the importance of handwriting are not just nostalgic or historical. They speak to something deeper and more fundamental about the nature of writing itself.
Writing is a fundamentally human activity, and it involves a complex interplay between the mind, the hand, and the page.
The hand is an essential part of the writing process, and it plays a crucial role in shaping the writer‚Äôs thoughts and ideas into language.

C2,"Philadelphia Avenue I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened the humidity thickened into a palpable prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. I had the street to myself, but the buildings seemed to loom over me, their facades as blank as the backs of strangers. The avenue's architecture was a mix of old and new, with some buildings bearing the weight of age and others gleaming with a fresh coat of paint. I passed a few shops and restaurants, but they seemed to be holding their breath, waiting for something to happen. As I walked, I felt the city's pulse beating in time with my steps, a steady rhythm that matched the drip of the rain on my umbrella. The sound was both comforting and unnerving, like the steady hum of a machine that I couldn't quite identify. I had no destination in mind, just the need to move, to put one foot in front of the other and keep going. As I walked, I tried to shake off the feeling of being lost, of being a small and insignificant speck in a city of millions. But the more I tried to shake it off, the more it seemed to cling to me like a bad habit. I walked faster, my eyes fixed on the next landmark, the next turn in the road. But even as I rushed forward, the feeling of disorientation remained, a constant companion that I couldn't shake. I walked until my legs ached and my shoes were soaked through, until the"
C2,"Einstein Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist and the chances are they‚Äôll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias. He is the go-to figure for anyone wanting to illustrate the power of human intelligence. But, as David Bodanis points out in his book, ""Einstein: A Life in Science"", this is a very partial view of the man and his achievements.

Einstein was not just a scientist, but a passionate advocate for social justice. He was a strong supporter of the civil rights movement in the United States and was involved in various other political causes. He was also a gifted writer and musician, with a love of poetry and the arts.

Einstein's most famous equation, E=mc¬≤, is often seen as the ultimate symbol of his brilliance, but it was only one part of his work. His theories on relativity, quantum mechanics and the nature of space and time are some of the most important scientific discoveries of the 20th century.

Despite his many accomplishments, Einstein was a humble man who never sought to draw attention to himself. He was known for his kindness and generosity, and his love of simple pleasures like sailing and playing the violin.

In ""Einstein: A Life in Science"", David Bodanis paints a vivid and compelling portrait of a man who was both a brilliant scientist and a complex human being. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in"
C2,"Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues.

The number of books on astronomy has increased enormously, and many of them are well-written and well-illustrated. The situation is not ideal, however.

C2,"Fashion Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point. From this perspective, fashion is a relatively recent development, emerging as a result of the growth of capitalism and the rise of a consumer culture. This view is certainly correct in the sense that the modern fashion industry is a product of the capitalist system and the rise of mass production and mass marketing. However, it is also true that the desire for stylish clothing and adornment has been present in human societies for thousands of years. The history of fashion is thus a complex and multifaceted one, encompassing both the economic and social factors that have shaped the industry and the aesthetic and cultural values that have influenced the development of style.

C2,"Metals It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. The pebble may have been a piece of pyrite or some other mineral that shone like gold in the sunlight. Perhaps the early man was fascinated by the pebble and decided to test its properties. He might have discovered that the pebble could be shaped and molded into various forms, that it could be hammered into thin sheets, and that it could be alloyed with other minerals to create different colors and properties. He may have realized that the pebble had a certain strength and durability and that it could be used to create tools and weapons. The discovery of metals would have been a turning point in the history of human civilization. It would have marked the beginning of a new era of innovation and technological advancement. With the discovery of metals, people would have been able to create more sophisticated tools and weapons, and to build more durable shelters and structures. They would have been able to trade and exchange goods more easily, leading to the development of complex societies and economies. The discovery of metals would have also led to the development of new technologies, such as smelting and alloying, which would have allowed people to create a wide range of metal objects, from jewelry and decorative items to agricultural implements and machines. In short, the discovery of metals would have had a profound impact on the course"

The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. I had been to Vienna before, but this time I was there to stay. I was working on a project that would take me to different cities around the world, photographing the way people lived. Vienna was to be the first stop on my journey. I had been there for a week already and I was beginning to feel a sense of familiarity with the city. I had gotten to know the streets and the buildings, the cafes and the shops. I had even made a few friends. But I had yet to find the kind of subject matter I was looking for. I was starting to feel frustrated. I had been so excited about this project when I started, but now I was beginning to wonder if it was all worth it. As I walked through the city, I found myself drawn to a small park in the center of town. It was a beautiful place, with tall trees and a small pond. I sat down on a bench and took out my camera. I began to take photographs of the park, but I was disappointed with the results. They were too formulaic, too obvious. I wanted to find something more interesting, something that would reveal the real spirit of the city. As I was getting up to leave, I noticed a man sitting on a bench across from me.

C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day.

As he hung up his hat in the rack near the door and put his coat away in the closet he felt the hall's familiar embrace. It was a small house, but it was his own, and he had made it so with his own hands. He had painted the walls a warm cream color, and had covered the windowsills with greenery, and had made the old furniture his own with cushions and covers in bright colors.

Ralph had bought the house three years ago, when he had first moved to the city. He had been a young man then, eager to make his way in the world, and the house had seemed the perfect place to start. It was small and cozy, and it had a garden at the back that he could tend. He had worked hard to make the house his own, and it had become his sanctuary, a place where he could retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city and be himself.

As he stood in the hall, Ralph felt a sense of contentment wash over him. He was home, and everything was as it should be.

The room was dark, but he could make out the shapes of the furniture, and he could feel the warmth of the fire that was still burning in the grate"
C2,"Heritage The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously we feel connected to our personal heritage usually we know who and what our grandparents were and we will have heard stories about how they lived. But heritage is more than just our family history. It is also the customs, traditions, values and beliefs that have been passed down from generation to generation within a community or society.
It is the collective memories and experiences of a group of people which shape their identity and sense of belonging.
Heritage is important for several reasons:
It helps us understand our past and how it has shaped our present.
It provides a sense of continuity and stability in a rapidly changing world.
It fosters a sense of identity and belonging, which is essential for individual and community well-being.
It helps us to appreciate and respect cultural diversity and the differences that make us unique.
It provides a shared sense of history and culture, which can help to bring people together and promote social cohesion.
It is a source of pride and inspiration, and can help to motivate people to work towards a better future.
Heritage is not just about preserving old buildings and historical artifacts, it is about preserving the memories, traditions and values of our ancestors, which are the foundation of our identity and sense of belonging.
It is important to preserve our heritage for future generations, so they can learn about and appreciate their cultural and historical roots.
Heritage is a living and dynamic concept, it is not just a collection of old buildings and artifacts, but a living part of our communities"
C2,"Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare‚Äôs play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I was wrong to question his age and I now have the opportunity to make a full apology. Fearon was outstanding as Othello, bringing a freshness and intensity to the role that I have not seen before. His performance was so compelling that I found myself forgetting that I was watching a well-known actor on stage. He was able to convey the vulnerability and insecurity that underpins Othello‚Äôs jealousy and rage, and his delivery of the famous ‚ÄúO, beware, my lord, of jealousy!‚Äù speech was one of the most powerful moments in the play. His Othello was not a one-dimensional villain but a fully rounded character with all the complexities of Shakespeare‚Äôs creation. The supporting cast was also excellent, particularly Hugh Quarshie as Iago and Indira Varma as Desdemona. Quarshie‚Äôs Iago was a masterpiece of acting, a perfectly calibrated performance that made the character‚Äôs duplicity and malevolence all the more chilling. Varma was a sweet and gentle Desdemona, whose tragic fate was all the more heartbreaking because of her innocence and purity. The production was directed by Gregory Dorrill, who kept the action moving at a fast pace and found innovative ways to stage the play‚Äôs famous scenes, such as the handkerchief that Othello uses"
C2,"The Wrong Country Uncle chose for them a package holiday at a very reasonable price: a flight from Gatwick Airport twelve nights in Venice the fairyland city in the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went together to the travel agency to make the booking the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast all of them learning Italian.
Keith and Dawne were not impressed. They had their own reasons for wanting to go to Venice and they did not want to be surrounded by a group of noisy teenagers all speaking in a language they could not understand. The clerk noticed their hesitation and quickly added: ""But don't worry, signori, the school group will be in a separate part of the hotel and you will have your own privacy.""
Keith and Dawne were reassured and booked their holiday. But on the day of their departure they were nervous. They had never been on a package holiday before and were not sure what to expect. As they boarded the plane they were relieved to find themselves surrounded by other adults. They settled into their seats and prepared for take-off.
The flight was long but uneventful and Keith and Dawne were happy to reach Venice airport. They collected their luggage and made their way to the hotel. As they entered the hotel lobby they were greeted by a cheerful receptionist who showed them to the desk where they collected their room keys.
Their room was small but comfortable and they were pleased to find that it was located on the first floor overlooking a quiet side street. They dropped their bags and set out to explore the city.
The first thing they noticed was the water. Venice was built on a series of"
C2,"Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal.

But the reality is far more complex. Lion social dynamics are not always as harmonious as they seem. In fact while lions do hunt together they often engage in fierce territorial battles and occasionally even turn on each other to protect their prides.

This complex social structure is one of the reasons why lions are so fascinating to study. Researchers can learn a great deal about their behavior by observing how they interact with each other and how they manage to cooperate despite their natural inclination towards aggression.

For example a study published in the journal Science found that lions will sometimes go without food for days rather than risk upsetting the balance of their pride. This is particularly interesting given that lions are not typically known for their selfless nature.

In conclusion while the image of lions hunting together may be a compelling one it is important to remember that their social dynamics are far more complex and nuanced than they may seem at first glance. By studying these dynamics researchers can gain valuable insights into the behavior of these magnificent creatures and help to protect them for future generations.

In addition to their complex social dynamics lions also present a number of interesting behavioral phenomena. One of these is the so-called ""stalking"" behavior which involves lions slowly approaching their prey with a deliberate and stealthy gait. This behavior is thought to be"
C2,"Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito‚Äôs plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. Tito has already announced the names of six people who have made it to the final round of selection, but the identity of the couple remains a closely guarded secret.
During their journey, the couple will be required to perform various scientific experiments, including studying the effects of zero gravity on the human body, the behavior of cosmic rays and the Martian atmosphere. They will also have to deal with psychological challenges such as isolation and confinement, as well as the sheer physical strain of being cooped up in a cramped spacecraft for several months.
The couple will be trained at NASA‚Äôs Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where they will learn how to operate the spacecraft‚Äôs systems and how to deal with emergencies. They will also be required to undergo rigorous physical and psychological testing to ensure that they are fit for the mission.
Tito‚Äôs plan is to launch the spacecraft on a Russian Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The spacecraft will be capable of carrying a crew of six, but Tito has decided to limit the number of passengers to four for this first mission in order to minimize the risks involved.
The mission will cost Tito an estimated $200 million, which he plans to fund himself. He hopes to make the mission a regular occurrence, with new couples taking over the spacecraft"
C2,"Garbage in garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be. Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip. In some parts of the world the rubbish is compacted and sent to landfill sites; in others it is burned. But however it is disposed of, the idea that each household should be responsible for its own waste is gaining ground. In some countries, such as Denmark and Sweden, households are already charged for every bag of rubbish they produce. The principle is simple: the more rubbish a family produces, the more it should pay. The Danish government has set up a system of ""refuse taxes"", under which each household is charged a small sum for each bag of rubbish it produces. The tax is based on the weight of the rubbish, and the amount paid increases as the weight of the rubbish rises. The Swedish government has introduced a similar system, known as ""producer responsibility"". Here, too, the amount paid increases with the weight of the rubbish. The idea behind these schemes is that by making households pay for the disposal of their rubbish, they will be more inclined to reduce the amount they produce in the first place. The argument goes that if households had to pay for every bag of rubbish they produced, they would be more likely to recycle, compost and reduce their overall consumption of disposable products. And the more a household reduces its waste, the less it will have to pay in refuse taxes or producer responsibility charges. The environmental benefits"
C2,"Goat Racing I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans hordes of people food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. I had my camera at the ready and my eyes scanning the crowd for the perfect shot.

As I approached the track I could hear the sound of goats bleating and the crowd cheering. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Goats racing? It was like something out of a cartoon. But as I watched the race unfold, I realized that it was no joke. These goats were fast, agile and determined to win.

I managed to get a prime spot right next to the finish line, and as the race began, I was in awe. The goats thundered down the track, their little legs pumping as they chased each other. The crowd was on its feet, cheering and waving their hats. It was a scene straight out of a Caribbean carnival.

As the race neared its end, I could feel the tension building. The goats were neck and neck, their little noses practically touching as they sprinted towards the finish line. And then, in a burst of speed, one of the goats crossed the line, leaving the other in the dust. The crowd erupted into cheers and applause as the winner was declared.

As I watched the goats being led back to their stalls, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at this unique and quirky tradition"
C2,"0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone‚Äôs testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. The interviewer may introduce their own biases, and the interviewee may be influenced by their relationship with the interviewer.
The oral history interview is a conversation between two people, and as such, it is shaped by the dynamics of that relationship. The interviewer‚Äôs tone of voice, body language, and choice of words can all affect the way the interviewee responds. Even the most skilled interviewer can inadvertently introduce their own biases into the interview.
Moreover, the process of oral history is not always reliable. Memories can fade, and people can misremember or embellish events. It is also possible for interviewees to intentionally mislead or deceive the interviewer. In some cases, interviewees may be motivated by a desire to please the interviewer or to promote their own interests rather than to provide an accurate account of the past.
In addition, the oral history method can be limited by the fact that it relies on the memory of a single informant. This can lead to a lack of diversity in the perspectives and experiences that are represented in the historical record. It can also result in a narrow or biased view of the past, as the interviewer may be more likely to select informants who share their own perspectives or who are likely to provide the most sensational or provocative information.

Lancelot smiled wryly to himself and shook his head. He did take sugar, but he wasn't about to tell her that. It was one of the small pleasures of being a vampire - being able to enjoy the taste of coffee without having to worry about the consequences. He had been drinking it for years, ever since he had been turned, and he had long since learned to appreciate the subtle differences in flavor that came with each new batch of coffee beans.

'Of course not,' he said, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible. 'I don't take sugar. I'm not really much of a coffee drinker, to be honest.'

His secretary looked at him skeptically, but he could tell she didn't entirely believe him. She knew him too well. Still, he was grateful for her discretion. It was one of the things he liked about working with her - she was always so careful not to pry.

As he drank his coffee, Lancelot couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He had been drinking this very same coffee for years now, ever since he had first been turned. It was a small comfort, a small pleasure that he had been able to hold onto even as the world around him changed. And as he sat there, sipping his coffee"

The van said Susan noticed ‚ÄòRemovers of Distinction‚Äô and indeed every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables and his team of helpers not so gentle. The family home had seen generations of memories created and now was being taken away. Susan‚Äôs heart raced as she looked at the empty rooms. It was like a body without a soul. She had no choice but to move on. The house was too big for her now and she was tired of the upkeep. But as she watched the removal vans drive away she felt a pang of sadness and a sense of loss. The house was where her children grew up. The house was where she and her husband had shared so many laughs and tears. The house was a part of her history. Susan realized that the house was not just a building but a part of her identity. It was a symbol of her life and all the memories that she had created there. As the last of the removal vans pulled away Susan took a deep breath and closed the door of the small bungalow that she had moved into. She knew that this was the start of a new chapter in her life. A chapter without the big house that she had called home for so long. The house that had seen so much of her life. The house that she had loved so much. But as she settled into her new home Susan realized that she had taken a part of the old house with her. The memories would always be there and the house would always be a part of her.

He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. He told me about their big teeth, their long necks, and how they roared. He also told me about the different types of dinosaurs and how some were big and some were small. He was so excited to share his knowledge and I was impressed by his enthusiasm and attention to detail. It was clear that he had learned a lot from watching the programme, and he was eager to tell me more. As a parent, it is wonderful to see your child develop an interest in something and to see them learning from it. It is also a great opportunity to encourage their curiosity and love of learning. Here are a few ways you can encourage your child‚Äôs learning through screen time: 1. Ask questions: Encourage your child to think critically about what they are watching by asking them questions about the content. This will help them to develop their critical thinking skills and to think more deeply about the subject matter. 2. Discuss the content: After watching a programme or video, discuss it with your child. Ask them what they liked about it, what they found interesting, and what they would like to learn more about. 3. Use interactive learning tools: There are many interactive learning tools available that can help your child to learn through screen time. For example, you can use apps that teach children about different subjects, such as science, history, or language. 4. Create your own content: If your child is interested in"

C2,"Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger‚Äôs intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it.
The dominant male was not pleased, and he let the stranger know it by chasing him off. But the stranger didn‚Äôt give up easily. He kept coming back, day after day, trying to win his way into the group.
The dominant male, however, was having none of it. He began to act aggressively towards the stranger, chasing him and even attacking him. The other members of the group, who had been watching all this from a distance, began to take sides. Some of them sided with the dominant male, while others sympathized with the stranger.
As the days passed, the tension between the two males grew. The dominant male became increasingly aggressive, and the stranger became more and more desperate. Finally, in a dramatic confrontation, the dominant male chased the stranger all the way to the edge of the group‚Äôs territory. There, he confronted the stranger and attacked him viciously, driving him out of the group forever.
Cheney and Seyfarth note that this kind of aggressive behavior is common among vervet monkeys, and that it serves several purposes. For one thing, it helps to maintain the stability of the group. By driving out potential rivals, the dominant male can prevent any challenges to his authority, and keep the group in line.
But there is another, more surprising reason why dominant males behave this way. According to Chen"
C2,"AESTHETICS By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. They have a history of production, distribution, and reception. They are objects that can be seen, handled, and possessed. They are not merely mental constructs or imaginary entities. They are things that can be appreciated and enjoyed in themselves, and their value or significance can be measured by their material qualities and the way they appeal to our senses.

But for another reason: the works of art that are most important for aesthetic theory are often the very ones that are least accessible to direct experience. They are works of art that are difficult to understand, or that have a complex or ambiguous meaning. They are works that require a knowledge of art history, literary theory, or philosophical analysis in order to be fully appreciated. They are works that are not simply beautiful or enjoyable in themselves, but that also have a complex or ambiguous significance that requires interpretation and analysis.

In both cases, the existence of the works of art themselves becomes an obstruction to aesthetic theory. For on the one hand, the materiality of these works makes it difficult to understand their significance or value in terms of purely mental constructs or imaginary entities. And on the other hand, the complexity or ambiguity of these works makes it difficult to understand their significance or value in terms of direct experience or immediate sensory appreciation.

The result is that aesthetic theory has tended to be caught up in a kind of circularity or"

To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face gets in your sandwiches and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins.
I have been known to take a few ill advised steps into the surf only to find myself up to my ankles in the stuff. It is like walking on a never ending stretch of wet spaghetti. It makes a mess of your toes and your clothes and leaves you feeling like you need a bath.
But despite all this I know that sand is a vital part of the beach ecosystem. It is the foundation of the sand dunes that protect the coastline from erosion and flooding. It is the breeding ground for countless species of birds and insects and it is the home of countless tiny creatures that live in the sand.
So I guess I will just have to learn to appreciate sand in all its messy and unpredictable glory. It is a reminder that even in the most beautiful places there can be challenges and difficulties to overcome. And who knows maybe one day I will even learn to surf.

C2,"Art on TV Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details.
In the past, art programmes on television have been the subject of much criticism. They have been accused of being dull, pretentious, and inaccessible to a general audience. So why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera, which has the ability to show a whole work of art and then move in close to examine the details.
One reason for this failure may be that television is not well-suited to the subject matter. Painting and sculpture are complex and subtle, and they cannot be easily reduced to sound bites or visual gimmicks. They require a more thoughtful and considered approach, which may not be the strength of television as a medium.
Another reason may be that television is often more interested in personalities than in art. Artists are often portrayed as eccentric or enigmatic figures, rather than as serious artists with a body of work to be appreciated. This can make the programmes feel more like celebrity profiles than serious art appreciation.
Finally, there may be a lack of understanding and knowledge about the visual arts within the television industry itself. Many television producers and executives may not have a deep understanding of the subject matter, and may be more interested in sensational or controversial content than in providing a thoughtful and informative programme about art"
C2,"The Actor‚Äôs Craft Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they‚Äôre compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. Some actors feel that they are being reduced to mere commodities, rather than respected artists. This makes them defensive and hostile towards the media and the public. The following are some of the reasons why actors are often ridiculed and looked down upon:
1. Over-glorification: The media often creates an image of actors as glamorous, wealthy, and successful. This creates a false impression of the profession and sets unrealistic expectations for the public. When actors fail to meet these expectations, they are ridiculed and criticized.
2. Lack of understanding: Many people do not understand the complexity of the actor‚Äôs craft. They assume that acting is easy and that anyone can do it. This lack of understanding leads to disrespect and contempt for actors.
3. Over-emphasis on personal lives: The media often focuses on the personal lives of actors rather than their work. This creates an impression that actors are more interesting for their personal lives than their professional achievements.
4. Misconceptions about the actor‚Äôs role: Some people believe that actors are merely decorative elements in a film or play, rather than artists who bring characters to life. This misconception leads to disrespect and contempt for actors.
5. Unrealistic expectations: The public often has unrealistic expectations of actors, expecting them to be perfect in every role"
C2,"Work Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change. Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood and even among individuals who have won eminence there is often bitterness behind the fame. In his book How Work Works, Theodore Zeldin, a psychotherapist and social critic, explores the deep-seated reasons for this discontent and offers a vision of a new kind of working life that would be more fulfilling and beneficial for all. He argues that the current model of work is based on the idea that people are interchangeable parts, and that work is something to be endured until retirement. Zeldin suggests that work should be seen as an integral part of life, something that brings us joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose. He argues that we need to move away from the traditional model of work and towards a more flexible, creative, and fulfilling approach. He also suggests that we need to rethink the way we measure success and recognize the value of all kinds of work, not just the traditional professions. By challenging our assumptions about work and the way we organize our society, Zeldin offers a vision of a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

Work is a fundamental aspect of human life, but for many people, it is also a source of frustration and dissatisfaction. The current model of work, based on the idea that people are interchangeable parts and work is something to be endured until retirement, is no longer sustainable.

Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth they will soon be exchanging words. Language is the foundation of culture and the basis of civilization. It is the primary means of communication among humans and is essential for cooperation, trade, and conflict resolution. Language is also a source of creativity and a means of self-expression. It allows us to convey our thoughts and feelings to others and to share our experiences and ideas. Language is a tool of power and a means of social control. It can be used to inspire and to manipulate, to persuade and to coerce. Language is a reflection of our history and our society and is shaped by the social and cultural context in which it is used. It can also be a source of identity and a means of communication across cultures and borders. Language is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that is central to human life and experience. Without language we would be unable to communicate our thoughts or feelings or to participate fully in the social and cultural life of our communities. Language is a fundamental aspect of human nature and is essential for our survival and well-being. Language is a powerful force that can shape our perceptions of the world and our place in it.

C2,"Kinetic Art Rejoice ‚Äî the well-nigh impossible has happened: London‚Äôs austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not thankfully by some huge-budget mega-hyped multi-media extravaganza but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art ‚Äî that is art which is concerned with movement ‚Äî in the twentieth century.
The exhibition, curated by Ian Alteveer, covers a vast range of works from Europe, the United States, and Japan, spanning from the 1930s to the 1990s. It includes paintings, sculptures, installations, and films, by artists such as Alexander Calder, Dan Flavin, and Yayoi Kusama, among many others.
The show is divided into several sections, each of which focuses on a different aspect of kinetic art. There is a section dedicated to the early pioneers of the movement, such as L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy and Naum Gabo, who explored the relationship between art and technology. Another section looks at the ways in which artists used kinetic principles to create immersive environments, such as the light installations of James Turrell and the sound sculptures of David Tudor.
One of the most fascinating aspects of the exhibition is the way in which it highlights the interconnectedness of the different artistic movements of the 20th century. For example, the section on minimalism includes works by artists such as Sol LeWitt and Donald Judd, who were interested in the relationship between the object and the space around it. At the same time, the exhibition also shows how kinetic art was influenced by other movements, such as abstract expressionism and op art.

C2,"Paul Simon Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked with their destinies. The 1950s were a time of great social change and upheaval, and rock and roll was a reflection of that. The music was a way for young people to express their frustration with the status quo and to challenge the conventions of their elders. Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis were the first generation of rock stars, and their music was a call to rebellion and freedom. They sang about cars, girls, and dancing, but they also sang about the struggles of growing up and the desire for independence. The music was raw, energetic, and unapologetic, and it spoke to a generation of young people who were looking for a way to express their own identity and to challenge the rules and expectations of their parents. In the 1960s, rock and roll continued to evolve, and it became a powerful force for social change. Bob Dylan and The Beatles were among the most influential musicians of this era, and their music reflected the growing awareness of social and political issues. Dylan's songs spoke of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, while The Beatles explored themes of love, drugs, and spirituality. Rock and roll also became more diverse, with the emergence of new genres such as psychedelic rock, folk rock, and heavy metal. These"
C2,"POETRY RECITALS At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view.
- F.R. Leavis, ""The Great Tradition""
The literary scene is always in a state of flux, with new voices and styles emerging all the time. But as F.R. Leavis notes in his essay ""The Great Tradition,"" it is only with the benefit of hindsight that we can truly understand the patterns and orders of eminence that emerged in the literary landscape.
As a poet, I have always been fascinated by the way that poetry can capture the essence of a particular moment in time. Whether it is the political and social upheavals of the 1960s, the personal and emotional struggles of the 1980s, or the technological and cultural shifts of the 21st century, poetry has the power to distill these moments into something that is both timeless and uniquely of its time.
One of the ways that I approach this task is through the practice of poetry recital. By reading my own and others' poems aloud, I am able to bring the words to life in a way that is different from simply reading them on the page. The sound and rhythm of the words, the inflection and intonation of the voice, all combine to create a unique and powerful experience for the listener.

C2,"CRYING Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness. But as adults we cry for a range of reasons including grief sadness and even simple pleasure. As humans we have evolved to be highly social creatures and crying is a powerful way to communicate our emotions to others. It may well have evolved to serve social functions. For example crying can elicit empathy and support from others and may even have evolved to act as a form of communication in its own right. Whether crying evolved to be a byproduct of other evolutionary adaptations or as a direct adaptation itself the fact that it is such an integral and universal part of human experience suggests that it must have some important function.

The passage suggests that Charles Darwin may have been incorrect in his assumption that the human tendency to cry has no obvious evolving purpose. In fact, scientists have identified several potential reasons why humans might cry, including:

1. Social significance: Crying is believed to play a role in developing the attachment between mother and child, and as adults, we cry to communicate our emotions to others.
2. Helplessness: Tears may be an expression of helplessness, particularly during childhood.
3. Grief and sadness: Crying is a common response to loss and sadness.
4. Simple pleasure: Crying can also be a response to joy or simple pleasure.

The passage also notes that humans are highly social cre"

C2,The Lure of the Kitchen When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is on the face of it an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long pressured menial - and badly paid. The hours are unsocial and the pay is low. Even the most successful chefs are often subject to the whims of their employers and are frequently bullied and humiliated by the kitchen staff. In my case I think I was attracted to the kitchen because of the promise of creativity and self-expression. Cooking is a form of artistic expression and I enjoyed the idea of creating something beautiful and satisfying from raw materials. I also enjoyed the social side of the kitchen. It is a place where people come together to share food and drink and to enjoy each other's company. I was also drawn to the kitchen because of the sense of tradition and history that it represents. Cooking is a skill that has been passed down through generations and it has a rich cultural heritage. I was excited by the prospect of being part of this tradition and of contributing to it in my own way. In the end I did not become a chef. I discovered that I was not cut out for the long hours and the physical demands of the job. I also found that I was not as creative as I had thought and that I was not as good at cooking as I wanted to be. I still enjoy cooking and I still appreciate the artistry and tradition of the kitchen. But I have come to realize that the lure of the kitchen is not just about the food. It is also about the sense of community and tradition that it represents. It
C2,"TIM RICE I was ushered into the young man‚Äôs drawing room an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class. As a guest I was accorded a degree of respect and attention that I had not experienced in the less formal atmosphere of the kitchen where I had been greeted with a nod and a grunt. Tim Rice, the renowned lyricist and playwright, greeted me warmly, his eyes sparkling with amusement as he surveyed the disarray of his sitting room. He was a small, neat man with a mischievous glint in his eye, a man who had spent his life surrounded by books and music and who had managed to retain an air of youthful energy and enthusiasm despite his advancing years. As we sat down to talk, I found myself feeling a little starstruck in his presence. Tim Rice was one of the most successful and influential figures in the world of musical theatre, responsible for some of the most iconic and enduring shows of the past half century. He had collaborated with some of the greatest composers of our time, including Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alan Menken, and had written lyrics for some of the most memorable songs in musical history. As we talked, I found myself asking him questions that I had always wanted to ask but had never had the chance. What was it like working with Andrew Lloyd Webber? How did he come up with the lyrics for songs like ""Superstar"" and ""I Dreamed a Dream""? And what was the secret to"
C2,"Advertising on trial If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. The recession in advertising was even worse. Many advertising agencies were forced to cut back on staff and costs. Some even closed their doors altogether. The impact on the industry was devastating.

But the 1990s also saw the beginning of the digital revolution in advertising. And it was this that ultimately saved the industry from its slump. The advent of the world wide web and the rise of the internet as a major medium for advertising opened up new opportunities for advertisers. And for agencies that were willing to adapt and embrace the new technologies. The shift from traditional media such as print and television to online media such as websites and email marketing was a major factor in the recovery of the advertising industry.

One of the most significant trends in digital advertising is the rise of programmatic buying. This involves using software to automate the process of buying and selling ad space. By using data and algorithms to target specific audiences and optimize campaigns programmatic buying can offer significant efficiency and effectiveness gains over traditional methods.

Another trend that is gaining traction is the use of native advertising. This involves creating content that is designed to look and feel like the platform on which it appears. Native ads are often more engaging and effective than traditional display ads because they are more relevant to the user and blend in more"
C2,"How to Write Poetry Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face.



But since you asked so nicely, I will share a few of my own poetic techniques, and the way I approach the craft.

First, I find it helpful to read a lot of poetry. Not just the works of other poets, but also poetry itself. I mean, I read a lot of other things too, but poetry is the thing that feeds my soul.

When I come across a line or a phrase that strikes me as particularly beautiful or effective, I'll dog-ear the page or make a note in the margin. I keep a file of these lines and phrases, and sometimes I'll go back through them and try to incorporate them into my own work.

Another technique I use is to write about the things that are most important to me. This could be a person, a place, a memory, or an emotion. I find that when I write about what's truly on my mind and in my heart, the words flow more easily and the poem feels more authentic.

I also try to use language in unexpected ways. I love to play with metaphor and simile, to find new ways to describe things that are familiar to us all. This can help to create a sense of wonder or surprise, and can also make the poem more memorable.

Finally, I think it's important to be willing to take risks in your writing"
C2,Online Literary Criticism For All Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun? From the outset the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice however a certain amount of technical know-how was required at least in the early years. In the 1990s many people were able to bypass this requirement by using simple web-based tools such as GeoCities and Angelfire. These platforms allowed users to create and publish their own web pages with minimal technical expertise. However as the Internet became more complex and sophisticated these platforms became less accessible to the average user. This led to a proliferation of online literary criticism that was more than just harmless fun. In this essay I will argue that online literary criticism has become an important aspect of literary culture and that it has the potential to democratize literary criticism. 2. The Rise of Online Literary Criticism The rise of online literary criticism can be traced back to the early days of the Internet. In the 1990s the web was still in its infancy and there were few established platforms for publishing literary criticism. As a result many scholars and critics began to experiment with new forms of online criticism. One of the earliest and most influential online literary magazines was the Millions which launched in 2003. The Millions was founded by C. Max Magee and it quickly became a go-to destination for book reviews and literary criticism. Since then numerous other online literary magazines have emerged including The Paris Review The Rumpus and The Huffington Post. 3. The Benefits of Online Literary Crit

She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement) before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone. The sisters were worried that if Chen knew about Lily‚Äôs driving he would be shocked and disappointed in her.

Lily's driving was a secret kept from Chen for a time, and the sisters were worried that if he found out, he would be shocked and disappointed in her. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, taking great care to drive over a tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement). Despite the bump, Lily was able to complete the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone. The sisters were afraid that if Chen knew about Lily's driving, he would be upset with her.

In the end, it was not the driving that caused the problem, but the secrecy surrounding it. Chen discovered the truth when he saw Lily's car parked outside the gasworks, and he was shocked and disappointed in her for keeping such a dangerous secret from him. The sisters were relieved that he had not been hurt, but they knew that their secret was now out, and they would have to face the consequences.

In the end, the secrecy surrounding Lily's driving caused more problems than the driving itself. Chen discovered the"
C2,"We are Talking Big Boots here. Really BIGTIME Boots. I stood in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money no object. I wore the whole truly cowboy outfit and if you had the outfit you might be a cowboy. I was a cowgirl, but you get the idea. I wore my hair in braids, and I had a bandana on my head. I was in character, or as much as one can be in character when one is not actually a cowgirl. I was a character in a story, a story that I was writing, or at least trying to. I had been working on it for a long time, but I was not making much progress. I was stuck on a plot point, and I was not sure how to get past it. I had tried everything I could think of, but nothing seemed to work. I was beginning to think that I would never finish the story, that it would just sit there in my head forever, unwritten. But then, as I stood on those rocks in my big boots, something clicked. It was as if the desert sand and the boots and the bandana had all combined to give me a sudden burst of inspiration. I knew exactly what to do next, and I knew exactly how to get my cowgirl character out of the jam she was in. I was so excited that I danced around on the rocks, my boots thumping against the sand. I was so happy that I almost forgot that I was in the middle of nowhere, alone, and that I had no way of getting back to civilization. Almost. But I didn't forget. I knew that I"
C2,"Love them fear them worship them human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports There's a bump bump bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird a bird of portent augury and divination. In the Western world, at least, birds have long been associated with the supernatural, the divine, and the unknown. They are the messengers of the gods, the harbingers of doom, the interpreters of dreams. In ancient Egypt, the ibis was a symbol of Thoth, the god of wisdom and magic. In Greek mythology, the owl was a companion of Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war. In medieval Europe, the raven was a harbinger of doom and death, while the dove was a symbol of peace and redemption. Even in modern times, birds continue to fascinate us with their beauty, their grace, and their otherworldly nature. They are the stuff of poetry and song, the subject of countless paintings and photographs. And yet, as much as we love and fear them, we also worship them. We worship their beauty, their grace, and their otherworldly nature. We worship the way they soar through the sky, their wings outstretched, their hearts full of joy and freedom. We worship the way they sing, their voices rising and falling like the tides of the sea. And we worship the way they connect us to the natural world, to the rhythms and rhymes of the earth and sky. In short, we worship the way birds make us feel alive, connected, and a part of something greater than ourselves. So"

C2,"Every Picture Tells a Story Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer but also illuminating. Working on a script I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point. The images on the page told me what was important. The words in the text were superfluous. The same with character description. The way a character looked was less important than how they behaved. The way they walked and talked was more revealing than their physical features. The same with backstory. The novel might spend pages on the characters history but in the adaptation I could condense it down to a few key details that were relevant to the scene at hand. The process of adaptation taught me to be more concise in my writing and to trust that the images I created would tell the story.
The process of adaptation also taught me to be more attentive to the language I used. Because I was working with a limited amount of time and space I had to be precise in my language and to cut out anything that was not essential to the scene. This was a liberating experience because it forced me to think about the words I was using and to choose them more carefully. It also made me more conscious of the way I structured my sentences and paragraphs. The result was that my writing became more efficient and more effective.
In addition to these technical lessons the process of adaptation also taught me something about the nature of storytelling itself. I came to realize that the best stories are those that are economical and efficient. They are not bogged down by unnecessary details or excessive exposition. They trust the reader to fill in the gaps and"
C2,"The Heat is On We‚Äôve all heard of global warming but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives? Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world.
The earth‚Äôs average temperature has already risen by about 0.8 degrees Celsius since the late 1800s, and this warming trend is expected to continue unless greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the earth‚Äôs average temperature could rise by another 2 to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current rate. This could lead to more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and storms, as well as rising sea levels and more acidic oceans.
The effects of global warming will not be felt equally by all. The poor and vulnerable populations, such as those living in small island developing states, least developed countries, and arctic communities, are likely to be disproportionately affected by climate change. Rising sea levels, for example, could lead to the displacement of people living in low-lying areas, while more frequent and intense storms could damage homes, infrastructure, and agriculture, leading to food and water shortages.
In addition to the direct physical effects of global warming, there are also potential indirect effects on human health, economic stability, and social and political stability. For example, warmer temperatures could increase the spread of disease, while more frequent and severe weather events could"
C2,"Maps The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth‚Äôs surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. The map is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional surface.
Maps are essential tools for navigation, urban planning, and many other fields. They provide a visual representation of an area‚Äôs topography, land use, and other features. Maps can be created using a variety of techniques, including:
1. Cartography: The art and science of creating maps. Cartographers use a variety of techniques to create maps, including:

a. Projection: The process of transforming the curved surface of the earth into a flat surface.

b. Scale: The relationship between the distance on the map and the distance on the ground.

c. Symbolization: The use of symbols and colors to represent different features on the map.

d. Generalization: The process of simplifying the map by reducing the amount of detail.

2. Remote sensing: The process of creating maps from data collected by sensors or satellites. Remote sensing can be used to create maps of:

a. Land use: The way an area is used, such as agriculture, urban development, or conservation.

b. Land cover: The types of vegetation, water, and other features that cover an area.

c. Topography: The shape and elevation of the earth‚Äôs surface.

d. Environmental monitoring: The monitoring of environmental conditions, such as"
C2,"HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. He led three British expeditions to the Antarctic between 1907 and 1922, and his 1914-17 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which aimed to cross the continent from coast to coast, was one of the most remarkable feats of endurance and leadership in history. But the reason why Shackleton has been rediscovered in recent years as a model of good management is less well known. In 2007, Tim Jarvis, a former Australian soldier and adventurer, led an expedition to retrace Shackleton's journey across the Antarctic, using the same ship and equipment that Shackleton had. The expedition was a success, but it also highlighted the qualities that made Shackleton such an effective leader. Jarvis says, ""Shackleton was a people person. He was able to inspire and motivate his team, even in the most dire circumstances."" This is a quality that many modern executives are looking for in their own leaders. In today's fast-paced and competitive business world, leaders need to be able to inspire and motivate their teams to achieve their goals. Shackleton's ability to do this in the most challenging of circumstances is a testament to his exceptional leadership skills. Shackleton's leadership style was based on a deep understanding of his team and their needs,"
C2,Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain. In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. The advent of the internet and digital technology has further expanded the range of musical experiences now available to us. This has created new challenges for musicians composers music educators and all those involved in the music industry. In this article we examine some of the key issues facing music in Britain today. The rise of digital music distribution. The internet has revolutionized the way we listen to music. Digital music distribution has made it possible for artists to reach a global audience without the need for a record deal. This has created new opportunities for independent musicians and small labels but it has also made it more difficult for established labels to maintain their traditional business model. The importance of live music. While digital music distribution has made it possible for artists to reach a global audience the live music scene remains crucial to the health of the industry. Live performances offer a unique experience for audiences and provide an opportunity for artists to connect with their fans and build their reputation. However the rise of digital music distribution has led to a decline in the number of live performances and the number of people attending them. The need for music education. Music education is crucial for developing skills and understanding of music. However the current education system in Britain is under threat from budget cuts and the narrowing of the curriculum. This could have a significant impact on the future of music in Britain as the next generation of musicians and music lovers are not receiving the education they need to sustain the industry

Published in: Photography
Topics: Photography, Camera, Photographer, Visual Information, Technical Skills, Aesthetic Skills, Personal Views, Social And Cultural Norms
Moreover, the photographer's decisions about the composition, lighting, and focus of the image are influenced by the context in which the photograph is taken and the intended use of the photograph. For instance, a portrait photographer may choose to use a flattering lighting and a close-up composition to make the subject appear confident and attractive, while a documentary photographer may use a more natural lighting and a wider composition to convey the subject's environment and situation.
In conclusion, the act of taking a photograph is a complex process that involves a multitude of decisions and considerations. From the technical skills of framing and capturing the image to the aesthetic choices of composition and lighting, the photographer's personal views and experience play a significant role in determining the final image. Additionally, the social and cultural norms of the time and place in which the photograph is taken can also influence the photographer's decisions, shaping the final image in subtle yet important ways.
In the field of photography, the photographer's role is not limited to simply pressing the shutter button and capturing an image. Rather, it involves a range of creative and"

My father with my brother Maurice in tow had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls‚Äô school I attended. My brother and I had spent the weekend with our mother in the country. 

I was feeling particularly stroppy and had been in a foul mood since my return from school. I had been bullied and teased by the other girls in my class and it had really got to me. I had been feeling down and out of sorts for days, and my father‚Äôs words only served to make me feel worse.

C2,"MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house I learned that opera is in fact only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That‚Äôs as it should be of course. Opera is a form of musical drama, and the music is the heart and soul of the art form. But the theatre is crucial too. It provides the setting, the characters, the dramatic structure, the visual and aural framework in which the music can shine. Without the theatre, the music would be abstract and unmoored. Without the music, the theatre would be dull and uninteresting. The two art forms are inextricably linked, and the best opera productions are those that find the perfect balance between the two. So what‚Äôs the key to making opera work on stage? Well, for starters, the singers need to be both vocally and dramatically excellent. They need to be able to convey the emotions and intentions of their characters through their voice alone, and they need to be able to act as well as sing. It‚Äôs a tall order, but it‚Äôs one that many opera companies are able to fill. The directors and designers also play a crucial role in bringing the opera to life. They need to be able to interpret the composer‚Äôs intentions and translate them into a visual and aural experience that complements and enhances the music. It‚Äôs a delicate process, but one that can result in some truly magical moments. And then there‚Äôs the orchestra. Without the orchestra, the opera would be nothing more than a series of vocal performances."
C2,"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology 'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. (p. 13)

In this passage, the author is discussing the term ""broadcasting"" and its origins. The author argues that the term originally referred to the act of sowing seeds broadly by hand, which is an agricultural metaphor that symbolizes the idea of planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The author suggests that this metaphor is not only agricultural but also modernist, as it implies a sense of optimism and control over the growth process. The author goes on to suggest that this metaphor has been applied to the field of communication and broadcasting, where it has taken on a new meaning, referring to the distribution of information to a wide audience through various media channels.

In this passage, the author is using etymology, the study of word origins, to explore the meaning and history of the term ""broadcasting."" The author is using the term ""social shaping"" to describe the way in which language and culture shape our understanding of technology and its applications. By examining the origins of the term ""broadcasting,"" the author is able to reveal the cultural and historical context in which the term was developed, and to show how it has evolved over time.

The author is also using a rhetorical device called synecdoche, where a part of something is used to represent the whole."
C2,"Writing Reviews Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner‚Äôs point of view. Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. The review is written, published, and then forgotten. The review is not a literary work in its own right; it is an act of criticism, an exercise in the art of judging.  Kermode‚Äôs book is a collection of essays that explore the craft of review-writing, examining the nature of the review and its role in contemporary culture. He argues that the review is not a literary work in its own right, but rather an act of criticism that serves to help readers make informed decisions about what to read. He also explores the tension between the review as a personal opinion and as an objective assessment of a work‚Äôs merits, and the ways in which reviews can shape cultural and literary history. Throughout the book, Kermode draws on his own experiences as a reviewer, as well as on the work of other notable critics and reviewers, to offer insights into the craft of review-writing and its importance in contemporary culture.

It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. Orson Welles, the film‚Äôs director, producer, co-writer, and star, had long since moved on to other things - he was still only 25 when the film was released - and it was not until the late 1950s that he began to see the film‚Äôs value. Welles had been working in radio and television, and he had even directed a Broadway play, but he had not had a hit in any of these fields. It was only when he began to revive Citizen Kane that his career began to take off. The film was first shown on television in 1956, and it was an immediate hit. It was aired on the ABC network, and it was seen by more than 10 million people. The film was re-released in theaters in 1962, and it became a cult classic. The film was not a commercial success when it was first released, but it has since become one of the most highly regarded films of all time. It was named the greatest film of all time by the American Film Institute in 1998, and it has been included in Time magazine‚Äôs list of the 100 greatest films of all time.
