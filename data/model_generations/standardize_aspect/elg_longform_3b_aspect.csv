A2,"Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings like museums to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. The interior designer draws the plans so that the architect can make sure that the architect will make the building like he or she imagined it. And we have engineers. 
These are just some of the people who work in construction. But there are more. They are called workers. The workers take care of all the work that has to be done. These people don't think about how buildings will look. They only think about how the buildings will work. And they are very good at that. 
These are the workers who build a house or a statue or something like that. But they also make a road. You see, roads make travel. The workers that build a road are just as important as the builders who build buildings.

People have to travel to work. And so the workers that build the roads make sure that it's safe. They make sure that the road is well built and that it is well looked after. They also make sure that people have enough food and water to make sure they get to work. 
You see, the workers that build the roads are just as important as the workers that build the buildings.

You are thinking too quickly. You need to slow down. People always make decisions after a lot of thought. The workers decide the roads and the roads decide the people who use them.

Look at me. I'm working with you. I'm designing buildings. My work helps you. My work helps you a lot. So"

After we go the people here in Dante's Peak will stay. They have their shops and their businesses. You think only about volcanoes but this is about money too.' 'OK' Harry said with a smile. And he got ready to leave. 
  
 'Wait! Harry...' Paul said 'Harry, I've got something very important to tell you. You are going to have a new business partner.' 
  
 Harry looked at Paul who was holding his wedding ring. 'What?' said Harry 'I can't have an affair with your best friend! It's a sin! I'm a Protestant!' 
  
 Harry just laughed. It was not the first time that he had heard such silly jokes. But Paul was sincere. 'Harry, you must change. You are a wonderful man but you need a life partner. You are so perfect for each other. Let's work on a plan.' 
  
 The next day Harry was happy. He was going to have a new life partner. And he started to take everything calmly. He had to keep a clear head. He had a meeting with his friends the next day, but everything looked good. The day passed well. Harry was going to become a businessman. After his meetings he started to prepare a proposal. He sent Paul a postcard about this proposal. 'Come soon with your answer. It's urgent.' 
  
 And he read all Paul's postcards: 'Harry, we're going to start a new life together!'. Harry was happy. 
  
 Next day Harry told the news to his best friend. 'Paul, this is very"
A2,"Careful! Fight with your head don't fight with your heart boy!' shouted Bowen. The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter. But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code. Sir Bowen and all the kings princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. But now the peasants are angry, greedy and the knights who help them are no more knights. Sir Bowen was sad, he had to teach Einon the Old Code. The Old Code wasn't about killing, but about fighting and showing respect for your enemies. It taught you not to fight with your head and not with your heart but with your body. You didn't fight dirty, you didn't kick and punch. When you attacked someone you kicked and punched. With the Old Code you fought the person you wanted to fight with the least, and you didn't even want to fight him. You only fought when you had to. And when you had to fight someone you'd ask him to leave the castle. Then you could go inside and make a deal with him. You'd tell him that you wanted to fight him only when you could and that you'd only do it in the afternoon. He'd leave when the sun was gone and you would've made a fair deal. But Einon was a coward. He always ran when they'd have a duel. He was afraid. He always ran. And that's when Sir Bowen decided to change the old code. He started with the guards. He kicked and punched them until they started to fight him. He didn't want to have to ask them to leave before he could fight. So instead of asking them to leave he'd just beat the life out of them. And when they'd started to run he'd knock them out"
A2,"The History of Farming Before people started farming they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. This was because these people could use plants to grow food. 

Today farming is very important for us. We use farming to make food for the whole world. Farming has brought a lot of happiness to us. We cannot imagine what would have happened if we did not have farming.

A2,"ICE-FISHING If you drive north from Toronto for three hours you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter the lake becomes ice and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. In summer the fishing is even better and the lake is ice-free. You can fish from a boat or take a canoe. You have to follow all the rules on safety. You need to keep your feet on the ice. You can’t go into the water and swim. Fishing can be fun. You can fish for any kind of fish - snapper, walleye, herring and even salmon. If you are lucky you can catch the king salmon, which you can take back to Quebec. If you catch a big fish you can even share it with all your friends, because they love salmon. It's more fun if you go ice fishing in winter because the ice is so cold and solid. You can sit on the boat and look at the lake while you fish. It can be very relaxing. If you are a big hunter like me you can have a special day on the ice with your dog. There are many trails in the lake for you and your dog to walk on and chase after your food. When you are very tired you can go and lie down in the forest on a bench and have a hot chocolate with your friend. It's more relaxing than sitting on the ice with your dog. Fishing is a great hobby. People from all over the world come to have fun there. In winter you can travel there by car. In summer you can drive there in a canoe. It is a great hobby. This activity is very beautiful. There are beautiful people"
A2,"A man heard me and looked round. Then this big man saw me in the corn. He walked to me and I began to shout loudly:'His foot is going to kill me!'The man stopped. For a minute he looked down at me carefully. (We look at a small animal in the same way and think: 'Will it hurt me? No. It is my foot that will hurt me!) Then he said to me'Why are you shouting?'I answered:'It is my foot that will hurt me!'The man looked down again at my feet. Then,'Go  to the next field'He told his colleague to carry the man to the next field. The following day (it was Sunday) the colleague called me. He told me that he had taken the man to the hospital. When I told him that I had looked at the foot, the man told me he would not mind walking home. At 5.00 p.m., as planned, I got off the train. I began to walk towards home. But, before reaching home, I heard a noise:'It has broken the glass in my shoe.'I rushed back home. That evening my mother was angry with me. At 6.00 p.m., as planned, I got on the train to leave for the airport. I sat on a corner of the car and began to think about what to do. A policeman arrived. At 7.00 p.m., as planned, I got on the plane to return home.

A2,"New books this month The Long Night This is David Reilly's first book. David became a writer after teaching English for several years. Maha is a nurse in northern Australia where she works in a small hospital. One day a baby is so ill that Maha has to drive all night to get her to the nearest big city. The book is set in a small town so it is all too familiar in many ways. There are some very funny scenes about how ordinary people cope in a remote rural part of Australia, like the way a couple of locals go round in a circle in the middle of the night, trying to get to the neighbours house to fetch some firewood. It does seem a bit silly though and a bit like a spoof. I've read it several times since I've read about it last year and it's always fun. You can buy it from most bookshops. The Long Night by David Reilly.
The Summer of Fear by David Mitchell This is David Mitchell's second book and if you like your books a bit dark, it will be a good choice. It's set in Northern England in the late 1970's and it's about a bunch of friends who start going out on dangerous walks in the woods in search of a mythical beast. Sometimes they find it, sometimes they don't. It's about the journey they go on together rather than their journey through the woods, and if you've read the first book I'm not sure if the plot would be clear enough for you to follow. There are lots of different parts to the book to keep you occupied. I can see it being a real pleasure to read for a long period of time. If I'd read it in one sitting though I don't know if I could read it all again in one sitting. I'd have to do something"
A2,"Big cats There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot! Lions are big and can grow up to 4.5m in length. They are usually spotted and will run at full speed in the wild. They are not known for their stealth and are very vocal. Most cats don't like to be touched. They are not afraid of humans but they may bite. Bears are the smallest cats. These animals are normally smaller than a wolf and grow about a foot long. They are typically black in colour and will live in the woods. Wolves are the most dangerous animal for humans. They look like cats but they have a larger body. They are very dangerous and their hunting instincts is second to none. They have huge teeth and are capable of ripping flesh. Crocodiles are the smallest animals. They are 1.8m long but can grow up to 4m in length. Crocodiles are mainly found in the Amazon. They are harmless animals that like to stay in the water. The smallest of all, is the puma. They are smaller than any of the above mentioned animals and have a fur that makes them look like a lion. The puma is the smallest cat and is known for being ferocious. They will fight to the death if it comes to it and will not hesitate to attack people if provoked. These animals will only eat meat from the animals they hunt.

'Silvia dear' Marco said 'you look wonderful...' He stopped. Silvia didn't look wonderful. Her face was red and she looked unhappy. 'How did you come in my room, dear' Marco asked 'and what are you doing here?'. 'There's an electric socket here that's not working and I needed to fix the plug'. 'That's it? That's all you needed' Marco looked at Silvia and said 'I think you could've done better... I would've invited you in, but we have guests now. Please go upstairs, please...' Suddenly Silvia started crying. Marco asked 'What happened?' 'I saw you come in and that's why I came in. Please come in' 'What can I do for you dear? Please don't go upstairs. I don't want to see anybody now'. Marco looked around at Silvia again and said 'Please, come with me. I will take care of you.' He started walking. Suddenly he stopped and said 'Wait, please' and he walked back to his room. 'You shouldn't do that' Silvia said. Marco looked at her and said 'What? That's what I wanted to do. I wanted to look at you.' 'I can't do that now.' 'Why not? I would've invited you in, but you didn't accept.' 'You've invited too many people in recently. I can't cope with it.' Marco looked at her. 'OK. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm sorry.' And Marco went back to his room. 'You need to stop behaving like a child'"
A2,"'I am quite well' I always answered. Why did I say that? Why did I not ask for his help? Perhaps because in one sense it was true. I was not in pain. 'It cannot be the mysterious illness from the village' I thought. 'My illness is now three weeks old. What's more, I am quite well.' 'If you are so well, why aren't you at home?' 'I am here.' Then I said: 'I was right when I said the plague is not contagious. I feel better when I am at home than when I am in my house in the city.' 'And what about you?' 'I feel as if I have forgotten everything. I remember very little.' 'What will your wife do?' I asked. 'She will go in. I know she will have food for us and will stay for a time. Then she will return home. But I'm sure she will feel at home there.' There was sadness in my voice. I said: 'You'll stay and look after the house. I'll come back.' 'And what about your sister?' 'She's already in the village. She will join me in a little while.' 'But will you be in my house too?' 'Of course I will. I know I'm not well. But I'm sure I will be better soon.' Advertisement

The man who asked me these questions was my cousin, the one who wrote the letter to my mother. He thought I was still in good health and that everything was well. I did not believe him. But I had no choice. I returned to my house in the city and began to tell my wife what was happening. 'I'm ill, but I will go home soon' I told her. '"

A2,"BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window. According to Saunders, burglars find an unguarded door or window and, after some time or through the use of a crowbar, cut the locks and enter the house. Some of the burglars use an alarm. He said burglars do not find anything because they are looking for jewelry, watches or money. In general, the police recommend keeping jewelry in a safe room, a safe, in the garage or under a bed. Inspector Saunders also told our newspaper that burglars like to work on the weekend. According to the police, burglars know that house parties are held and that people are out and about during this time. Inspector Saunders said that burglars break into the house by using the door and window as a ladder and climbing the wall. He also said that burglar bars are not suitable for people. The police added that the most important thing for a house to prevent burglary is to provide surveillance to ensure that nobody comes in the house. However, with that in mind, if a window or a door is unguarded and it is unlocked, it is more likely that burglars will enter the house. The police also recommended putting an alarm or a bell, on the inside of the house, in a watchman's duty to alert the residents in case of a burglar. Inspector Saunders also said that the burglar will do anything to get what he wants, because there are no police officers present. Inspector Saunders recommended the installation of a video surveillance system and cameras at the"

She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months Stephen cuts this wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Then the wool sells for three times as much as Stephen sold it for. Now, the Blackler family is the most rich family in England, at least the rich of the family that includes Jenny. But the other four Blackler siblings are struggling.

A2,"Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good in the water and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair and this keeps them warm in the water. They eat anything, from grass to fish. 
  
 They are called “sea otters” and are common in the water from Mexico to Borneo, but can be found in more than 100 countries. They usually live in rivers and are able to survive on other small creatures. Although they are called otters, they have no beaked nose. They are found in cold and warm waters. 
  
 They are very social and care for the other animals in the community. You can see them going on a hunt or gathering. Some have been known to play with their food and play and chase each other. Some species, including walruses, are very dangerous to handle as they are large and very strong. 
  
 Otters are very clever and can survive on one meal a day. They hunt fish and other small aquatic creatures, and will eat anything living in the water. Otters usually live in small groups which they help to protect the salmon they prey on. They look after small pieces of wood to make it easier for otters to live. 
  
 The animal is called “sea otter” and it is found in more than 100 countries, but can be found in more than 100 countries. They mainly live in the rivers in cold and warmer waters. They can’t swim, so they rely on using their size and strength to hunt their food. They feed on fish,"

We would like to stay somewhere in the centre. Can you help us? Carlos Dear Carlos Hotels in the centre are expensive but I have good news. You only need to think of two things: 1. Go to the beach. You can walk for a bit or just sit on the sand. 2. Go to the beach and enjoy the waves and sun. You can take a bike and pedal along the coast.
If you are looking for other things to do, here are some ideas: 1. Go to the zoo. 2. Go to the beach. 3. Go to the park with the animals. 4. Go to the castle. 5. Go to the museums. 6. Go to the zoo. 7. Go to the temple. 8. Go to the theatre. 9. Take a hike. 10. Go to the market.   There is also a lot to see and do for kids.   You should also book a tour so that you can learn about a new place. 
The last thing that you should do when you are visiting this country is to have fun.   This country is full of amazing people and places to visit.
Have a great trip.

A2,"The history of horse racing From the first history books ever written it is clear that horse racing has always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. In France in the 16th century the first thoroughbred race was organised. Horse racing in England began in the mid-17th century and began to boom during the Industrial Revolution. Racing in France was banned in 1870, but a horse was later stolen and killed at the Meurthe-et-Moselle Racecourse in 1870, causing a boom in horse racing during the next 10 years. Racing was later banned again during the First World War, but was eventually reinstated after the war. It has become a part of many cultures, in particular being played at the Olympics and in many other international sports events. In the UK there is a thriving professional racing industry. Most horse racing is of the jockeys’ formality variety, but there are now two professional racing tracks in Europe, Chantilly and Chantilly International in France. The last professional track was closed in 1995. The professional racing industry was heavily influenced by the American horse racing industry. Today there is much more international racing than there was in the 1930s and racing has been a big part of the British economy for a long time. Racing is now played in many other countries, including Australia and Singapore. More than 90 percent of the horses in England are owned by an individual and a large proportion of these horses are not harnessed to a racehorse and are referred to as workhorses. Racing has also spread outside Europe. Horse racing was a part of many Olympic events from 1912 to 1960. Racing at"

'Where are you going Dad?' I asked. 'To a meeting.' 'What meeting? Can I come?' 'No you're too young' said Dad. 'Too old for a meeting?' I said. Dad looked at me and laughed. 'Yeah you're right. I guess you're right too.' Dad then walked up to the other side of the room and sat down. Mum came to the table and asked 'How many people are going to this meeting?' 'Four' said Dad. Mum then said 'Are you sure about this meeting?' 'Yeah mum. It's important.' Mum then said 'This is a secret meeting. If someone finds out they will ruin your life.' I looked at Dad and he nodded in agreement. I had to sit in this secret room. I could feel everyone watching me and listening to my conversation. Dad then said 'Now there's four of us and there's four of them. The four of us decide who to take down. And no one knows anything about it!' Mum looked at Dad and asked him 'Do you have a plan? Did you have a plan?' 'No, but I know this.' He told her. It was a clue to solve the mystery. Mum looked at Dad and she smiled. Dad smiled back and nodded. I said 'Can you tell me what the clue is.'

'Don Quixote hasn't got a gun so he won't shoot the lion.' The horse's laugh died away and suddenly the wind died and night came on fast. Just then a little boy walked past them. 'I've just got a chance to see him, I wish you would let me,' he said. 'Well you'll see him tonight then!' said Don Quixote. The driver nodded. 'I believe you will,' he said. 'I only wish you'd take my advice,' shouted the boy. 'Don't try to shoot the lion!' 'It would be a good thing,' said Don Quixote, 'but I don't know if it's safe. Let's go and have a look now.' The driver gave him a ride up and down the long highway and when they came to the lions cage he opened it and said, 'Don"
A2,"Bill Prince-Smith Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer and a teacher and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now thirteen years later he has written more than 80 books. Every day he goes into his office and writes. In the evening he gives the work to his wife to read. One of them is ""The Three Little Monkeys"" and the others are ""Molly's Magical Puppy"" and ""The Three Little Pudding Peeps"". The title of the first one is based on what he sees in his own kitchen. ""The Three Little Monkeys"" has an interesting story about a cat, a dog and a monkey who like to eat cakes. In the last story a duck has fallen into the saucepan and, just before, it gets a delicious chocolate pudding. His books are sold everywhere, in Germany alone, but especially in children's bookstores. His most popular ones are ""The Three Little Pudding Peeps"" and ""The Three Little Monkeys"". He enjoys writing because he can read a sentence aloud without getting tired. One of his friends says that in his office he often gets up and starts reading to himself out of curiosity. Sometimes his secretary has to help him because his speech seems to slow down. However, that does not bother him, because he is a teacher after all. His secret to long speech making is simply ""humility"". He teaches children how to read and write with kindness and gentleness. All his children and grandchildren now have their own children's books that they like and, in spite of the competition in the German market, they enjoy their books very much. In his free time, Bill Prince-Smith likes to read to his grandchildren or to go on a holiday. He has visited many beautiful countries. One of them was"
A2,"Line dancing Thousands of people in Britain have a new hobby — line dancing. In almost every town you will find clubs and classes for this new activity. 'Line dancing is easy to learn. If you have two feet and can walk then you can do it!' Fiona Lever a teacher says. The first step is to sign up for a dance course. 'You'll be given a step by step dance lesson. You are taught a basic line dance,' says Valerie Renton. You'll be able to do the steps in a routine like the French shuffle. Another thing you will need is a partner. 'Line dancing takes great technique. It takes lots of practice to master it, but once you have it is a joy to show it off to your friends. But don't try it on anyone younger than 16,' warns Renton. It's not only a pleasure to watch, but also a good way to develop confidence and friendship. But what about a partner? 'There are a lot of different forms of line dancing, so to find a partner you would first have to look in your town,' says Lever. You should start out with a partner of the same gender to get to know each other. After a few months you can become a couple. But if you would like to start a line dance couple without being with a partner you can join an open dance night. Some venues will set up dances specifically for the purpose. Another option is to contact your local senior society. It is a way to develop a new hobby in a more casual setting. Line dancing takes a lot of practice and a lot of effort. 'If you can't dance you shouldn't try it, even if you can find a partner,' Valerie adds. But for people looking to take their line dancing to the"
A2,"Kong went back to Ann and took her down from the high rock. For the first time in this jungle she felt strangely safe. He jumped across a ravine and then across a river. She was a small plaything between his large fingers. Then he stopped and put her down. Kong waited. There was a large tree overhead that he'd always dreamt of. But Kong was a big boy now. So he'd go to it. Kong would climb up its tall trunk and then he'd look down at Ann and wait for her.

As Kong climbed the tree he stared down at the ground. A small brown mole lived in the root system of the tree. It was small and brown and had green and yellow patches of fur. Kong knew that there would be lots of insects in this tree, so he wore a thick pair of leather work boots. They were big boots, so Kong wasn't afraid that the mole might run away from him. But it would probably be a while before the mole came to eat his food.

Kong knew that Ann wasn't real. She wouldn't live much longer. And he wouldn't ever see her again. But there was something else that he wanted to do. He wanted to walk back to where he'd left his ball and his bat. But first he had to climb the tree. He didn't know what kind of bugs he'd encounter in his boots or on the trail. But if Ann weren't real, he'd know that he'd found her in the great tree.

After climbing the tree, Kong stood alone for a while, listening to the sound of his footsteps. Soon he heard a very loud crunch in his shoes. He heard another crunch and another. He soon realized that his shoes"

Her uncle a doctor made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris. The museum is famous for its figures made of wax. She also studied in Paris for some time. Her first attraction was the head of Napoleon. She created his portrait. After that she worked with King Charles IX. Then in 1786, she opened her own museum. When the French revolution started, she had to flee Paris and go to England. Here she stayed for 13 years. Then she went back to Paris, this time to work for King William III. Her figure of Queen Charlotte is also known as Madame Tussaud. She died in London in 1806. People love to see her figures. She is one of the most famous people in London. Some famous persons use her wax figure. She is immortal. Her figure is made from hair and flesh and she wears human clothing. People who see her figure want to touch it. For almost 100 years now, there is a queue to see the figure. When it is not in use, some famous people stand in the queue and enjoy the figures. In her day, she was more famous than her father. When she was alive, people didn't care too much about the French revolution. They just loved her wax figures. She was immortal, like the Queen Charlotte of England.

A2,"The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are quite near each other. On the road between them there are a lot of green hills and fields. On one of these hills is a picture of a very large man. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to him is called Cerne. The man has a very long face and a very small waist. On the other side of the road there is the village of Dorchester. There are no green hills at the other side. On the other hand, the Cerne Giant is always working there so he can live in Dorchester for ever. The man is very tall and very muscular. Also, he has a small face and a very big belly. It is sometimes said that the Cerne Giant lives in the Dorchester. Because of that people from the village often go to the Cerne Giant's house to ask him a question. Also, sometimes, children who are very curious go to the Cerne Giant's house. The children ask him what he thinks about some strange things. Also, the children often get really curious when the Cerne Giant gets a big wound on his leg and he has to walk long distances with a stick to his house.






(The letter that was sent to the Cerne Giant)

Dear Cerne Giant:

It is the beginning of November. There are very few leaves on the trees and some snow is falling in the sky. It is a bit chilly, isn't it? I am sure that you feel very cold and that you want to go to the Dorchester. That is why I thought that maybe we would meet again.

For you, my friends, I am going to tell you some weird stories. First, I am going to tell you"
A2,"The Rhino There are five different types of rhino in the world today. The Black and White Rhino live in the open fields of Africa. The others live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have big heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The great body of the rhino stands on four short legs. The long neck stretches out like a rope. The Rhino has a great horn which is used as a weapon. People in the jungles fight with the rhino to kill it. This causes a lot of problems to the rhino. For example, the horn will prevent the rhino from reproducing so it will start to die out. The horn is also used to make rhino horn. The Rhino is considered a wild animal by some people. There is a lot of poaching for the horns. People in Asian countries often cut the horn of the rhino to cure diseases. People in Africa are not as well informed about the rhino so they often buy the horn. The Horn of the Rhino is sold for over 1,000 Dollars (US$) a kilogram. There is some research into the health effects of the horn. Researchers are trying to find out whether the horn helps with cancer or other diseases. The rhino horn has also been used for religious purposes. For example, the black rhino has been used to make a black cloth which is worn as a cloth by black people. The white rhino has been used to make a white cloth. Rhino horn is also used by the African people for rituals and to cure their diseases. The horns are burned instead of consumed. The horns are so important to people in the African people because the horns are very difficult to find. It takes time to track down rhino horns so the African people often go a long way just to get"
A2,"CANADA GEESE Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there. Last spring Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. The young birds were too small to stay at home and lived on the farm. The adults, however, had no place to go because of the cold winters. They stayed close to their winter home and returned to Canada in spring when it gets warmer. There are seven or eight small breeding grounds in Canada that are usually populated by Canada Geese in Canada. Canada Geese have black feet, white belly, white neck, white throat, white breast and white head. The eggs are usually blue in colour with green edges and white spots. The eggs are about the size of a Canadian dime and hatch in about five weeks. The first year that Bill Lishman had Canada Geese he found seventeen birds. Last year he counted twenty-one eggs and twelve young Canada Geese. All the geese that the farmers have been able to find are now over five years old. The geese are very important to the farmers because of the manure that they produce. They need about eight to ten pounds of manure to produce two pounds of manure every day. Geese can live up to eighteen years. Bill Lishman now has seventeen geese and the birds' breeding season is almost over. Bill's brother also owns a farm in the same county as him. On that farm are ten Canada Geese that are also over five years old. The geese have been on that farm for five years. The geese had five hens for food, and the farmer also wanted to give the geese"

The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. Some were as tall as the tallest living bird. Other dinosaurs were only a couple of feet tall. Some were the size of an elephant. There were even a couple of dinosaurs that looked like an entire family of crocodiles. Dinosaurs lived in deserts. Most were covered in vegetation.

His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from the opera. His mother began to teach him the piano when he was six. At seventeen his uncle offered him to stay with him and started to live with the family. In the same year Petrov met and fell in love with Natalia Yevtushenko, a beautiful girl who played piano. On the day of the performance, Petrov and Yevtushenko were on stage and fell in love with each other and were married a year later. After their marriage they had three daughters. - It was in the year of the two-hundred-ninth festival. I remember this day very well. Natalia had arranged everything and invited everyone to see the performance in the evening. We were the last guests at the party. I couldn't get over my memory, that day because I was so happy that I played the piano for the last time. I got nervous, but Natalia didn't have any doubt about my capabilities and was glad about it. The next day when I arrived at the rehearsal hall, my friends and teachers were there too. We began to play, but after five minutes they came and said ""Don't play any more; you're going to play the second piece."" I couldn't understand how can they force me to play such a piece of music. I couldn't play and was very upset. Natalia came up to me and put her hand on my shoulders. We held each other for about three hours; we were in love and in love and we were in love! After that day we went together and continued to play"

He waited for other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. The next morning Serrano looked around the island that saved his life. He saw the wreck where the ship had sunk. He was very happy to see it. But he was not the only one that did. Pedro Serrano was an only person in this island who was able to see it, too. How did that happen?Serrano had a strong belief that every living thing has a soul. He had heard that this island was the source of those souls, which were connected with the other worlds. Because it is a strange and beautiful island, people had never left their soul. This was a place where people could meet again and again to talk and look for their souls.
In the beginning, they found it very hard to believe that they would meet their souls again after some time without seeing them. However, after all the time they waited, they did see. They had the most amazing dreams where they could see and talk with their souls. Even though they knew it was impossible, their heart was very happy when it happened. Serrano was very happy, too. He thought that he should go on and tell these people that they must find their souls now. He wanted them to feel the power of their connection with other souls. This way, he was very happy that he saw this island. Even though he was in terrible condition, he had the most amazing dream. He knew that he must tell his friends about it.
Because they had never been there before, no one knew how to find the island. The next day, Serrano asked"

A2,"There were many big fights at that time. People fought on horses with swords in their hands. The strongest and best knight always won. 'Perhaps the new king will come to the fight' thought the Archbishop. Sir Ector went to the fight with his two sons Sir Kay and young Arthur. Sir Ector was the youngest but he was the best knight in the kingdom. The Archbishop was very worried and anxious about it. As the king arrived he did not look well. Sir Ector had received a blow that broke his arm, but he did not care about it. Sir Kay tried to console him. 'Don't worry, the King is fine, he has only broken his arm. As his arm is very strong it will heal fast. His body is very handsome too and he will be a great king' said the Archbishop. Sir Kay did not think much about the King. He went to the fight and tried to make up with Sir Ector. When they came to the fight the Archbishop said, 'You should go and speak to him, he will have more courage if you speak to him' and Sir Kay thought about it. But he decided that he would only speak to his father. He went to the king and talked to him. The King was angry that he had not come to the fight. 'Well, why did you leave? You could have come with us if you wanted to' he said. 'Father, I did not want to see you so angry. As you know I am not a good king and I should not have broken my promise. I am sorry I have forgotten about you and your family'.' Sir Kay said, 'I think it is very good of you to take responsibility for your family, it is good of you to ask forgiveness"
A2,"A great idea! Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys who grew up in the same small Canadian town. They have always been friends and classmates. Like all their other friends they enjoy going fishing or swimming at weekends. But for the last few months they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is due to a family dispute. Since they work together so much they've decided to start a business. They want to make a business card of some kind and sell it to each other. The last thing they need is money. So they decide to look for an advertising job in their town. Frazer approaches his father, who is a contractor. Peter, however, refuses as he doesn't want to advertise their services. But he still wants to work hard and earn money. The situation is complicated by the fact that their father, like everyone else, has no idea how to advertise their services. That's why they look online. Finally they decide to advertise in the local newspaper, as they think this will be more popular. The article was published in the newspaper and they are very happy with the result. The local newspaper is one of the best-selling newspapers in their town. For almost two weeks now they've been selling their business card online. The card is very expensive: each card costs around $2,000, but they make sure it's worth it! After all, they've spent almost two months working on it. They will soon receive the first orders. The order will be for a million business cards. Their father is very proud of their success. But what will become of them? Who will want to order their card? How much will it cost? And what will happen when the first million cards are sold?They are two very successful 14-year-old"
A2,"'What did you talk about when the ghost was in your room?' asked Wish. 'Did he tell you about his life?' asked Sanderson. We wanted to know more about our friend's visitor. We started to believe Clayton too. It was only a story when he started and Clayton told very good stories. What he said about the ghost being a scientist was true. He told us that, when he was young, he invented many things and he published one book but he lost it and didn't find it again. The next time he had a bad dream and he was the only person who was not dreaming it. However, when he opened his eyes, he saw his grandfather. He asked him why he appeared so suddenly in his dream and why he disappeared after ten minutes. Grandfather told him that it was the way the wind blew and he has been walking for a while and he had some kind of headache. He told him to leave it and go for a bit. Then, he told him, ""Son, I'm going to go."" Wish did not believe him. He asked him, ""Why you go so quickly?"" Clayton said he didn't know why he went. His mother told him not to believe his father. He started to tell us everything that had happened to him and he was very frightened at the end. That night Wish and his friends were very scared and wished there was someone who could protect them from ghosts. They started to play a game called ""Ghost Stare"" to make sure that they would not see any ghosts while sleeping. They played the game for twenty minutes and then Wish fell asleep. He did not hear any noise and when he opened his eyes, the only thing he saw was the wall and the sky. He was about to have some dinner when he felt"
A2,"CROCODILES We can find crocodiles in tropical parts of the world for example Africa South America and Northern Australia. They spend most of the time in slow-moving water but they can move fast through the water and on land. You often see crocodiles together in large groups. They eat everything they catch like fish birds and small animals. These crocodiles are called crocodylians.
LIVE BEARS There are a lot of live bears. Usually these bears live in the tropical zone because there are lots of trees in the forest. Bears in the Arctic, Antarctic and Northern North America are known as Polar Bears. They eat caribou, arctic foxes sea lions, walruses and salmon. These bears have many cubs. They have a large territory.
CROCODILE SPOTTERS These are crocodile fishermen in Australia and other places. They catch crocodiles and take them back to their country. They call them snapper because the crocodiles are a snapper. They use their hands to remove the crocodiles from the water and set it aside. You see crocodiles in the water all the time.
CROCODILE SNAKES Crocodiles have special eyes to see and find their prey. When the crocodiles are in the water they see the water in a big way. Sometimes they can see animals swimming far below and far below. They can smell the food of the crocodiles. This is how they know what to eat. Some of the crocodiles have good eyes and some poor eyes. Some can see better than others. The bad eyes of crocodiles help them to hunt for food. They can catch bigger animals like crocodiles.

A2,"Dear Keira Thank you for your letter. I had my first day at my new school today. A girl called Nicole looked after me and showed me where the classrooms were. She is very nice and I am going to visit her this weekend. My favourite lesson today was Maths and I was happy because I knew more than the other girls. I would recommend this school to anyone because it is well organised and has a nice staff. I am looking forward to my second day tomorrow. Yours faithfully, Laura It was good fun today. I learned a lot about music. It was interesting because we were dancing. My favourite was when we did the first time of the big number. I really liked this dance because we were all doing our favourite song, 'My Funny Valentine' by The Chiffons. It was so good because all of us enjoyed it. I would like to learn the second dance because I liked it so much. I hope you are happy with the letter and I look forward to seeing you soon. Love, Laura It was great to see you again. It was nice to have my lunch together with you and I had a very good time. We went to the ice cream parlour and I tried a chocolate bar which I have never had before. That is what I loved about my day, the ice cream. I am looking forward to the weekend so much. Love, Laura.
Dear Keira I hope you are well and have enjoyed your holiday. I have been reading your letter and am very happy about your arrival at university.

Every morning I took some guns and walked about three miles to my place on the hill. I went and got my things and then I slept, until the next morning. I woke up about 10 minutes later with a great fear and a bad sense of the wind. I could not find the guns. I searched everywhere for them. I searched for 2 days and then I saw one of them behind a pile of rocks, in the water, a hundred metres away. I was absolutely delighted! I went and got the gun, and then I walked three miles back to my house with the best sleep of my life.

They stood and remembered their great friend. ""We will never see our dear friend Jack Skellington again"" the Mayor said. ""This is a very sad day for us all."" Everybody felt very bad but nobody was sadder than the Mayor. ""So we can go to the next town and say goodbye to Jack."" ""Maybe the next town will have a party to celebrate our friend"" the Mayor suggested. ""So we can go to that next town together."" But nobody agreed to go anywhere to celebrate the life of their friend Jack Skellington. The Mayor sighed. He was going to his home and he was not going to wake up tomorrow. ""Jack was a very special boy. He will never be forgotten by our town."" Everybody said this and they all understood. But nobody agreed to go to the next town because they are all very sad. But the Mayor was not going to sleep yet and he was going to talk to his wife. So they were all going to visit him in his house. But when they arrived at his house, they all felt very sad again. ""But I am going to change this mood. I am going to sing to the Mayor. I am going to sing a song to cheer him up."" ""Come on, let's play music in the night. Let's make the mayor happy. Let's play one of our favourite songs."" They all started to sing. But nobody knew what song to sing. The Mayor sighed. He thought for a long time. He thought of a song that he could call to his town. But he could not think of a song. And then he looked at his wife. She had an idea. ""Come on, we are going to listen to a new"
A2,"Then he had a good idea. ""Maybe they'll understand this."" He looked at each of them very carefully and he spoke quietly and slowly. There's a very old man in Christmastown"" Jack said. ""He's big and round with long white hair. His clothes are red and he flies through the night sky in a big red sleigh. He wears a big red sash, and his wife's a beautiful blond. Their son, too, lives in Christmastown. Their other son lives in a house with a red roof. And there's another son, Jack said. ""He's not a red sleigh-driver but he loves Christmas and all that it means. Maybe he can explain what's going on."" The elves looked confused. ""Didn't we already tell you that the old man and his wife were not in the city on Christmas Eve but the red sleigh was flying through the night sky? ""

""Maybe they really are living in a different time zone. Maybe they were born after all."" The children laughed at that. Then they all stood up. ""Well, we've solved the mystery of Christmas Eve!"" Jack said. ""But we better celebrate this."" They danced and sang, telling the story of Christmas. The parents of the children came over later and thanked Jack and his friends for their nice Christmas. They gave him a bottle of milk, an elf's hat and a red sweater, all for Christmas. After Christmas, they all went to the new friend's house, where they stayed all night. But at first the children were afraid of the sky. They looked up and saw a big red rocket flying over their house. It flew very fast, like a spaceship. Then it came back, with lots of gifts, and another rocket for another child. Then all of the children went"
A2,"HOW DO THE IRISH POP-GROUP 'BOYZONE' LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE? Sleeping well is very important. When I can get home to my mother's house I sleep for ten hours. But I find it very difficult to sleep at night after a concert because my head is full of music. Sport is important. I play three times a week with the boys: one week on the tennis court, another week on the bicycle or on the trampoline, and a final week when we go to the soccer or football pitch. It's not an easy task: if you do it you will feel the fatigue. You need a lot of passion and motivation to do it. But then you come out of the pitch feeling energised and you can do something else very interesting. I eat very well. I'm not a foodie. I like to cook a bit, but I don't like eating. I love food! However, I have to eat when I'm hungry because I have a job to do. I only have three meals a day: once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and once at night. I never go to sleep hungry. If I've had food, I've had a good meal. I am a man of a lot of energy! I always try to go out for walks, but there's always something to do. I really love the countryside, so I go on a hike every weekend. I can go on the highest mountain if I have a partner. 
  
 You seem to have a great attitude towards food. How does that work? First, you have to know what you want. You know what you want to eat after two or three songs. So, I know what I'm going to have and what I'm not going to eat."

A2,"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today there are policemen everywhere but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. People from other towns were coming to London to seek employment as well as to steal or rob. The police began to patrol the streets. This is how they started patrolling the streets: They first formed a line, and walked along the streets to look for any suspicious movements. They used dogs and horses to search the streets. After the police found something suspicious, they followed it with the help of their horses. They then walked along the street to look for any people moving from one place to another. They made notes of people’s movements. At night when the police didn’t have to worry about their patrols being interrupted, they could drink. This is how the idea of the London Police was born. In the future, we will all be able to contact the police instantly, without having to wait for hours and hours to be taken to jail. It is not a new idea, but it is still a good idea because it will make the police officers very professional. The policemen, once they have finished their patrols, will sit down on a big table, and talk about the day’s problems. In the afternoon there will be a cocktail party for the officers and their friends. Police officers usually don’t get any extra money when they don’t arrest anyone. If they have to arrest someone, they will probably get a few extra pounds for their trouble. The night patrols will be the most important part of the day. After they have finished their patrols, they"
A2,"There's something out there! It threw an orange at me! Elliott said. ""Ooooo!"" said Tyler a friend of Elliott. ""An orange! Very dangerous!"" Elliott's mom Mary took a light and then she and the boys went into the yard. ""What did you see?"" Mary asked Elliott. ""Something there"" he answered. ""Did it run away?"" Mary asked. ""No. It looked sad. Like it wanted to stay here for a while. So we didn't. We'll bring it back tomorrow."" But tomorrow they didn't go back to the woods. Elliott was alone again, and he walked. He wasn't scared anymore. The sun was rising, and the trees were beginning to stand up tall, almost reaching into the sky. They were almost at the same height as the sky. They were a nice distance apart, but they were touching. That night when Elliot awoke there was something on the pillow next to him. It was an orange! It had fallen on the pillow right beside him and it was still there when he woke up. The orange was a light brown and soft. But when he looked closer at the orange on the pillow, he realized that it wasn't just any orange, it was a light orange. It was really bright, and it had a special glow to it. It was shining like a star in the sky, but just a very small one. ""Come on, Elliott. Let's go for a walk. There must be something in the woods around here."" Mary said. ""Sure,"" Elliott said. ""Let's go."" The tree line turned away from where they'd been walking. ""There it is! Let's go there."" Mary's hands were beginning to tremble. ""Let's find it!"" Elliott yelled. But Mary ran to the woods, while"
A2,"He started walking down to the village. It was difficult because he was very tired. He went carefully because he didn't want to fall again. By the end of the day he was at the river and he stopped for a drink. There were beautiful flowers near the river. 'This is a lovely place' Nunez thought. 'I'd like to spend the rest of my life here. It's as if I'm standing on the edge of paradise.' Then he felt a strong pull towards the earth. 'Who is that pulling me? I can't walk like this! I must be dreaming!' But he realized it was true - he could not continue like this and must get out of the river. Nunez pushed back against the pull and started to fall. It was as if he was falling through the sky and his weight was slowly coming down from the tree. Suddenly a great light came from above him and he saw the mountain. He was in the mountain. He was very happy that there were no more mountains around. Everything was calm. He looked at the sun. It was shining and it was warm. 'What a lucky day today was! I don't even remember how I came to be here.' Suddenly Nunez felt a strange feeling. The weight he was holding was gone and there was an emptiness. He looked at the ground. It was not empty, it was covered with moss and the soft white colour of the flowers. It was an illusion. He realized that he had forgotten to look down. 'It's the same for everyone who goes to the mountains. They forget to look down at all times. Even if they fall, they still feel they are on the ground'. He got up and looked at the river. It was dry and had no green things. 'I want to"
A2,"That night it rained heavily. Mary woke up and could not sleep again. Suddenly she sat up in bed. 'It's that sound again!' she thought. She left her room and walked through the dark house. Sometimes she stopped and listened. She came to a door with a light under it. A strange sound came from inside. She went around the room. It was empty. After a while she got scared and ran back home. She saw that a strange man was living in the house. His face was dark and with an awful look in his eyes. A strange feeling came over her that he was dangerous. She didn't dare to talk to him.
The next day Mary ran home and told her father everything. But no one was home. She had to wait until the next day before she could tell him. Meanwhile, the strange man lived in the house the whole day. He had no neighbours and no one came to the door. Mary was terrified. The man walked around the house. Every time Mary saw him she was frightened. She knew that he was dangerous. Suddenly he walked up to a dark corner. Mary knew that it was too late. The man sat down and stared at her. Suddenly the moonlight illuminated the dark corner. He got frightened and jumped up from his chair. He ran into a window. Mary watched him from the floor. After the man left, the house was quiet. She sat on the floor with her head in her hands.

She thought it was the first time that she had fallen in love. She was not thinking straight. She had no idea how it would end.
Suddenly the phone rang. It was Mary's father and his wife. Mary couldn't answer it. She just stared at the phone for a long time"
A2,Parrots Perhaps you have seen these beautiful birds with their lovely colours and long tails in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil Australia and India. They usually live in large groups and because they like to eat fruit they are sometimes a problem for farmers. They are often kept in small cages so they can eat fruit and eat as many fruit as they like. People buy these birds as pets. They usually come from the zoo or from a pet store. Parrots are usually easy to care for but they are also quite easy to get bored with the same old food. These are good for pet stores because they sell lots of different bird foods for their birds. Many people buy parrots to show off to their friends and other people. Some parrots become famous and are often given to celebrities so that they can have one. Some people buy parrots as pets because they like to talk to them. People have a fascination with the way they talk. They often name their parrots. They often name their parrots after famous people. These kinds of parrots sometimes talk in funny ways. This is a way to amuse themselves. For example they say silly things and make silly sounds. These parrots are very funny and it can be quite entertaining to them. There are quite a few kinds of parrots. This is a summary of parrot facts.

A2,"Curly couldn't attack the other dog because he was very fast. Suddenly he pushed Curly over and she fell on the ground. The other dogs ran at her and Curly barked with pain. But she couldn't stand up and the other dogs attacked her again and again. Buck couldn't move. He was on the ground too. Curly and Buck fought with the other dogs. They went inside and Curly's owner came and took care of them. 
In this story we saw many actions, like running, running, fighting, sleeping, running, fighting. Also, the dogs used a lot of skills that were hard to learn. 
My favorite actions were the sleeping one, because the story had lots of action. Because the story focused on Curly's owner and his dog, I liked how they learned to sleep in the future. Also, the story showed how important a pet is for people and I loved that part. 
I thought the story was well written. It had a lot of action, and I liked how the dogs ran. They were able to do a lot of tricks. Also, the way the dogs woke up, with a special collar, was cute. 
I loved the end of the story. It showed how important it is to learn to sleep. I hope that the author could make more stories like this, and that the dogs would learn to sleep too!Dogs are smart dogs who can use all sorts of tricks. But some dogs, like Curly and Buck, are so smart that they can only sleep! In this story, Curly and Buck get so tired of fighting that they have to get a rest before they can start the next one. 

This story was quite entertaining! It was a really funny"
A2,"There were very old things in the window and Mr Brown liked old things. He went into the shop. 'Good afternoon' said the man in the shop. 'Good afternoon' said Mr Brown. 'Can I look round the shop?' 'Please do.' Mr Brown looked at the things in the shop. He saw an old doll with a sad face. She had a face, he knew, which made people afraid and sad, and she was sad too. 'I don't know who made this doll,' he said to the man. 'Maybe it's someone who's long dead.' 'I think it's just for fun,' said the man. 'But I don't know,' said Mr Brown. The man looked at the doll for a long time and said nothing more. Then he went away from the window. And Mr Brown went home. After all the good things in the shop were gone, he wished for something good. 'I'll have to ask Mrs Brown to look after the baby for a bit until I can go and buy more things.' So Mr Brown went to Mrs Brown. Mrs Brown was watching the baby in the cupboard. 'How are you feeling?' Mr Brown asked. Mrs Brown was scared. 'Not good,' she said. 'What can I do for you?' Mr Brown put his head on the counter and said 'I'd like to buy some new things for the shop.' Mrs Brown nodded. 'You've only got five minutes,' Mr Brown said. Mrs Brown didn't want to miss anything and she said 'Please come back in five minutes.' Mr Brown waited a few minutes, but then Mrs Brown came back out. 'I'm feeling a bit better now,' said Mrs Brown. 'I'll have a look at your cupboard.' Mrs Brown looked in the cupboard, and then she started"

The other day he went to the garden and took his hat and umbrella and went into the garden. He looked at all the flowers and took some for himself and some for Peter. He opened the umbrella and looked at all the birds and the butterflies. He took a bit of a feather for himself and he carried a bit for Peter.
Then he took his hat and umbrella and went into the kitchen. He was so glad that there were two pots on the stove where he had boiled vegetables for dinner and he took two pots to set down. He could eat with the other two pots.
Then he went to the pond and he looked at all the ducks. Then he took the ducks out in the garden and he shot them with a gun. Then he was happy because he had eaten some fish that were in the pots on the stove.
Then he went to the market. There he bought fish for dinner. Then he got up and went to his room and he looked at all the paintings and he took a bit for himself and he looked at all the clocks on the wall and he took a bit for Peter.
Then he took the painting and he was so happy because he had finished all of the paintings.

Then he ran back to his room and he sat on his bed and he read for a long time.

A2,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop age 14 Last summer I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. The people in the front row had to put on an apron and they had to run to and fro the elephant in the middle of the square, carrying it and making it sound good. The animals always behaved well. They walked around, they licked their fans, they walked through the park. There were only 3 elephants, two male and a female, and they were all great friends. The elephant who was the most friendly, the oldest, the biggest and a bit crazy. He was called Udon. He also ate a lot. We always made sure he was fed well. He was in a group of 2 elephants and we were always with him because the other elephants were afraid of him.  He was very sad that he couldn't carry people around because he always ate all the food. He would run like mad to get food. But other elephants would always play with him, just because he would always eat all the food. We all had to laugh a lot and talk a lot because the elephants liked to keep up with us and they would also eat any food we had. When I got up to leave the park, I said to my cousin ""I love you my dear Udon. See you again one day, when all the elephants are gone and you will be the only one left in the world."" She was very upset by that. She said to me ""I'm going to write you a letter telling you how much I love you."" I looked at her and said"

Every man on the ship wanted an answer to that question. Englehorn and Hayes didn't know this way. Hayes and his crew found that out later. But for now, the men and the ship were stuck. In the dark, they had no choice but to wait. Hayes had the lights on in the mess hall, where the men got a little light from the two big lamps hanging from the rafters. The ship was a mess, as they all were. There wasn't much food, except a box full of salt meat. ""How do we get out of here?"" Hayes said. ""There are two ways out, sir,"" Englehorn said. ""There's a rope ladder on the other side of the ship."" Hayes pointed to it, pointing to the dark side of the ship. But Englehorn looked at the starboard side of the ship. They were all in the dark, except for the little lantern Englehorn had on his waist. He wasn't going to risk the dark by climbing down the ladder. He looked toward the nearest anchor, hoping to see the lantern there. The lantern was on the right side of the ship, but they were all still in the dark. ""There's the other way, sir,"" Englehorn said. ""We can climb up the mast on the ship."" Hayes pointed to another rope ladder just up the side of the ship.

B1,"THE ICEHOTEL For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. After a series of feasibility studies, the International Arctic Research Center of the University of Alaska Fairbanks was formed in 1984. The first permanent icebreaker, “Rasputin”, was built by Soviet builder “SKA-NII” in 1985. In 1992 the Russian Arctic Expedition Team (ARET) was formed by the Ministry of Defence of Russia for a long, multi-year expedition in the Arctic Ocean. In 1993 the team became a part of the Arctic Scientific Research Centre (ASRC) of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. A year later, the ARET started its first long-distance expedition with the ship “Akademik Shokalskii” in the summer of 1994. Since then the ARET has carried out various long-distance cruises in the Arctic and other polar seas. These cruises have often proved to be the highlight of the entire trip, as in 1999 the “Arctic Explorer” sailed from New York to Alaska in the first-ever circumnavigation of the North Pole and back. Since then, two further Arctic expeditions have been carried out with the purpose of setting new records for the longest unbroken and unsupported cruise in the world. In 2005 the team set up the icebreaking platform “Aleut” in the Arctic Ocean. After six years of operations the icebreaking platform was decommissioned.

Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. After about 45 minutes up the steep slope to Tower Ridge we got to the foot and we sat in a circle on the snow just waiting for the guide. We stood there watching each other look up at the massive mountain. I have to admit my nerves started to get the better of me. This mountain has been climbing since the late 1950s and the guide told us that it’s considered one of the hardest mountains in the world to climb. It is covered in snow on the top of the ridge and after two hours on the mountain it was too cold to continue. There are few ways to get up this mountain and most people use a rope to get to the top. That’s when it hit me. I wanted to do it with a rope. After two hours of sitting in that freezing circle waiting for the next group to turn up, I had my moment. I was the last one to turn up and I climbed to the top of the mountain. The views from the top are incredible. I was able to get a few pictures that day to add to my collection. I was in heaven. I had completed my first big winter climb. It was a special moment in my life that I will never forget. 
  
 The following day I flew out of Aberdeen and took a coach to Glasgow. I arrived in Glasgow at 3:45 pm. I went to the train station and bought a train ticket. I then went to the bus station to buy a bus"
B1,"Being an older student At 32 I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary although I was earning a reasonable amount of money I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. By the time I entered university I was very much interested in learning something more challenging than waiting for people. Also I realised I was missing my social life. I have only ever worked in an office with two people and I really wanted to make that my life from now on. I enjoy my course and the people I have met in the course. One of the greatest things about university is that it gives you the opportunity to make the right decision for the rest of your life.

B1,"No Title When I injured my back I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. There were women in my area that just wanted to run and not to compete. I decided to run a 5k and I enjoyed running it so much that I then ran a 10k. After that I decided to run a half marathon. 

Now I am running a full marathon. I run in the morning and I run around my apartment building as I take my dog to her crate. I am on my own and sometimes I go a little further than I am comfortable with. I started by running two miles in an hour. Soon I was running at 6 minutes an hour. Now I run about eight miles every three days and I enjoy it. This is just for exercise and having fun but I am not chasing records or anything like that. I enjoy it and I try to do better every time. I would like to go to a Boston marathon one day. It is beautiful to watch. 

I hope to inspire women to be more active and get out and exercise with their families. 

P.S. I am a very healthy person. I eat healthy food every day and I stay away from junk food.
P.P.S. The best advice I can give you is to run for fun but train when you need to. 

I injured my back during the 5K. I couldn't do any other kind of sport for a while but after six months, I started running again. I went back to running and didn't go back"

'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.' The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha who had encouraged other African athletes learnt about Maria. Soon after Jose arranged for a trip to London, and a career in the sport. But despite Maria's success at football she was not allowed to represent Mozambique in the Olympics.

B1,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival an annual nine-day event. The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. It has since become a major annual attraction, attracting hundreds of thousands of people from throughout the United States and internationally. This huge gathering of spectators and participants gives Albuquerque a unique reputation as an international tourist centre. Over 700 helium-filled balloons are released from balloons for all sorts of purposes, including performing tricks such as aerial acrobatics over the crowd. In order to compete with the larger festivals in the United States, the Albuquerque festival has adopted an aggressive promotion strategy to publicize its activities. It also tries to give the appearance of being a relatively safe and pleasant event. The Balloon Fiesta has become an international tourist destination, drawing over 1.4 million visitors annually since its inception. The Balloon Fiesta has attracted more than 40,000 pilots over the years, who fly to Albuquerque to participate in the festival. The festival also promotes Albuquerque to pilots. Ballooning is a skill like any other. Competitors need to have a very high level of skill in order to achieve successful jumps. Albuquerque, like the rest of the United States, has experienced record-breaking levels of hot, sunny weather, making it one of the more popular locations for ballooning. The city was not the ideal site to host this large-scale festival, since balloons in the past have landed with devastating results. There has been a lot of damage due to storms. As a result, several years ago the Albuquerque Balloon festival had to be moved away from the city for several years so that the festival could be held in a better location"

B1,"THE ROCKIES The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America. They start in the North-west but lie only a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies but the best way to see them is to travel by train. The Rockies get their name from the rock formations that line the path of the railway. Each of the mountain ranges is named for its rock formation, and the Rocky Mountains are the second highest mountain range in the world. Although the weather is generally bad at higher altitudes, the scenery along the way is spectacular and it is well worth taking the time to see the Rockies by train if you can. From North Carolina they head east in a series of mountain passes. This section follows the course of the Great River which courses in the Rocky Mountains. Rocky Mountain National Park is situated along the Colorado River. Along the way they also pass through several other beautiful valleys and peaks. Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the greatest mountain parks in the world. Some of the peaks are named after people who have been living there for centuries or have even been buried by the mountains. You can see some of this heritage in the towns on the trail, but most of all you can see this wilderness, where nobody lives but mountains. The railroads in the Rocky Mountains can be traced all the way back to the Colorado River in North Carolina. The Rocky Mountains can seem inaccessible when you are up on the plateau, but you can travel up them in a day or two by train. The main railway runs through the mountains and passes over many small streams, so if you are able to travel from the centre you can take a train to the top. You can also travel by plane in the summer time or in the winter and"
B1,"Little Chefs For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. All children eat all the meals provided and everyone has a chance to talk to the chef. Afterwards there are plenty of chances to taste different food that has been prepared. I was lucky to attend a recent Little Chefs course, so I know exactly how much fun this course is. It is worth every penny and if you are a home cook, this course will make you a better chef. After all, the children are paying for a course so they are getting their money's worth. All children learn how to prepare simple dishes like porridge. In the afternoon they do cooking exercises in small groups to improve their cooking skills. The courses cost £1,240 each, but you don't have to pay anything until they pass the course. But this course isn't just about cooking. It is a great way of raising the kids and introducing them to new experiences, all at a great price! Little Chefs is available at two schools in London and Manchester. I highly recommend this course if you want to teach children how to cook. A friend of mine works at one of the schools and she says the children are just as excited about the weekend course as she is!
The cost of living is getting expensive these days. If your children are eating out more often, you might like to think of an alternative. If your child is hungry, you might like to find some ways to make sure your child is always in a great mood. After all, the child is the future, not the"
B1,"Detective-Inspector Cornish and Chief-Inspector Craddock were discussing the murder at the local police station. 'Mrs Bantry said that Marina Gregg had a ""frozen look""' said Cornish. 'Did she see someone on the stairs? There were two people from America - Ardwyck Fenn and Lola Brewster a film star. They had no luggage and had no passports,' said Craddock. 'The police are searching Ardwyck Fenn's house but so far they have nothing. He could easily fly across the Atlantic if he wanted to escape,' said Craddock. 'But what he did want - and that is what the police want to find out - is that famous painting. And they have the wrong man.' 'Was it on the fourth floor?' 'Yes - and a terrible one it was,' said Craddock. 'As you know Mrs Bantry is not herself - she is terribly unwell. She saw Mr Gregg up the stairs and was surprised that he was alone. She said that he had a sort of frozen look on his face. I believe she saw him with Marina Gregg.' 'And then - the American came down the stairs in his own shoes?' 'Yes - and his shoes were black,' said Craddock. 'She didn't see Fenn's name on the door but she saw a black umbrella - and she said that it came in contact with Mr Gregg's face. He was covered with paint. And Marina said that they were here for a party and suddenly someone shot him from behind. It was a long, long gun shot, which echoed in the room. And Lola Brewster was shot in the chest. It was horrible. Mrs Bantry, whose leg was badly injured, saw Marina's umbrella fly away and fell down. The gunman was dressed in black and with a"
B1,"A few days after this Virginia and her young admirer went out riding in the fields. But a tree tore her riding skirt very badly and when they got home she went up the back stairs to mend it. She was running past the half-open door of one of the rooms when she saw someone inside. It was her Uncle Charles who had come back after a year away visiting his family in New York. It was a very warm day and the house was very light. Uncle Charles smiled and said ""Good morning Mary. How is your riding skirt? Has it not caught on something?"" When she looked at him she was so scared and ashamed and said ""You know Uncle, I was riding in the fields and a tree made my riding skirt very badly."" ""Oh my dear, how awful! I am so sorry you got hurt."" He said he was going to sew the skirt to the boot. ""No Uncle, I am going to change my dress. I have decided to dress very modestly in the future."" She said sadly. ""That is all very well my dear but until we know who is responsible for this dreadful thing, I will not allow you to change your dress. Now I must go to my room and get a better pair of riding boots. Bye."" He said he would return later when he knew the culprit. So she saw him off and he went away into the city. In the meantime Mary went up to her room to change her dress. Soon she heard a sound outside and to her horror it was Uncle Charles. ""Why Mary I am coming to your room now to sew the tear to your riding skirt so we may not have another such disaster."" She said as she turned and ran to the door. ""Don't run away Mary. I am coming right to your"
B1,"Winter Driving Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow waiting to send you off the road. There are so many things that could happen, so a person should be prepared and also know the law. It is very important to understand the laws about the cars in Canada. There are some things that only can be done on roadways that are not protected by ice. There is only one way to be prepared. The most important thing is to study the laws and know what is the best thing to do. If a person has a car with special equipment he or she will have a better chance of avoiding an accident and having a good time. This is an excellent way to enjoy the winter and spend time with friends and family. It will also be cheaper than going to the skiing resort. It is important to be aware of the law. It is illegal to operate on the ice without the appropriate equipment for an emergency. One should drive only at low speed on a dry road with a snowplow behind him or her. They should never go on the ice alone because they are more likely to get stuck and lose control. If you do not understand the rules of the road or the risks involved, you can get a ticket and your driver's license can be suspended. It is not the only possible result, but there are others. If a person does not have any knowledge about the laws of the road or how to avoid a danger he or she can face serious consequences. If he or she was only paying attention to the weather and the traffic signals, he or she could also face the consequences."

B1,"The next day Emma was pleased to see a lot of snow outside. This was a good thing because it meant she could not go to church and see Mr Elton or go to visit Harriet and none of them could meet. The snow stayed for several days after Christmas and the only visitor to Hartfield was Mr Knightley. “Mr Knightley, I want to tell you about my past. The night I was attacked by Emma we were at home. Emma was upstairs and I was downstairs. She had been badly bruised. I told her I was feeling unwell and she asked if I wanted tea. I said yes but she did not like the sound of it. She asked if I could go upstairs for a minute. I went upstairs and she went to the bathroom and after a few minutes she came downstairs. She started to wash her hair but then she became ill and went upstairs. I think she had a cold. It got worse, she was very unwell and said she was dying. I ran downstairs and asked you to bring tea. I had not told you Emma was upstairs when I came downstairs because I knew she would kill me if I did. I got the tea and I put it on the table, she went downstairs and took a needle and a glass of water. I had not seen her take a glass of water before, I am afraid. After she left I went into the bedroom and lay down on the bed and died. You may think that was a bad way to go but it was what I had to do. The reason I wanted to die was that Emma was going to kill me. I was about to give the evidence that she was responsible for my death to the policeman and all hell would have broken loose. I did not want her to get away with murder. I just wanted"

B1,"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST Hypatia was born in Alexandria in Egypt in 370 A.D. For many centuries she was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books. Hypatia's father was director of Alexandria University and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual as most women then had few opportunities to study. As a teenager, Hypatia began studying anatomy and the physical laws that governed nature. These were her real passions, however, and she devoted herself to them. As the years passed, the Egyptians began to open up to women's studies and the first women were students at the University of Thebes. Hypatia studied for five years before the university director forced her to leave to become a teacher. In 406 she married the astronomer and mathematician Eratosthenes and the couple had several children. He died in 399 B.C. and she became a recluse and a recluse only. In 305 B.C. Hypatia married the pharmacist and astrologer Diagoras, who lived in her town. During their marriage he often traveled with her and she traveled on his ship to Delphi to make a pilgrimage to the shrine of Apollo, then a huge god to all the Greek people. He died in 297. In 293 B.C. she wrote her famous ""Theophraston,"" an account of one man's life and the time he spent in the wilderness. Hypatia became a teacher in Alexandria and was a great teacher in her day. She lectured at the university, at the church and at the palace. For many years she was married to the astronomer and mathematician Coponos. During one of her trips to the Delphian Temple she discovered Uranus. While traveling through the desert she saw a strange shape that made her realize it"
B1,"Joining the Kirov Ballet I’m Nathalie. Last year I was one of the youngest foreign students ever to join the Kirov’s ballet school in St Petersburg Russia. At my first ballet class I was nervous as I didn’t know anyone. Everyone gathered round asking me questions all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. Now that I am part of the Ballet School the atmosphere is very different. Everyone from across the world comes to study ballet. Everyone that comes from abroad knows the Kirov Ballet. It is always a highlight of our summer for us. In the summer there are three schools in Kirov that do classical ballet, modern and contemporary dance. These schools are the Kirov Ballet School, the Mariinsky Theatre School and the Theatre of World Performance. It is a very prestigious school and every student who is part of the school has the best of everything. We are all taught by master teachers, and we receive a lot of extra training at home. All of the students in the Kirov get the best education possible. We also have opportunities to travel around Russia. At the end of the school year we get to perform at the Moscow State Conservatory. The music we study at the conservatory also helps us to compose and perform classical music. This is a huge opportunity to perform at such an incredible place like Moscow State. It is a huge honour to get to go there! The Russian people and culture is so unique. It is an amazing experience for me to be in the Kirov for the first time. I have been on tours with a Russian ballet company before but the Kirov Ballet school takes my performance to another level. I also love the theatre in St Petersburg.

B1,"Norwich Norwich the capital of the part of Britain known as East Anglia has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years. It began as a small village beside the River Wensum. At the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 it had grown to become one of the largest towns in England. Norwich's medieval history was distinguished by the large number of religious houses, but also by its many mercantile organisations. It became a centre of learning with a university being founded. Norwich was taken by the English after the Norman conquest and became part of the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1204. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the Saxon people of the county fell under the control of the Danish King, Suthbert. After King Harold was killed, King Suthbert decided to make Norfolk an independent county. He then rebuilt the fort of Burnt Wood to keep Norfolk safe from English attacks, but was defeated at the Battle of Leyden in October of the same year. After the Viking invasion of England in 998, Norwich was captured by King Óland of Norway, who forced the inhabitants to convert to Christianity. In 1197 King John took Norwich by force, but was repulsed by the Danish king, Håkon VII Æthelweard. Norwich was the first place in England to hold a church service celebrating Christmas. It is still the first Christian city to hold its services on December 25. In 1438 Norwich entered the English Civil War, but was able to retain its liberties under the protection of the King's Armies during the winter. In May of that year, Norwich was attacked by the rebels. In a dramatic struggle between the townspeople and the rebels, which lasted two days, the townspeople managed to repel the"
B1,"Sharks  Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Shark attacks are very rare, but occasionally they occur. People go on safaris where they see sharks, but they don’t need to worry about shark attacks. Shark attacks usually occur in areas where people tend to swim and go fishing in the oceans. Sharks have no defense against the fishing nets that are used on many oceans, so these attacks are very common. There are many types of sharks, the largest of which are known as bull sharks. They can grow up to over 25 feet long and weigh over 15,000 pounds. Sharks don’t usually attack people, but when they do people usually survive because sharks are very strong. Bull sharks, for example, have an average attack strength of about 120 pounds per square inch. This means if you were standing next to this shark, it would take nearly 100 pounds of force to kill you. Bull sharks are not very common in North America, so most people haven’t seen them. It is estimated there are only 10 bull sharks in the entire world. Another type of shark, the hammerhead shark, can grow up to about 20 feet long and weigh about 7,500 pounds. It is rare to see a hammerhead shark in the ocean, but it is said to be one of the most dangerous sharks to humans, especially when it comes to a shark attack. Shark attacks can happen anywhere, but most of the time they occur on islands, beaches, or on ships or boats. Sharks are very scared of people,"
B1,"Sweden's Ice Hotel The village of Jukkasjarvi is in Swedish Lapland and winter temperatures there can reach -40° C. But 6000 holidaymakers still go there annually to visit what is probably Europe's most unusual accommodation. In this hotel you eat drink and sleep in rooms made of ice. If you want you can even get married in one. The first guest had booked the hotel for a wedding but the minister ended up getting married himself in the same facility. The ice hotel was designed by architects Carl Östenlund and Lars Ullenhag in the 1970s in a remote part of Lapland. Its popularity grew during the 1980s and became the most lucrative hotel in Lapland. It now has almost 20 locations in Sweden. More info about Hotel Ice.

B1,"CARTOON FILMS Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something you can make it move on the cinema screen. The use of new ideas and advanced computer programs means that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. This wasn't true, of course, but it had become what it was. In the 1990s there was an attempt to turn cartoons back into movies and with the help of the internet, computer graphics and DVD-R's, this has been achieved. The cartoons are now so high-quality they could be almost any genre. Cartoons can be funny or emotional, romantic or dark, they can be about friendship, loyalty or love, they can be scary, action-packed and exciting, they can be cute and cuddly or they can be terrifying. They have changed completely. The film industry knows how to make a cartoon; it is only a matter of finding the best directors, actors, writers and animators who know how to make a cartoon. A cartoonist has to be a master of drawing and an excellent editor. It is not easy to do both. So, the cartoons should be funny, entertaining, emotional, imaginative and most important, well-written. If you know how to make cartoons, you will probably be the best person to make films of your own ideas. Your imagination will take you on a fantastic journey that will make people want to see them again and again. It is true that you won't get rich, but money isn't everything. You will love what you do.

B1,"No Title The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six"" says Margaret Porter a violinist and music teacher. ""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret who lives in London prefers to take pupils at three and four although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. Porter who has been teaching children for 25 years said: ""The most important thing is to show them the joy of music and that it's not about performance or being a star."" She said there were three stages in a child's musical education. A child learns to play the violin in the first year in a group of six students who take turns to play in front of their teacher. By the fifth grade, children who excel in the classroom are rewarded with private lessons with their favourite violinists. Porter said there is nothing wrong with starting a child's musical education at age four as there are many activities that young children can do at that age, such as singing, drawing, dancing and playing with children's toys. ""At four a child can play with their toys and make up their own stories or play games."" Porter added that children who are very good in a music class will have an easier time at primary school as they are seen as more confident at that stage. ""They learn about the notes and how to read music,"" she said. Porter, who is also a senior columnist for the Telegraph, said it is important to teach children how to read music by singing together and by writing letters to their favourite music stars. ""Children can also learn to play along with their favourite artists on their computers,"" she added. Porter said there are a few differences in how children learn in the United States and the United Kingdom and she said one of the key differences was that in America children learn to read from"

B1,"SAMUEL PEPYS The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting description of everyday life in England between 1660 and 1669. Pepys writes about important news stories of the time like disease an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames and the Great Fire of London. Also, Pepys was a chronicler of his family life, the time he lived in, his wife and children. Also, he wrote of the news from abroad. He used the diary as a record of his thoughts and feelings. It became very famous and influential in the literary world of England. Also, he died in 1692 and was buried at the church of St. Paul’s, London. He was survived by his wife Mary and their sons Samuel Jr. and Thomas. It was published in 1694. The two parts of this diary were titled The Morning and The Evening. The Morning part was written on the 3rd day of the month, the 3rd of September. The Morning part covers the events of the previous month. For example, in the month of September the diary says that the king was defeated at the Battle of Hastings. He also mentions that his queen was beheaded at the Tower. Also, he mentions a fight that took place between his son Thomas and the Queen’s steward. The event that takes place is the Battle of Hastings. The evening part is written on the 28th day of the month, the 28th of September. The Evening part covers the events of the previous month. For example, he mentions that the queen died on the 13th of September and that his son Thomas and his steward were killed at the battle of Worcester. Pepys mentions his son’s death and it is not clear whether he had married"
B1,"The History of Shoes In the past importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today but other materials such as silk plastic or cotton are also popular depending on what is in fashion. 
Shoes are usually made up of several layers of flexible and lightweight material and usually covered in a thin layer of canvas. Each foot has a thin layer of tissue made up of skin which grows new tissue over time called corns. Shoes can be made from animal or human skin or from materials such as feathers animal skins etc. Although people used to tie their ankles with cloth they have now learned how to tie their shoes with laces. Shoes were originally made for walking not just running. 
Foot coverings were originally made from animal skins but leather has become popular as it is strong, waterproof, lightweight and can last for a lifetime. Foot coverings used to be made from a variety of materials but today the most popular materials used are leather, suede, suede leather and faux fur. 
Wearing leather shoes today is popular for men and women and can be casual or formal depending on the occasion. Leather can be made of cow, sheep, goat or a mix of all these. Leather can also be made by hand which adds to its authenticity and originality. Leather is extremely durable but is less comfortable than other materials.

Shoes are worn on your feet throughout the day and can be worn casually or formally depending on what type of occasion it is.  Shoe laces were originally made from a plant and leather laces were later discovered and made by hand. However, because leather laces are very strong and durable laces can still be made by"
B1,"The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the ‘famous Ghan’ which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known above all for being late. The journey across the Australian mainland takes four days and is considered by many to be one of the greatest train journeys of all time. The train takes its name from the Northern Territory’s Ghan Valley. The Ghan Valley is where the train crosses the South Australian desert. The name originated in the late 19th century when travellers on the railway would say ‘we’ve arrived at the Ghan Valley’ to refer to the journey across the country. The name is currently used on a number of Ghan Valley tours with the aim of introducing people to the place. The Ghan Valley is the third longest continuous railway line in the world and the second longest in Australia. The length is measured along its entire length and includes branches in Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia. The line crosses the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the ‘famous Ghan’, which is perhaps unfortunate, since it is known above all for being late.

B1,"Henry Ford Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863 but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen he began work as a mechanic and in 1893 he built his first car. After he had driven it 1500 kilometres he sold it and built two bigger cars. Ford had four cars in total, two Model A's and two Model T's. This is why he became famous. His most famous car is the Model T, a one-wheel, five-wheeled automobile. It was first produced in 1901 and it has only been manufactured since 1913. Since he used only American parts, it was also the most affordable car in the world for normal citizens. He could make only 4500 copies of the car in 1903. The car is now considered to be one of the most famous inventions in history. It was also the first automobile to be adapted for use in extreme weather conditions. In 1937, when he was ninety-eight, he began producing a new car, the F-1, but it was destroyed in World War II. The car that he produced in 1940 was a four-wheel motor with an enclosed transmission and four wheels. This is why he became known as ""The Model T King of the Road"". He later made three other cars, the Model A1, the Model A2 and the Model S. As far as I know, there are only 6 Model T's that still remain in existence. One of these models is currently sold by Ford of America. The Model T is the only car in history that is regarded as a mass-production success. It is also, probably, the most expensive car in the world. Because of this, there is a great demand to see the car from a real life perspective. When you think"
B1,"Atlantic College Last week I went to visit Atlantic College an excellent private college in Wales. Unusually it gives young people much needed experience of life outside the classroom as well as the opportunity to study for their exams. The students who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world spend the morning studying. They are then given an opportunity to visit the college and get a feel for it before the start of term. After a few hours of teaching time, the students are given time off to explore the college. Their next class is at 12pm and they then spend the rest of the afternoon in free time. In some colleges you would pay to spend one day at school, but not at Atlantic College. The school, founded by the Brothers of Saint Augustine in 1870, offers an excellent combination of faith and education in a friendly and friendly atmosphere. I am sure you will enjoy it.
In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token ""|||||"". Your task is to summarize them.It's a public high school in New Zealand but it doesn't cost anything. Instead, students go through a long summer term at the school. They take all their exams in January, but their final results are announced in July. If their teacher isn't pleased with their exam results, they're taken out for tea. In the summer, the students have to keep themselves busy. They go out on a scholarship for cultural trips, to visit the ruins of Pompeii or to look at the famous landscape of the Welsh countryside. The students stay on campus after school, learning about life in the real world and spending time doing fun things with friends, all while they're working hard for their next academic year.

B1,"No Title A month ago I had no idea that on a Saturday afternoon in November I'd be hanging 30 metres above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me and realised why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The only other climbers in the place were four friends of ours, Kevin, Simon, Mark and Andy. We soon agreed that it would be great to join them on the Saturday and go for a session. The Activities Centre at Bury St Edmunds was one of the biggest rock climbing venues in Suffolk. It was huge! The main obstacle was that we were on a Saturday so there was only limited climbing and a limited number of people taking part. It was perfect for us. We met our friends for a meal and drinks and we then headed over to the Activity Centre. Kevin was the one who had invited us, so the first thing he told us was that we were all going to climb on the same pitch. Matt was nervous and excited at the same time. Kevin went first. He did a great job but he'd need to do it again the next day, while Simon tried to get the hang of it, then he was just as good. It was a struggle! But I've now done some great rock-climbing and I've never wanted to get down from a wall ever since. And Kevin? He went on next. He was nervous, too. I think he did pretty well until he fell from the wall into the river below. I was beside myself. We jumped over the fences and went to help him out. But of course the first thing we did when we got to the water was swim. We did this for around 30 minutes and then Kevin went back"

There were lots of special offers including a leather sofa on sale for £45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). The report claims that the shop was packed full of customers. After the first hour the queues were so long people were being forced out the door. The owners had hoped to sell 10,000 pieces of furniture by the end of its first day. The furniture is available by appointment. It seems the opening is a success. 'We will be back for more,' said a sales assistant. 'This is the best day ever. It's so crowded you can't move, the crowds just have to know.' 'I'll go to the next one,' said a customer, who would not give his name. 'You have to earn a living. I was just a kid when this shop opened and now I'm buying the house.'

'We were told by the council to close at midnight,' said a sales manager. 'You have been warned. We will open again at 6 tomorrow.' A spokesman for the council said that the shopping centre management had been advised by their licensing officer not to open the store after 6 am.

B1,The Eden Project Since it opened the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK’s most popular tourist attractions. At first sight the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. The biospheres are also the perfect backdrop for some spectacular water features in the middle of the lake. In the centre of the lake there is the Eden Rock that stands proud above the water like a giant rock castle. At the foot of the rock is the Eden Visitor Centre. From here it is just a short walk into the biospheres to enter the hot spring and steam bath. There is a children’s play area on the edge of the hot spring. The main attraction though is the Eden Project itself. The biospheres cover more than one square kilometre and give a 360 degree view of the lake and landscape. The first attraction is the ‘Eden Project Café’. This restaurant is located in the centre of the biosphere. It offers a large menu with plenty of food options. If you are lucky enough to arrive at lunchtime the restaurant becomes fully booked but for a great tasting meal the best time is from 3 p.m. until 6 p.m. The café is open daily to allow visitors the chance to see the biospheres before heading off to their next attraction. At the visitor’s centre there is the Eden Visitor Centre. This is the ticket office where you can buy tickets for a variety of activities. In the mornings and evenings the kitchen is open to provide food for the visitors and staff. It offers visitors a variety of meals all cooked on the spot in the biosphere. There is also a children’

Each band had their own costumes ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly-coloured T-shirts. I have always been interested in jazz music, especially my school band’s tunes. I’ve played the trumpet for years but this is my first time competing, so I was really excited about playing at the concert. I went to the competition with my dad, and we performed with the band. I had never performed before but everyone enjoyed it – even though we were up against some great bands! We performed three sets: a Jazz Quintet, a Jazz Orchestra, and the Jazz Combo. We had a great time playing. We started playing at 5pm and were done by 7pm. The Jazz Festival is such a big event, it’s great to see our town coming together to celebrate.

B1,"San Francisco San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it was discovered by land rather than by sea. The city is located near the bay and surrounded by hills. Many famous writers and artists such as Mark Twain and William Faulkner have called the city home. San Francisco is known for many things, including its great food, wide variety of restaurants and nightlife. The city is also home to the annual Golden Gate Fairs. It is well known as a cosmopolitan city and has many attractions. There is also a huge Chinese population and they make up one of the largest religions in America. San Francisco is an important hub for the shipping and transportation industry in North America. It is home to the world headquarters for many companies. One of its most famous companies is Amazon, which has had an office in the city since 2009. It is a centre for film production. There are two major film studios - One of America's oldest is the City of London. It is home to a number of historical buildings, including the Bank of London, which was the first bank in the British Isles to be granted a charter by the King in the 13th century. This building is now used to display artifacts from the British Empire. You can also visit the Royal Mile, which is a street in the city centre. This road was opened in the 19th century and is now lined with many shops. The Royal Opera House, located on the side of the bay is a famous place to visit in the city. Also, the Golden Gate Theatre, and the Theatre of Eternal Love are both very popular. The city"
B1,"STAMP COLLECTING - IT’S A HOBBY THAT CAN GROW AND GROW Millions of people of all ages enjoy a hobby which is both interesting and fun. And every year more and more people start a stamp collection of their own and discover an interest which can last a lifetime. Starting your collection is easy because stamps are everywhere. When you buy a stamp, you are not just buying an ordinary envelope, or even an ordinary piece of paper, but you are acquiring a piece of history, and history will always be there for you, if you are careful. The history of stamps, as well as those of the world, can only be enjoyed by people who are enthusiastic about stamps. It takes a very special stamp to be a collector. The earliest modern stamp, dating back to 1793, was in fact a “foolscap” (an engraving of a picture), which showed a family portrait of King George II and his wife Catherine in front of the Royal Mint. A stamp which shows the Royal Mint and the family on the first page can be found in many collections. But the most valuable stamp collection, and the oldest, belongs to the holders of the Royal Mail Service (RMS) stamps, as this stamp was first issued in 1863. The RMS stamps are issued yearly and are issued at the beginning of April each year, except during a summer holiday. They have a fixed price of 5 shillings. The stamps are printed at the Royal Mail printing works in London. To collect stamps, you must have a good memory, as each and every stamp has to be named and noted in a special notebook, which is kept in your stamp box. As soon as you receive a stamp, you must jot down its name immediately. Later, you may look through your stamp collection to"

B1,"New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role 'I never expected to spend some of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I’d only ever acted at school but I'd loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her. In fact, I was so determined I wrote a play on her life and auditioned for the part. It was a little frustrating for the first few months as I wasn’t given much to do and there was talk of me leaving the show. But, it was all to change during a meeting with the head writer. He asked me if I wanted to audition for the part of Polly again, only this time, I wouldn’t give up on my dream. He told me this was the only chance I'd ever get to play Polly again. As if reading my mind, he said he’d only cast the role if I accepted the offer. Now, a year later I am so very grateful to have the chance to portray the character I was born to play.' 'I'm thrilled that I've been given this opportunity to do the role I've long wanted to play. I have great respect for my grandmother and am very proud of my great great-grandmother, Polly Finnegan. It was a privilege to have her as a grandmother and to have written a show around her incredible story. 'Polly was a pioneer in her time and I love that I'm able to use her story to show how a family can be broken apart by differences. I hope people will see the characters in the play and see them as real people who had to face real issues.' 'I first read the book at the age of seven and fell in love with the story of"
B1,"Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car recycling wine bottles not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out. I want to be clear about one thing right from the start - it wasn't my idea to become the BBC's ethical man. Nor my plan to become a 'living' ethical man. That would be an oxymoron, wouldn't it? 'Ethical' has its roots in Christian ethical principles, which describe how we should treat our fellow man. Some ethical principles involve helping others and being ethical, others are more altruistic - such as 'do what is best for others, even if that means that you have to compromise something for your own benefit.'. I'm just one of the millions of ethical men who's been inspired by Christian ethics to try to improve the world - and make it a better place to live in. And the BBC wanted to help me make a difference, so they invited me to do some research. They also wanted me to find the ethical man in each of us - because they believe that's what makes the whole world work. So I gathered people together and asked them how they lived by ethical principles - and I discovered that not only can you follow Christian ethical principles but you can become an ethical man on your own. The BBC wanted me to find an ethical man in everyone, so they invited each one of us to nominate a friend. From then on, it was just a case of finding someone who could share our ideas and get them into action - and they didn't ask me to be part of an advisory board - they asked me to do the job! I asked my friends to do the same, so together we began this challenge. We all asked a couple of friends to join"
B1,"We went to the park. We knew of fifty-two sons in prison. We made a circle of lights one for each son. People stopped to look at the dancing lights and came to ask about our campaign. By the time it was dark our camp had grown to more than fifty women. They made a circle of lights fifty-three for each son. People stopped to look at the lights and asked about our campaign. By the time it was dark our camp had grown to more than fifty women. They made a circle of lights fifty-three for each son. We stood there smiling. In the distance, the moon rose above the trees, and the sky grew orange. It was beautiful. At last, I said, ""I know your dreams have all been stolen away, but I know the light has been stolen, too. I will make a promise that the light will never, ever be taken from you again."" We went our separate ways. But the next morning, I got the same idea I did twenty years before. It was like a dream, just like the first time. I had seen fifty-two of my sons. I stood in the circle of lights that night and I said the same thing I had said in the first time. But now I had to be sure, so I looked up into the night sky and I pointed to the moon. We all smiled and said, ""Forget it."" But tonight we were going to make a mistake. We knew we could never make a mistake like that again. We started talking about what to do. But then I was not sure. I felt like I was playing a game, and I was very close to running out of time. So I turned to the last idea I had. I pointed to the stars"

B1,"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod which means 'far distant place'. The first race of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race was held on March 15, 1909. The Iditarod began in a small community called Willowdale in far northern Alaska. After this race the race was officially named the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The original prize money was $5000. It is now an amazing $20 million dollars. After the first race the Iditarod became a national treasure and was often referred to as the 'Great American Race' It is considered the last great race on earth. There is only one winner and every year when the race is run the winner is the one who has traveled the farthest. The only way to win the Iditarod is by driving a sled from Alaska to the North Pole, without stopping! As time passed the race has become so well known and well celebrated that people no longer travel from all over the world in order to attend the race. The people now travel by plane and train from all over the world in order to see this great race. Every year for two years the race is covered in white snow, but every year the winner is still the one who has traveled the farthest! This year the record for fastest dogs on the trail was set by a dog named Susie, a Norwegian sled dog, who reached the North Pole, in 1:29:18 on her first time trying the race. The next three dogs that came through the finish line finished behind Susie. First came Mike the"
B1,"No Title When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976 my only object was to earn enough to feed my children. Today 'The Body Shop' is an international company rapidly growing all around the world. In the years since we began I have learned a lot. In today’s world we are in such a mess with our health, our beauty, our food, our homes and our environment that to keep things clean I must do what I can to look after myself. But as I was saying, we must be responsible for our own health, our beauty and our environment. As a result of these lessons I now work hard for a healthy future. To find the cure for cancer, for diabetes, for depression, to make our hair, skin and teeth young and bright, and to find a way out of the environmental crisis - this is the aim of my business, the hope that drives me each day to make this world a better place. My motto is ""a clean, healthy and beautiful world is a beautiful world!"". But I am not the only body and beauty business in the world. Many body businesses exist in many countries all over the world. They are all the same, however, in each country they are owned by a particular person. In our shop, at the top of the main street, we have a beautiful sign. We don't advertise ourselves any more than anyone else does. We only make what our customers want. The idea is that people should know where they can find us. But that doesn't mean we need to advertise. When they want to buy body products, they will come to us. I think this kind of business is better. If I advertise I will lose my charm. No one can know me, and I"
B1,"Rock Band Two years agoour 14-year-old s onBen asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At firstwe were very much against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time' Ben argued ’and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end we gave in. So, there you have it. 'I can't be bothered!' he wailed. But he wasn't. A week later he was playing in the garage like a pro. He'd even mastered the 'Rockin' Walk' - a song that took me seven years to achieve in Rock Band. 'It's just not like doing something more productive,' Ben complained, but I said it was a great way to pass the time. And so began our friendship. 'I always wanted to be a pro drummer,' he proudly told me last week. And so I'll teach him what he needs to do. 'I'm not good enough to play rock music on stage,' he conceded,'so you'll have to teach me that.' 
  
 After the two years of playing and growing up together, you might think I had an idea of what he needed to learn - not so. But after playing together, he surprised me again and again. Not with just one song, but with two or three. And I was stunned. I was learning faster than he was learning. The next thing you know we were jamming. We played for four hours that first weekend and never stopped. I taught him how to play each song I knew, and he taught me new ones. The more I played and listened, the more I knew myself and what I liked. We practiced twice a day every day. 
  
 But I didn't realize that it was only the"

In 2003 Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath and come back up to the top without help. She became the first person to ever free-dive for 120 metres, but says she only does it ""because it's something that I always wanted to do and that I am really good at."" Since then, she has made free-diving a tradition. Nowadays, the sport is not popular on the island of Barbados and is not taken seriously, but Tanya says she will keep on doing it, because she loves it. ""I think my passion is what I do. I do it for myself. My passion is what I love. I think I would be a bad sportsman and a bad person if I didn't do it."" She also thinks her record-breaking attempt on the first anniversary of her world record attempt showed the public that she was not being a selfish diver. ""To know that we did it together, everyone watching the live, everyone who was behind us in the stands. It shows that this is what we wanted to do. That is what we could do. Everyone that was supporting us, I was so happy."" Photo: AFP ""It's because I love it. There is something that we all have in common. We all love the water. We all love to be close to the water.

B1,"ZOOS People began to keep animals in zoos over 3000 years ago when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally. The zoo animals are often seen as part of their culture and are often the symbol of the zoo. Some zoos have special events during the whole year. The zoo animals often have a great deal of freedom and can be seen behaving naturally. The zoo is an ideal place for children and also for the elderly who are bored and can spend their time in the zoo. Many zoos use animals with unique personalities which are interesting to people. This is one of the best things about zoos - animals are often seen behaving in a different way than we could expect them to. Animal enclosures can have a special effect on the people. Many people who go to zoos find themselves feeling a kind of magic because they find animals to be fascinating. The zoo is a kind of place where people can spend some time in a relaxing way. Zoo people like to spend time with their animal friends and talk to them. It is also interesting to see how the animals live their lives and show that they are like us. The zoo is a good way to spend some free time and to enjoy the fact that animals are different. People who visit a zoo are often given interesting facts about animals which are not normally revealed in books. People in zoos are often given books about animals to read. People love to chat with animal keepers and animal keepers are keen to know the answers to the questions asked by visitors.
Zoos are important parts of our lives. Most of us think that there are different animals in"
B1,"MONEY What is money? The pound the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book a huge bag of sweets or a couple of cinema tickets. A dollar bill may buy an oil change or some food. The Australian dollar, the euro or the yen are also like this. The problem is you can't change it for something else. There is an exchange rate in the middle. What you are currently spending on money is what you are getting back for it. There may be a difference of one hundred to one but most of the time it is less than that. For example if you have an Australian dollar or a British pound in your pocket you are paying for a ticket to London but you don't have to pay much money. So it may be worth one pound to you but only a penny to the store clerk. How is that possible? Your dollar is worth exactly what you are currently spending it on. That's the exchange rate. If you change it for a dollar it is only changing it for the same amount of money. What is the exchange rate? How do they get it? It is calculated by a bank. The bank is paid a fee for allowing the exchange. The bank charges you less for its services if it has already exchanged for you what you wanted. This fee is called a swap rate. A pound costs around £0.50 (A US dollar) so the bank would be exchanging £0.50 for the pound. The bank gets a fixed fee for this service. So if you want to exchange your money for one US dollar it will cost £0.50. It also costs a small fee to the"

It’s an amazing place as the builders have used wood for the whole thing just like in our old school but it’s also one of the first in my country designed to be really environmentally friendly. There’s plenty of room for the children to learn and I’m sure they’ll do really well. Anna had her first day at primary school and, to say she was overwhelmed, would be an understatement! She was really happy to learn and play with the other children. She’s going to do very well there and we’re all really looking forward to taking her to school for the first time on the 6th of January. We can’t wait to see her at her new school.

B1,"The Skywalk The Grand Canyon in the United States was created by the River Colorado. People visit the Grand Canyon Park to go walking and running but mainly to look at the view. It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 metres.
The Skywalk is considered to be the most scenic viewing platform at the Grand Canyon. There are different types of walkways that are used to go across the Canyon. The main and easiest one is the Skywalk. This walkway is located at the southern point of the Grand Canyon. The walk begins from the viewpoint point at the Skywalk and ends at the bottom of the canyon. Skywalk is an open sky walkway made by the river and its beautiful waterfalls and cliffs. At the top of the Skywalk is a wonderful view of the river.
The route of this walk is an easy one because there is no trail in the middle of the Grand Canyon. This walk is not as strenuous as you may expect. People who want to enjoy the scenic view of the Grand Canyon and its beautiful scenery love it.
The Skywalk is one of the best ways to view the Grand Canyon. People who have seen it, have told how amazing it was. Skywalk is now open all year round. There are different times when you can visit it. During spring and summer, you can visit in the afternoons or in the mornings. This is the only time that the Skywalk is closed. You can visit the Skywalk from April through December. You can go there in the mornings or at lunchtime.
If you are wondering when you can visit Skywalk this year, the answer is April - December.

It doesn’t happen frequently and when it does the city’s water pipes can’t manage the sudden floods which turn the streets into rivers. But as many winters have remained dry in recent times when the rain does come it is welcomed by the local people. Because drought is a permanent threat. The area is particularly prone to fire. At present Morocco is facing a serious drought. To help people the government has distributed water canons and water-saving projects to villages. The government is trying to increase the supply of water to the country. But even if they succeed they are unlikely to be able to stop the recurrent drought.

B1,"Gareth Ellis Gareth Ellis 13 is the youngest son of Alan an engineer and Kath a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers but Gareth's dream was always to become a clown. Three years ago Alan Kath and Gareth joined the circus. 'People laugh when we tell them' says Kath. 'The circus doesn't just perform tricks and stunts, it is full of people with real feelings. The circus is a great way to make friends and learn to act as an adult. Circus training is the same as learning to swim - you have to be patient and try new things.' The circus also provides a new life for Alan who has been unemployed for a number of years. Gareth is now working hard and is helping his brothers with his clowning skills. His parents believe that 'the circus offers Gareth a fantastic chance to develop the skills he has always wanted and help his family and friends. 'We are all very proud of him. He is very brave and a great future clown.' Gareth is planning on starting the clown training in three weeks' time. He will train by performing tricks with a rubber ball. The ball will be changed and he will learn new tricks using different items. He will also do other things to improve his clowning and teaching abilities. 'I will learn as much about clowning as I can and I want to be the best clown in the whole world.' Gareth was in charge of the circus' costume shop and has been working in the costume department for the past two years. He is an enthusiastic buyer and has helped to source costumes. He is always on the look out for interesting costumes and always keeps an eye out for bargains. 'He always has something new in his dresser and he is always in demand, telling everyone he knows about great bargains."
B1,"Little Chefs For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. They do not have to wait a few months like others do when they become unemployed.
The Chefs, trained by an experienced teacher, work at the Children’s home (formerly care homes) in the evenings, preparing lunch for all the children in a variety of recipes, most made with ingredients grown or bought locally. The local community help to buy the ingredients. This saves both money and time for the volunteers who spend the whole day in the kitchen.
For example, over the three weeks they are in the care home, the children prepare a vegetarian pot-luck lunch on Sunday for the staff who are present. It is an opportunity for the children to develop their skills and taste different flavours, all of which will be kept in the children’s mind as they go away to become chefs of the future.
The Chefs started as a pilot project and now their members have formed a self-relying network of chefs. They plan and cook at least twice a month for several hundred people. All food is sold and all income goes into helping the Children’s home. If enough people support it, they plan to build a restaurant which can provide high-quality food and accommodation for several hundred children who will grow up not knowing how to cook.
In the meantime, they have made a positive impression on young and old, who all hope to be a future chef too.

B1,"HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It consists of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. Honey bees live in the flower pollinating every day from sunrise to sunset.
10. The honey from a bee's nest contains a honeycombed comb of glands called a nectarine comb.: Honey comb is a honeycomb structure made of glands, called nectarine glands, called nectaries. These glands are located within a special layer on the outer covering of the comb called a honey veil. The nectaries are usually formed by a set of glands in the middle of the comb that produce a sticky liquid called honey. The glands are surrounded by the honey veil, which can be held closed by honey and/or wax. Nectaries and honey provide a unique honey scent. Honey can also contain pollen, wax, enzymes and other beneficial organisms.

To produce honey, bees extract nectar and pollen from flowers. Nectar and pollen are usually collected at sunrise or sunset on a warm day.
The pollen or nectar collected by bees is stored in the nectary glands. This is typically found in a nectar-producing bee. 
The nectar from flowers is not collected. Instead, it is processed and converted into honey.
11. Bees need to feed their young before they reproduce.: Bees feed their young with nectar and pollen. The young take a mixture of nectar and pollen. They collect nectar and pollen in special nectar sacs that are located in the bee's beak, called the operculum.

B1,"No Title Some people have complained about this year's collection New Writing 3 although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is pretty amazing? Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Nonfiction - with some exceptions - is less worthwhile. A good deal of the book is taken up by interviews with writers. While this is useful for introducing the work to the public, in practice the interviews are rather weak and the writer rarely gets the opportunity to say what they mean by their work. Writing - whether fiction or nonfiction - should give an opportunity to express your point of view so it is disappointing to see such weak writing in the collected works. My favourite story is the first one which gives the readers a wonderful insight into the inner workings of some very famous and influential people in a very short and revealing story. I particularly enjoyed how this author describes the life of the world famous music manager and artist Michael Jackson. A number of this year's best-selling books are reviewed on a separate page. Other books which have been good include: How to Write a Book (by Hilary Mantel) and An Adventure for Henry Ford: A History (by Steven Pressfield). The latter offers an interesting insight into how the man at the centre of our history made his mark. A few non-fiction books - on the subject of football, war and other things - also feature. The section on history in the new collections is well laid out and gives a good opportunity for learning and exploring the way in which we understand the past.

'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio then to press previews all before lunch. Then it was time to work. On my desk were a couple of photos – one of me and the other one of the two women next to me. On my left side was a drawer where I placed my uniform, along with a lipstick tube, some pens, my ID card and my passport. My manager said I was to turn up at a certain time, so I'd put a message in my e-mail about getting there early. I also had to wear makeup, so I decided I should wear a dark pink lipstick and some blue mascara. I wasn't a big fan of my uniform because I always wore a green cardigan and skinny jeans, but I had to do this. I wanted to show that it wasn't just men in the office and I wanted to look different. On top of this, I was wearing a red scarf to cover my hair.' She shrugged and went on. 'I was working on the cover of Marie Claire's September/October 2006 issue. I was just about to go into the meeting of the editorial staff when my phone rang. It was a man called Mark who was the sales manager of the magazine and who I'd never met. I didn't know what to do. It looked like the magazine was going to go to a digital edition and I didn't want the magazine to get lost in the new format. I was concerned that the man I'd never met would be in charge of sales.

B2,"Onto a winner Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse two bushy-bearded brothers in their forties are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico USA and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces.
It was their childhood game as well. It was ""Rook & Key"", a popular and highly popular game that has been passed from father to son for decades. It was one of those childhood games that every kid was excited to show his friends. Rook & Key was made by the popular children's toy company ""Eddies"". The main character was the Rook, a knight with a red hat with a golden staff, and the Key to open the castle was the Key with the white ball inside, which also appeared in the original Eddies Rook and Key game.
The brothers started this game back in their own home while their younger sister was visiting. Their mother had made a small board with the holes on both sides of the wooden pieces. Dave started with the Rook, then Norm started with the King, while the younger Dave started with the Knight. It was a very popular game.
The brothers started the game by placing the Rook on the board, with the white ball between two holes on both sides, at the center. They then started the game with the Knight. They moved their King one space to the left and the Rook one space to the right. The game was now completed.
After finishing the game, the brothers kept this board as souvenirs. Over the years, the brothers had visited the town of Santa Fe and stayed in a hotel near the famous Plaza de Armas. They would visit the Board & Card Shop that is located"
B2,"Then his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships' lights shone. The moon in its first quarter hung over the hill to the west and the stars were clear and bright. Five minutes later Dr Kemp pulled down the window again and returned to his writing desk. He was not so happy now. He had heard the captain complaining about the storm. If the captain spoke his mind too strongly, then there was a danger that it would spread. And if the captain spoke too strongly, then his ship would not see the light of day for a long while. And if his ship did not see the light of day for a long while, then the men who worked on her would be even more unhappy than they were at present. He decided to listen to Captain MacIntyre, the ship's master. He was sure that he would know what to do, and so he began by asking him where the wind was blowing. The captain's head swivelled quickly from right to left, and he replied briskly, ""It's blowing hard to the north, from west to east."" ""And the ship? The ship is not moving?"" ""No, it isn't. But she is protected by the ropes that are wound round the mast, and so she isn't moving on the wind."" Dr Kemp paused for breath. ""What about the sails?"" The captain's face darkened. ""There's no sail at all,"" he said, ""because the wind has blown all the way to London. And it's blowing straight at us."" ""Well then,"" said Dr Kemp, ""you can let go the ship's ropes. The ropes are strong, and with a little help you will all be all right."" The captain turned away again. ""Maybe,"""
B2,"Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers fear that the 36000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so [line 6: beginning] rapidly that they will not survive for future generations.

""Careless tourists"" are not the cause of this destruction. If anything, they are making it worse. They are taking away pieces of rock, damaging them, and then placing them in their cars to take them home. There's no system in place to remove the pictures once removed. There is no system in place to protect them from being damaged further on their journey.
[line 7: beginning] But the real culprits are the tourists who drive around picking up rock samples on their way up. Rock art experts are beginning to recognize certain sequences in the rock art. It's hard to be upset at tourists who visit a site and are happy to see the art that made that site famous. It's human nature to want to see art, no matter where it is located. But it also seems to me to be very difficult to preserve art when you have people who are just driving around trying to pick up rock samples, even though it is illegal to do so in certain places in the park. In this particular case, rock samples were found on the way up to the paintings. It seems to me that someone was driving around to find samples of rock that were on display, without realizing that they might pick up pieces of the art on the way.
[line 8: beginning] It is a little bit of a Catch-22. A lot of people in the tourist industry would like to preserve the art. But they also need to maintain what is a well-known"
B2,"We are being bombarded with advertisements all the time and a lot of them are targeted at young people. Smaller children apart from spending their own pocket money can also influence what their parents buy so many TV ads are created with kids in mind. For example adverts for drinks feature cartoon animals. 
Advertising is considered good because we’re used to seeing advertisements everywhere and they’re used to help sell products to us. 
When it comes to television commercials they are just one aspect of an advertising campaign. Another way of advertising is using social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat to promote products. This type of advertising is considered even more effective because young people find social media useful for their studies. So, it’s natural that advertisements would become a source of entertainment, a good way to get the message across and generate a buzz. 
When we’re on the Internet we see advertisements everywhere. We might not like them, but we’re used to it. We might even get used to the way advertisements are presented in different ways. For example when using an app or website. For example, the adverts on an  app show you a certain song or restaurant, the adverts on the website show you more details about the adverts on the page, and so on. These kinds of ads might get annoying, but they’re still a part of modern technology. 
In the next article, we’ll look at the benefits of television. The aim of the article is to demonstrate that all of the advertisements seen on television are there to sell products and services.

B2,"No Title Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place that often worked. And so you did, and when you showed up there was a bed in a hotel that said something about ""Bed and Breakfast"" in huge gold letters on the door, with the words ""no night check"" in blue chalk outline. But not for very long. 
  
 Then you had the hotel. But it seemed that your best and safest bet was in finding someone who had worked at the hotel and had a flat that they had left behind to find someone else. You looked carefully at the advertisements for guest houses, guest rooms, holiday apartments, student halls. And then one day there just appeared on the screen ""House for sale. Large 4-bedroom flat. 2 bathrooms. Room available for rent now."" And so you went to the advert and went round asking if anyone knew a guy who might have a flat for rent, and they knew a guy who knew the guy. And so on and so on, up to a room in a house, with an outdoor patio that a guy had rented for his two dogs, which was also available for rent. And then when you went home you had a room with a kitchen table and two chairs and maybe a couch or two. 
  
 I found the house by personal contact, which is the only way I know of, because the advertisements and the letters and the television news coverage simply didn't reach people who were looking for a flat. There was always one or two people in the hotel who had some spare room"
B2,"Interview Tips First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress our eye contact our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words. So how can we turn this negative first impression on our favor?
1. Smile. It's something many of us struggle with. But having a smile on your face will convey confidence, warmth, and warmth will get us a positive response.

Smile more. Smiling is contagious!

Make eye contact. Look them straight in the eyes and maintain eye contact. Eye contact helps us to project confidence in our personality.
2. Make your hair look nice. Your hair is important too! If you've let it become frizzy or damaged you're going to have a negative first impression. If it's straight and tied back, you'll have a welcoming look. Try and leave your hair alone and let it have the freedom to do what it wants to do.

Look for a great hairstyle. Some men and women get their look from hairstyle such as the one in the picture. Try to follow a similar hairstyle.
You could consider using a product such as styling paste or hairspray to keep your hair from frizzing so it doesn't look greasy in a new situation.
Try to keep your clothing neat. Avoid wearing baggy clothing that is a distraction. Try to stay in fitted clothes that show off your shape or your waist.
3. Practice your smile. Practice smiling on strangers. This will make you more confident and friendly as you come into a meeting.

Practice smiling by telling jokes and making fun of"

People looked at them and wondered if this event was connected in any way with the paragraph in the morning's paper. The Countess Marie had been startled. She had been standing on stage for only a few seconds and at first had not realized what had happened. At that moment the orchestra had played the last notes of the programme and the last audience members had left the theatre. The Countess Marie looked towards the stage, where the actors and actresses were dressed in their costumes. Who is responsible for the theft?The Countess Marie was startled, but realized what had happened too late. She had, therefore, no time to think or to explain. In front of her, the theatre was empty, because the audience, who were all going back home, had already left. The Countess Marie, in her dressing-room, had no chance to talk to Raoul. When the actors and actresses had taken their places for the first rehearsal of the next day she had returned to her dressing-room. There, after changing into her costume, she had felt the knife in her pocket, but had not realized what had happened, until, at that moment, the orchestra had finished the programme, and the last audience had left the theatre. The Countess Marie had therefore not been able to inform Raoul that what he had seen on the stage the previous night was actually just a performance. She had, however, known that he was troubled and she had taken him under her care. I repeat the statement of the Countess Marie, in her dressing-room, to the constable of the theatre at the"
B2,"Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. We admire them in the sea and gaze at them on TV. They are a symbol of health and happiness. But behind the dolphin's smile is a bleak future. Their populations are declining at an unprecedented rate. Around the world, there are between three and five million dolphins. The average size is just over 20ft (6 metres). But today their numbers are less than one million. There are many reasons why. For starters, the food industry has overgrazed dolphins. One in five are now dependent on fishing for their livelihood. This puts them at high risk of injury or death from being hooked. They can even be shot by poachers. Scientists believe the dolphin may become extinct in the next 10 years. In addition, diseases like human immunodeficiency virus and bovine spongiform encephalopathy are wiping out dolphins. Some species have virtually no genes left to help them resist diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which threatens a third of their population in the Amazon. In Brazil, where BSE has taken hold, about 40% of all dolphins have the disease. The cause of this is a combination of climate change and pollution. The dolphins are pushed into the river by cattle or driven to the coastline by palm oil palm plantations. There they are washed up on the shore. As a result, their population is growing, which in turn means more conflict with humans.

B2,"Over the past fifteen years my research has documented that for many online life and smartphone connections have got in the way of things that people feel are important. We're so busy communicating that we don't have time to think we don't have time to sit down and have a conversation. So the online world gets in the way of talking to people. We're trying to talk to people more because we are so addicted to talking to each other than we are to the real world. What we should really be talking about is ourselves.

We are constantly looking for others to talk to but the truth is that we don't talk to others as often as we talk to ourselves. The smartphone is an easy place to meet people, it can be found in almost every public place and it is very portable. We don't have to make a conscious effort to find someone to speak to but instead it comes automatically.   It makes it so easy to meet new people that we forget how important it is to have people to talk to. We don't even make an effort to look for someone we want to talk to so our friends aren't there when we need them.    I think it has gotten to the point where  we have so much electronic life that we no longer recognize that we need to spend time with ourselves. It takes us so long to process information and to get information that we no longer know how to look to ourselves. The Internet has become so important to us that we now have no time to think of the importance of sitting down and having a conversation with someone who we actually like or who we don't have to talk to. We're so busy finding ways to make our lives online that we forget how important the real world is.

The queen asked him if he had forgotten who he was speaking to. 'Oh!' replied Hamlet. 'I wish I could forget. My father has had no son. He was in this kingdom, but for a month, when I was a boy. As he was a King, I must obey the laws, if I wish to continue in this kingdom.' 'And you obey me?' inquired the queen. 'I obey you because your father was the king who ruled Denmark. I have no wish to be king of this one.' 'What!' interrupted the queen. 'I have no wish to be queen of any kingdom. Who am I to be in your opinion the real king?' 'As you are the queen, you are the only person in this kingdom who can be the true king,' replied Hamlet. The queen then asked, 'I have seen your mother, what did you think of her?' 'She was a great queen, but I never liked her. There were always too many people in the kingdom for my liking and she was selfish and unjust, for she wanted to rule this kingdom for her own sake, not that of her subjects.' The queen then asked Hamlet if he thought that he would be better off as king than he was as queen. 'Not really,' replied the prince. 'I am tired of being king. I would rather be queen of all the Denmark's than king of any one. For I have made a kingdom for my mother and my father, just as they would for themselves. If I am to remain the prince of this kingdom, then I have only one choice. I"

I'm up at 6.00am each day but am usually home by 8.30am. There's no staff to help me get everything ready so it's the first thing I have to do in the morning. It takes me a couple of hours to set up the business as well as get everything ready for the day. 'It's also not easy to keep on top of everything.

B2,"Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves. In On the Origin of Species published in 1859 Darwin described the process of natural selection. The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. This process occurs as the population gets larger and larger, which leads to higher fitness. Eventually the fittest, or most genetically 'fit' animals, have evolved - and there you have it. The theory is now one of the best established scientific theories and there are countless articles and books devoted to its application to all aspects of society. It's widely believed to be a major influence on the development of human culture. A classic illustration of this is the many depictions of animals which are thought to have been drawn based on observation of Darwin himself - such as the elephant from the illustrations in The Origin of Species, and the turtle from The Descent of Man. But does it need to be? In this talk we'll examine a few key myths about evolution and the theory of natural selection. We'll examine the fact that most evolutionary theories were based on'sketch diagrams' to help students understand the concept, and then we'll look at some of the other explanations that have been suggested in the last few decades. And we'll examine the idea that'some' evolution is a consequence of selection, rather than the cause of evolution. It is worth emphasising that these are just theories based on observations and some studies have suggested that selection alone could not have led to the diversity in human behaviour. A full analysis of the idea is beyond the scope of this lecture, however. We'll also look at the controversy surrounding Darwin's comments about the morality of Darwinism and whether 'evolutionary science'"

It's a large house by the sea not far from the village of Ardbeag. It was always very romantic and we spent the weeks building the most wonderful holiday. One year I woke up in the middle of the night, in the middle of my dreams, to the sound of a horse and cart running. I opened my eyes to discover a man running after it. We always found our horses in the grounds. We were soon able to settle down for the night. Once, on my birthday, my brothers went on a horse and cart ride round the grounds, down the hill, and back to the lodge for a cup of tea. I decided to stay behind and wait for them in the lodge. A few days later they brought up my birthday cake. But I couldn't eat it. I had been in the dreams for so long I was starting to see things. It was like the cakes weren't my own. I had no control over what was happening, except when I opened my eyes. As a result, I had a terrible headache all night long. I told my brothers that I was going to take the train back to London. We started our journey at four in the morning. We were due at the Dublin terminus at midnight. But when we arrived we found that the train had broken down. It was in the middle of the country, a few miles outside the city, and the police were closed off for the Easter weekend. We stood in the station for more than five hours. In the end we decided to walk, but only to the next train station"

High above them on the climbing wall hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. 

Climbing competitions are judged by a panel of judges and Lombard is facing off against 17 other top contenders. 
  
 But Lombard has the advantage of speed and experience. 
  
 His climbing skills are amazing. He is the second man in history to climb all 7 Summits - climbing each one at least twice and summiting the highest peak on every continent except Antarctica. 
  
 But Lombard has a reputation for an edge. He is also known for a vicious reputation. 
  
 He became known for his aggressive fighting style. He once knocked a fellow competitor from the air with a big punch. 
  
 Lombard's team-mate is Australian Mark Beaumont. He is considered the best ever climber on the World Cup circuit. He had to retire from competition early this year because of a hip injury but has now picked up his climb. 
  
 Beaumont said: ""We're going up this wall a lot faster than Francois is going. We've just got to be able to find a way to catch him."" 
  
 But Lombard has found another way to try and beat him - he's taking the lead in the race. 
  
 At the end of the final climb in 2009, Lombard was the world champion with a time of 22min 45sec.

But now it was not the world's only network of computers. After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful other networks began to appear. For the first time two of these networks were connected to each other by the Internet. This network was called the Internet and it is the network most used by the people today. It is composed of thousands of computers all over the world. It is possible to use a computer by connecting it to the Internet. The network has three main parts. The first one is the Internet itself. The second is the many networks that have access to it. The third is the many private networks of people who want to communicate with each other without the Internet. Now it was possible to communicate just by sending an e-mail. In this way people were free to send each other messages at the time that the message was most convenient for them. But the most important point of the network was the availability of a wide range of services. Most of the people of the world live in a small city where there is no Internet. But there are many people around the world who have computers and are connected to the Internet. Now everyone has a chance to have Internet access from anywhere in the world. This way of communication has two advantages. The first one is the ability to communicate with many people at the same time. This is the reason for the explosion of the Internet today. The second advantage is the opportunity of working from home without a problem. This is why the Internet is used by many people today and not just by computer specialists. There is a great number of opportunities on the Internet today. Everyone can become a writer by

His long legs were almost six feet tall. He looked like an Olympic gymnast. Now, at twenty-two, he’s still almost a foot taller than the average man. ‘I want to be the next big thing. I’m going to Hollywood.’ The problem is, he hasn’t landed a single part yet. He auditioned for one role. And that was the end of his acting career. Chris Greener is now a producer. He has written several films and has a television series on BBC1. His latest script, ‘Sink or Swim’, was shown on the BBC2 documentary series ‘Made in Britain’. It was made by a student crew from the University of Salford and starred Chris Greener, John Farrow and Tom Fletcher. The show was filmed in the summer of 2005 and was released to cinemas in the autumn. Chris spent the better part of the next two years trying to get the film accepted for the 2006 New York Film Festival - an achievement no one had done before. To get there, he had to convince more than 120 financiers that his film deserved to go to the Oscar ceremony. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn’t think so - and that’s why he doesn’t know when he’ll hear a response from producers for ‘Sink or Swim’. But he doesn’t seem to mind too much. �"

But now he had another chance, thanks to a man who was ready to turn his life around. Gary had changed his life and started a new business selling meals to prisons, under the name Gary's Cafe. He had also changed his name. He had turned his old name into a new name, that was more professional. And then he had found a friend in John.

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch a 24-year-old from West Sussex. This is her second year as a chalet girl for St. Christopher's House, a four-star hotel in St. Moritz, Switzerland. This year, as in years before, she has done a great job of keeping the chalets and the people who stay in them happy. She is an attractive young woman. There is nothing particularly unusual about her. What sets her apart is her cheerful attitude. In her chalet she has two rooms – one for her dormitory and one for the room she spends most of her time in. There is even a little kitchen on her floor. The work she does is the same for both: she is in charge of tidying the dormitory and of the kitchen. The cooks come to her for advice. Her roommate is a 24-year-old man from London. He is a very good cook and the dormitory is kept in the best possible condition. But neither of them is a chalet girl and they are perfectly happy. One of their roommates is a 23-year-old woman from the Netherlands. She is a talented singer but she has other interests, too. There is a little pool outside the dormitory and she spends much of her time there singing. The other roommate is a 27-year-old man from England who speaks English and French well. He works in a small shop and lives in a house just outside the city of Saint Moritz. He also sings but is a terrible dancer."

Nearly fifteen years later nobody has beaten that time. Have we got to the human speed limit? Dr Frances Ashcroft Professor of Physiology at Oxford University explains the limits of the human body during a race.We all knew it: the human body is a strange beast. If it was a car, it would be a big engine, capable of great speeds, but without safety equipment or much oversight. If it were a machine, it would probably be the fastest, safest, and most efficient machine on the planet, and still might not be fast enough. If it was a living thing, it would probably be one of the slowest, if not the slowest creature in the universe, because all the cells would be asleep. And even those cells would sleep when they were tired.

I have always known that the body is a weird animal: I have always tried to stay healthy; the old “Eat, sleep, exercise” adage has served me well over the years. I have always known there are limits to how fast it can go (for example, even a 400-lb gorilla could not reach the speed of light when on all fours) and that they could not be exceeded (the limits have been set well before Einstein published his theory of relativity). But now, as a scientist and a physician, I am having trouble understanding how my body works. Why does it produce the incredible feats of endurance it does? Why does it make the amazing runs of the world-class athletes? When I try to understand my body’s limits, I am frustrated and confused. It seems so clear to me how the body works and what it will not tolerate, but"

I'm always in a rush to finish shopping so I can start shopping again. So that's why I'm always behind!

Please give me a mail if you like my ideas. I want to hear from you.It's easy to forget that shopping is part of life, as well as eating and sleeping.

It is full of her favourite flowers most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. The iridescent green-blue poppies often give a feeling of magic. The colours are very delicate and shimmer like fairy dust over the water in the garden. In the winter there is just a whisper of colour on the branches of the trees and over the rocks. Sometimes the water turns blue from the light on the grass. When the sun is shining the flowers are bright pink in the late morning as the sun hits the pink flowers before the water has a chance to reach the surface. When it does the pink water sparkles. The late afternoon is a very special time as the petals fall from the flower in a beautiful cloud. This is my favourite part of the day to photograph as the sun reaches the petals. If you live in London you should come and visit the garden. You will be delighted with the many beautiful flowers and will feel inspired by the colours and light.

Ask anyone to think of a famous TV cook and writer and it's frequently Delia Smith's name that comes to mind. Delia was a star of the BBC's ""The Great British Bake Off"" from 1996-2007, where she was an established name as well as an ardent cookbook writer. As the show went on to become the UK's longest-running cooking show, Smith started publishing her recipes in the early 2000s. The title ""Delia Smith: 100 Best Recipes"" was a bestseller and a BBC cookbook of the same name followed in 2010. Smith has gone on to write several cookbooks and is currently publishing one every year or so. These have been well received on a widespread level in both the UK and US, and Delia is still the number one selling cookbook author in the UK. (More than double the number of her second place rival Julia Child, according to a 2007 BBC survey.) The original ""100 Best Recipes"" also spawned numerous offshoots, with the most popular being ""100 Best Bakes,"" ""100 Best Fries"" and ""100 Best Salad."" These have sold around 10 million copies to date, while the more recent ""100 Best Classics,"" and ""100 Best Flavors"" have also become bestsellers, in the UK and US respectively. There is also ""Delia's Master Chef"" series, with series 1-10 currently in production.

Now he was sure that this rule applied to radio! He was tired and it was time to sleep. At eleven the phone rang. A voice said: ""Hello, this is the news. What news has happened?"" ""Nothing!"" Jake said. But in this case he was wrong. Two minutes later the television news came on with a full story about the Hailey verdict. Five minutes later Jake's TV turned on again with news about the tragic death of a young musician named Jimi. Then he realized that all of this news was part of the same story. He felt even more bored. At twelve the phone rang. He opened the door to see the television. Five minutes ago it showed two women talking about the Hailey verdict. A tearful young woman was looking down at the floor and sobbing uncontrollably. Behind them was a very bored policeman. ""What are you staring at?"" Jake asked. The policeman said: ""I don't know what you are talking about. Do you have the latest news?"" ""Yes, I have the latest news,"" said Jake, annoyed by the police officer's interruption. Jake heard a phone ringing on the wall"
B2,"Week after week British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people’s privacy and break the newspaper editors’ code of practice. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion this is not typical. More usually great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page.
The statement is valid.
As well as being a well-known tabloid newspaper the News of the World is also, as it is widely held, the British tabloid press, which was founded, as a rival to The Sun which was founded in 1821, a little earlier. Both have always claimed to be more “transparent” than the other.
But how does one separate the tabloid press from the true tabloid press in a sea of paparazzi shots? That question can be asked in terms of journalistic ethics as well as personal ethics.
The tabloids are run by newspaper editors who, according to their editorial guidelines, are to keep their news gathering activities and reporting activities to a minimum.
This is not always done, but often it is not done to the extent that some photographs that appear in the tabloids or are on the web could be considered as “confidential” (they are not publicly available on the web). The editors of the newspapers that publish the tabloids have an understanding between themselves to publish only those images that are not yet publicly available.
I am aware that sometimes there are photographs of celebrities that are published in their private life which could only be published in private and which are not published on any other news media other than their tabloids. For example, a photograph of Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio kissing in the garden of Jennifer Lawrence’s parents home might only have been published in one tabloid newspaper, but could"

The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them. There was new furniture and Paul had a teacher. He was really going to Eton his father's school in the following autumn. The five thousand was supposed to cover everything. Paul and Oscar did not speak for several weeks, then they met again and Paul explained everything. Oscar was not angry at all; the children were not only going to go to Eton, but to be the best they could. He had taken them to the best private tutor and the result was spectacular: Paul had scored a 9 on a new exam at Eton and he was going to be captain next year. That was his only chance. He told his mother he wanted to get married, but his father had said that Oscar's mother must attend the wedding only to act as a best man. But that was enough for Oscar. He was delighted with his son, who had become a great man. He would never have it any other way. Who is the thief?The fact is that it was actually Paul's father who signed the agreement, not Uncle Oscar. Paul's father had promised Oscar to provide for him a suitable school, one which is considered to be the most prestigious in England. As a reward, he was to be able to send his son to Eton. But the very next day, Paul's father returned from London with a whole different idea.

As the result of an accident, Paul had lost his job as a taxi driver. He was therefore in a terrible situation: to support his family, he would have to sell off his family home and live off the money his father had promised him. Paul's father"

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch a 24-year-old from West Sussex. “The first year I had no idea what I was doing. I was trying to learn the language! This year I feel I’ve got my feet on the ground,” she says. This year she is in charge of all the catering at the B&B in the French alps – for the three chalet owners and 40 guests. “Last year it was all me, and I made a really good success of it. I do all the baking – breads, buns, cakes. I like to make a good impression on my guests,” says Sarah. Her father is English and her mother is French, so she has a bilingual background from a young age. “My mum likes to bake, so that was always part of my family’s life. But my dad’s in charge of the restaurant in Brighton so I have to manage that in here,” she laughs. For her parents, the holiday-making season is a happy one. “When we went to Switzerland and France, the weather wasn’t as bad as it can be now – but when we get the first snow in Brighton you realise how cold it is in winter. It’s all about having that sense of adventure – which is what we’re all doing on holiday. It’s great that it’s not all about going to a big resort or to some fancy hotel. Everyone can stay in"

When I met her she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. The team had recently returned from a pre-season tour to China. Their aim was to stay fit and in shape for the forthcoming World Championship, to be played next month in South Africa. The team is made up of players from other sports who are interested in playing netball. For many it is their first experience of netball and they're looking forward to using their new-found skills. For some they've been playing for nearly 30 years, they've all won bronze and silver medals. ""As well as having fantastic ability, netballers are hard working and committed,"" explains captain Slowinski. ""We want to win a medal at the World Championships. ""We don't just play for fun. It's our job to represent our country and the sport."" Netballers make excellent captaincy candidates. They're experienced, they understand their role and the impact it has in the team's performance, and they have the right attitude. In Suzie Ellis, I met someone who was committed to her sport, her team-mates, and the country that supported her. The Netball Captain ""I started playing netball in my mid-teens, it was an after school activity at a local community centre,"" explains Slowinski.

B2,"ICE SKATING Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill. The first skates, made out of wood, are known to have been made during the time of the Viking period. Around the year 1000 a group of Danish skaters set out on a voyage to the New World. They called it the “Denmark of the Indies”. They sailed from Copenhagen to New Orleans. Today it is thought that most of the skaters today are from Denmark. As time passed, the popularity of skating declined. The first modern skates made of iron, in the form of iron skates, was used on ice in the 19th century. In the early 20th century the interest in ice skating returned to Scandinavia. There has been a strong demand for skates ever since. There are many manufacturers, especially in Scandinavia, who make all kinds of wooden skates. For those who prefer a softer and more flexible style of skating, steel skates are often used. The skates in the metal shop are not made from metal but rather from alloy. Skates made of iron are more hard and can do their work even without a handle or grips. Skate shops can provide skates for various levels of skaters, from novice to professional. There is also a wide variety of brands. If you are interested in purchasing a skates in Europe, it may be worthwhile to visit a few different shops. At a shop, you can look at different brands and prices. It is also possible to buy a used or new skates online."

When I met her she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. The women's sport, once so frowned upon, has found huge public support, especially in the last few years. The England captain, Kendra Slawinski, a 34-year-old former student of the University of Sheffield, is passionate about women's sport. ""If we had 100,000 young girls coming through our doors, women's sport would be a vital part of their lives,"" she says. Last month, Slawinski was one of four captains chosen to represent the British women's squad in the 2016 European Championship. The tournament is in Spain in September and Slawinski, a former England squad member and current coaching staff member, will be her country's captain. ""I'm lucky enough to be a squad captain,"" she explains. ""It's a great honour."" But in a sport where gender is still highly problematic, Slawinski knows the challenge ahead. ""Women have the lowest participation rates in the team. It's something I have to get our girls to think about, and as captains, I have to talk to them about."" The squad will face off against Spain, Germany and France. ""It's a tough group,"" she says. ""We're in good shape, though, but we want to keep it that way."" She admits that the team's success is not driven by players. ""We're lucky to have two or three superstars, and a lot of great players in our team, but it's the strength of the team as a whole"

Hi,

I'm a high school student in the UK. 
I don't know much about your particular problem but I have a few thoughts that I feel would work best for you. 
First of all, it would give you a great excuse to go to the gym and have a few body-weight exercises.  
Secondly, it would give you a lot of self-confidence. 
Thirdly, you'd have a great chance of meeting someone that might like the same kind of sport as you. 

Here are some suggestions on how to get it done.

Swim in the morning or in the afternoon if it's warm.
Get a bike and try to find an urban cycling path for running in your town or country.
Take a long bike ride to train.
Run/walk when it's not too cold.I'd definitely work on your strength/body conditioning!
You could also join a local sports club, and then you don't have to be around ""dirtbags"" or ""douchebags"" or people that are going to tell you to ""get in shape.""

She has edited the magazine for more than five years and has an excellent record of finding publishers for writers. Here she gives her advice. 
I have a book proposal which I am now getting to grips with. I have been accepted by a publishers for my book on British art called British Design. I have some research work to do, but I know what they want and how they expect it to look. I am worried that the style I want will clash with the publisher. It's not for them to tell me what I should or should not do, but rather to advise me on how to go about making my book look good. Are there any specific things I should do? And if so, what should I avoid? And also what should I include to make it sound like a full book and not just a pamphlet?First of all, it sounds as though you have done some research. You have identified a topic and a market that you are interested in writing about. Good.
Now the question is, will your writing about the topic of British Design satisfy the requirements of the publisher? Will you be able to provide a good product that meets those needs? 
The most important thing is to make sure that the book is good quality. If you can do this, then any publisher will happily take on the task. However, if you make a bad copy"

On the desk there was a map of the firm, one wall was taken up by a large shelf with many books on taxes. Avery had spent many years working at the firm and as Mitch suspected he kept his work place spotless. Avery's office was dark as he put the map on the wall and put the desk open on the top of the shelf. ""Avery, come here. We're going to talk business."" Avery turned and looked at Mitch. ""What's your business?"" ""I'm gonna get that job with that IRS man. It's payin' too good to pass up."" ""Why do you want to work for him?"" ""If I do it, then you'll have an opening."" ""Maybe.""

B2,"Film Critic Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing - novels for other newspapers films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That all led to writing for The Front Page. Back then I started out by reviewing, but quickly moved to writing feature film reports. A year later we became a film blog in which I now review films for The Front Page. I began reviewing independently, but found that it was getting harder and harder to attract the attention of film magazines (especially ones that were focused on new movies). Then, in 2006, we came up with the idea of a film blog, and the rest is history. The blog has grown from a one person operation to a group of six individuals all of whom contribute their opinion and write about the films we watch on a weekly basis.
If you have never heard of The Front Page, it is a local daily newspaper. I reviewed for them for a year and a half and have fond memories of the time spent there. Most recently I was writing feature film reviews for them, but this has now come to an end as of today. It will always be a part of my memory, but now I have other things to do. The blog will be running in its place.
What is it about reviews that make them so enjoyable? When you are done you can sit back and reflect upon what a review meant to you, what you thought about the film itself and what you liked or disliked about it. In a way it is also like a conversation with someone you respect or just someone you would like to know better, so it is also an ideal way to spend an"
B2,"Favourite places Bruce I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me not empty deserts. When I was eight I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. It felt very safe being in the middle of a village. I spent a week there riding my bike on its wide road and admiring all the different kinds of cows. One particular cow with its shiny belly fascinated me. I never forgot it. When I was eight years old I decided I wanted a little cow like it. My mother took me to the dairy at the farm to check the cows and when we found her, she bought her for me. I was very happy. The cow became part of my family. It's so beautiful and gentle and we loved her so much! Favourite place Bruce is the place that I am best able to describe. When I am in the country and I think of something, I go to the place in my mind and it's there forever. I was talking to a friend the other day and I told him that the place in my mind is the place which I always go to when I think of something. It was the same with my dog when I was little. When I was a child I would run with him everywhere in the countryside. The only thing which ever bothered me was the fact that when we went up a steep hill my dog would fall down and I had to pick him up. Then there is a funny memory from when I was seven. We were out running in the field and suddenly I tripped on a branch. It was difficult because the branches were wet but I managed to get him back up. I wasn't sure if"

A murder is announced and will take place on Friday October 29th at Little Paddocks at 6.30 p.m. We want Archie to find out who the murderer is, what sort of a apron the man wears and if it had a collar or buttons.' What is the answer?The murder is announced on a Friday, and it will take place at Little Paddocks on October 29th at 6:30 p.m. We want Archie to find out who the murderer is, what sort of a apron the murderer wears and if it has a collar or buttons.
The only evidence necessary is Archie’s note that he found on the murderer, and his notes.
Archie was able to narrow down the possible apron maker from a number of aunts and uncles. The aunts had been to Little Paddocks before. The uncle had not.
Archie was able to narrow down the aunts from two of them, so he had to find the uncle. 
Archie arrived at Little Paddocks on the Friday. He didn’t find out anything except the apron was called a ‘jumper,’ but the murderer wore a baseball cap with a logo on it. So he found his uncle. He found the uncle outside his house, but he said he wouldn’t be home for dinner. He said he would be back in a day. The uncle’s wife and daughter were also there.

B2,"Kowloon Walled City had no wall around it. Standing apart from the neighbouring buildings it rose to fourteen floors-buildings with more buildings piled on top. Legally it belonged to the People's Republic of China a part of the colony that was never British. In fact neither Chinese nor British law had effect there. The residents simply ignored both.
When people moved in they didn't live as if they were permanently living under the Chinese government. And when the People's Republic of China closed the port and airport leaving only the roads that had been built and left the building owners in complete control they also abandoned their laws and customs.
The people in Kowloon were able to negotiate with the locals on a daily basis. They came to an agreement that meant the owners of the houses that were higher than fifteen floors were willing to let the local people live there.
Kowloon had a population of roughly 1 million people. They worked on four different building types, the middle class owned three, the working class bought one and the lower class owned the other.
That last type of dwelling was a one bedroom apartment. Living on the top three floors they had a bedroom with a queen bed and a living room and kitchen with a kitchen sink and table. On the top floor they had a bathroom with a shower. Toilet paper and toilet paper rolls were not provided. A small kitchen sink would do and that was it. Everything was provided for them by the government. A landlord would pay the owner a monthly rent of four hundred and fifty dollars and one person was a tenant. They owned their own house and did not have to worry about paying rent or buying supplies and paying someone to fix their plumbing.
The Chinese gave the local people control of the area and money to live there. The Chinese owners of"
B2,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE When you first enter the Model Village it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground flat and completely overgrown with brambles. For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land.
We had recently received permission from the Mayor of York, Mr. Gordon Gill, to clear and transform this area for public open space so that we could develop it to a model community for our community.
During the months that followed we built a village centre building for meetings and to show other local groups how to take up building with young people.
We built the centre of the village with local suppliers; using their materials and the materials we had saved from previous buildings.
This was not only to make the project more local, but also to build some skills amongst our young people. We have built this model village with a lot of help from our local community. We thank everyone for all of their help.
There are still more work to be done but we are very excited to be working in this new project.
On the 2nd August we will have our first meeting. This is at 2pm in the village hall.
If anyone is keen on becoming involved there will be a recruitment drive.
There will be a brief introduction by the Village Stewards and a talk from the community development officer.
Please drop in if you would like more information on how you can get involved.
We thank everyone for their support.

Fun Island - The Burns family Last year we went to a huge theme park in the US and we thought that Fun Island might seem dull by comparison. But it was everything the Americans failed to be. This year it was the opposite - a fantastic day out. The Burns family have been to Disneyworld and Disneyland, but had never set foot in a theme park before. There was a lot of excitement in the camp before our trip - we knew that it would have a huge and spectacular water park where we could zip through the water and have the chance of doing a barrel roll. The water park is very big, with huge waterslides, so it's not a small and family friendly park. But it's not as big as most theme parks - even though it has a great deal of equipment for kids. As well as a huge water park there's an indoor theme park, a food court and an outdoor food court where you can have pizza delivered to the park. We had a fantastic day and we got to meet a very cute little boy called Charlie - his Dad said that he was always smiling and asking us to take him for rides. We were lucky to have got tickets to the end of the day for £4.95 a go. We booked tickets well in advance so it wasn't expensive - although my boys were still fidgeting all day. We had a £9.95 lunch and an entry to the park plus £2 per person per day parking which was cheaper than expected and we didn't have to queue - just a quick tap on the card. Charlie was very well behaved and enjoyed the rides. He spent the"

I've got to be doing something that's a challenge. If I'm absorbing something new and learning I get tremendous energy. If I'm bored or tired, I've got to do something else. If I'm not motivated at all, I've got to figure out why I'm not motivated.' There is no time for boredom to interfere with your work. You've got to make your work the top of your list at all times. I get motivated by something as simple as having a pen with me. Sometimes it's a pen because I'm running late or I'm having dinner with my friends and I want to be able to write something right away. Sometimes I have a pen because there is a new idea that's been staring at me for the past few hours and I want to write it right away. Then I have a pen to do that. 'I try to be a good listener to other people. If I've got questions or problems at work or things to talk about, I try to listen to other people and try to help them solve their problems if I can. I also try to make sure that I'm not too uptight about what I'm going to say in front of other people, because in the end, it's not about how I look or what I wear or what color my tie is.

Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it. A Jenny When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I was very small for a girl and I didn't wear make-up as much as other kids. My dad would take me to the makeup booth and it would just be me and the makeup artists. They would do some tests on me and they said I have quite a pretty face but I just seemed really shy. I'm so glad they gave me that opportunity to be able to do that. Jenny's Dad had taken her to the makeup booth before. He used to take her to get a little make-up when she was young but she said she never wanted to have to do that again. It was quite a big deal for her when they came to do her makeup for the first time. She had really, really big nerves. There were three other girls who had been there before but she had the highest anxiety. She didn't have her sister there because she would never be as nervous as her. She had her sister, Lizzie, there with her. Lizzie was in the same makeup booth but she was a little bit skinnier. Nina was in the makeup booth and her sister was waiting outside. She noticed that Lizzie was skinnier than Nina was. Nina was not used to seeing Lizzie with more weight and she was a bit nervous about looking fat next to her. Nina had an awful time that day. When the make-up woman was finished, she showed her the mirror and told her to look at herself and try to feel"

Julia Gregson asked three young stars and their mothers to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. A. Annika Reeder 15 won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. ""In my time I competed at the Olympics and I did it at the Commonwealth Games and at the World Championships,"" she says. ""It was a very different experience; it was a wonderful experience but it was very draining."" There's no doubt her success has made her a world star, but ""sometimes you'd feel quite lonely, as a youngster you're thinking 'Oh, but I'm not good enough,'"" says Rebecca Bellis, 24, who competed at the Olympics in London and won a gold medal in triathlon. ""You look around and you're like 'Am I really any good?' and you're thinking 'Oh my god, what am I doing wrong?'"" Rebecca now lives in Manchester, where she works in an engineering company and trains with a local club. She won a silver medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2012. Sarah Hillyer, 16, became a world champion this year when she triumphed in the under-17 women's 5,000m race. ""There were a lot of people around. And they're cheering, and then you're just thinking 'They can hear me, can't they? I'm running through this course - why can't they hear me?'"" She spends her free time doing charity events, but says training for triathlon has been a ""really hard year in terms of my mental health and mental strength, because I want to do something physically and then get into a good mental frame and have a good run.

B2,"The kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and riversfeeding on fish. Old trees overhang the stream half shading shallow water. Soft greens mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze. There is always a yellow heron perched by the stream side, but more often it is a heron or heron and some sort of duck that take their afternoon repose under the tall branches. It makes a soft humming noise as it takes it's refreshment before starting the long journey back home to its den. There is often a heron over the stream too. Charlie enjoys capturing this special wildlife of his. It really is the best part of his day. Charlie James's work has been featured in many magazines and newspapers, including Wildlife Photographer of the Year and on the cover of LIFE magazine. He has worked for the BBC as well as numerous magazines and newspapers. You can find more of his beautiful birds at the site www.charliajames.co.uk.

A kingfisher, not a bird of prey!
Kingfishers are birds of prey, and they are beautiful. I saw one last fall when I lived on a lake in Wisconsin. A real sight to see it flying around in a small lake.
There's no name for it either but the photo I see above looks to me like a kingfisher.
Thanks,
Rudy!
It's probably a kingfisher of some kind. Look at the head, neck and body position.

Like technical difficultiesstudio audiences are just another common feature of television lifeand yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows for example we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? And then they look at us and laugh at our obvious ignorance. For some it's simply part of the enjoyment of the programme itself. I for one can't stand being sat in a back row! I really do enjoy watching other people's reactions, as long as there are no technical difficulties! For Cosmo we were lucky to have a good studio audience for this episode of The National Lottery's Big Millions. They were quite enthusiastic when we started with our intro. Then the show opened with them cheering when a contestant won the Big One! They knew it was going to be some time before we could reveal the winners. The show opened and we announced that the four players had already decided to keep their tickets, but the players didn't have an announcement to make at the moment. We asked them to wait a bit while we made our announcement, but they seemed rather bored to be waiting. So I just told them that the announcement had to come first. Their reactions were hilarious, particularly the woman who was a bit nervous. I think the players were just relieved to have their money back and they all started to talk about their dreams. The one player had two! It's amazing how life can turn on a dime! At the end of the show when I showed them the winning numbers they were so happy I could see their faces. They also thanked me for the introduction. I have to admit I was very excited about this show and as soon as it started I couldn't control myself. I"
B2,"It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. Chris’ father Chris had a reputation as an adventurous sportsman with a quick temper. The family was from Croydon in south London. Like all great sportsmen they grew up watching football and they were not surprised when, aged just fourteen, Chris was signed by Arsenal. He was a talented footballer but he had a huge appetite for trouble too and quickly began to get embroiled in several incidents on and off the pitch. In September 1974, Chris and his Arsenal teammate John Grogan went AWOL from the training ground and never returned to the club. John got arrested for “causing a disturbance”. In the next few years Chris was involved in more minor skirmishes with fans, but was still generally accepted by the local community. However, when he was twenty-three he became embroiled in a nasty row with a local resident called Gary Collins. Chris had been drinking on a night out and accidentally knocked a man unconscious with a punch he believed to be a harmless bouncy ball. Gary was upset about the attack and began a campaign of harassment and vandalism. When Chris tried to stop the vandalism, the man became more aggressive. Things went on for several months but, in October 1977, Chris finally had enough. He returned to his home in London and decided to take action against Gary. After several weeks, he borrowed a hammer and took on his enemy. He knocked out Gary to the extent that he needed five stitches in his eyebrow to close the wounds. Gary went to prison."
B2,"In April 1919 the British rulers in India decided to put down protests in the city of Amritsar. As people gathered in the public garden during the festival of Vaisakhi a British general ordered his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd. As well as thousands of injuries there were hundreds of deaths. The massacre in Amritsar has become known as the Golden Jubilee massacre. In the following years the British authorities tried to cover up the incident and the official death toll was not released until 1952. The number of people that actually died in this incident, including women and children, was not included in the official tally of deaths and injuries.

It was widely believed by British authorities that the actual death toll was over 1500. After the official death toll was released in 1952 British authorities released the official death toll of 500. This was a high number of deaths but was not as high as the death toll previously believed and there was the possibility that there were people that had died but were never recorded as such. It is now believed that British authorities in India deliberately covered up the mass killings in Amritsar during the Golden Jubilee massacre in order to prevent public unrest and unrest in the country.

This incident has had a significant impact on Indian history and public opinion in the coming years. The killings of people in Amritsar resulted in riots in the state of Punjab and further unrest. British officials had also hoped that people would remain in their homes during the Golden Jubilee celebrations. This is clearly not the case as many people took to the streets to protest against the British rule, with some riots taking place in the state of Punjab. In the coming years it is likely that the Golden Jubilee massacre will have a significant impact on political and social relations in the British Indian Empire"
B2,"GM's clever EN-V concept is a two-wheeled two-seater solution to urban transport. Telegraph Motoring's Mike Rutherford has a preview and takes it for a spin. That's because of the nature of the EN-V. Last week I drove one of these though it was more like flying a small plane than driving. The car was so light that it almost felt weightless.
The EN-V will go well with some sports cars. It's very lightweight and the styling is very similar to the Bentley Continental GT Sport.
There are four wheels, not four wheels and two tires, and so there's less than 50 pounds (22.6 kilos) per wheel for acceleration and cruising.
The interior has a very similar look to a Bentley Continental GT, with a carbon fiber bucket seats and dashboard. They're also very similar to the seats on the Lamborghini Countach, though I found the seats in my Lambo to be more comfortable.
The only real difference is in the front seats. There are bucket seats for a driver, an emergency front seat passenger, and a seat in front for the driver with a USB port.
There's also a large central storage pocket for your phones and tablets.
The EN-V uses a fuel cell power plant in its battery. There are two fuel cells in the vehicle and these power both of the front wheels. The fuel cells are connected to a battery pack.
You'll probably find a more detailed review and a video of the vehicle in the gallery.

A Andrea Thompson - Newsreader I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to get back there as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. You can really feel the sun on your face and the sea rolling into your arms as you ride. The train is slow, but its history and scenery makes up for that in my eyes. The conductor is so excited that he announces we're a bit past St Tropez on our way to Bordeaux, and we can smell all the perfume of the shops along the coast. The journey along the coast is so beautiful, and you can really feel the breeze on your face as the train moves along the sea. The conductor announces we're now in the town of St Nazaire, and that's when I find out about the great wine tasting that happens here. It's a real treat, with French winemakers going around tasting each other's wine. It's a great way to enjoy the scenery and the wine of France. Andrew Morgan, ITV News, 2005.

B2,"What would happen to our planet if humans were to suddenly disappear? This is the basic hypothesis behind Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us. Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear. In one chapter there is an analysis of how New York would survive if there were no humans to take care of it. It would still be the financial center of the United States, but the streets would be empty.
In chapter 4 Weisman focuses on the ecological repercussions of our actions, and he looks at how far society has come in terms of its ability to affect the natural world. This book offers an interesting perspective on what it would be like to live without humans, and the implications of our lack of impact on the planet.
The book isn't exactly easy to get into, although it is an interesting read. The author writes in the ""introduction"" that he was thinking a lot about what he had just read, when in fact he had just read it and felt it was important to express.
The most interesting aspect of the book is the discussion of how the population control movement has affected societies. The World Without Us is an interesting read, but I would suggest avoiding the first few chapters if at all possible.
In an interesting chapter Weisman looks at two countries which attempt to control their population, the tiny, and seemingly closed community of Tzahal and the larger, much larger Germany. In Tzahal the inhabitants choose a simple life and avoid the modern world. They also do not have children, and many women in this community do not breastfeed. In Germany, Germany offers more freedom in the form of more education, more freedoms in the form of more choice, more choice in the form of more access to healthcare and more access to food. In both instances, a"
B2,"Living in the valley We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival. It was the year when the storms came early before the calendar even hinted at winter even before November was out. We have always been accustomed to living in the valley, where water is scarce, but this was the most dangerous season for us. That was the season when heavy rains washed away our fields; that was the season when the rivers overflowed. This season we lost two thousand trees that had stood on the hillsides for three thousand years and when they fell, the hills could not hold their weight. It was the season when the rivers could not be crossed without boats, even when it was a season when a heavy wave could be felt and the waters of the river could be seen to foam. We had watched as our fields turned to mud; we could see the roots and branches of the trees in our backyard. We looked at our barren fields and saw only mud. We could not see the river. The water had dried up the river, which was the only way we knew of to cross the river and get across the valley. When our house got swept away, we knew that we had to cross the river to escape. We walked across the mud fields which was all we had left when we fled the valley. We walked and walked in that miserable night and in the morning we had walked all the way to Kedarnath. We started the long trek in the dark and we all woke up at seven in the morning. We had made it. We had crossed over and survived. It was a sad day. But today my father tells me that he is very sorry for not telling us about"

""Can't you afford a ballroom?"" he said, ""Why don't you go back to the country and I'll buy you a nice ballroom. If you're ever in Paris, I'll show you the most elegant room in all Paris."" So Seymour went back to his flat and had a long conversation with his wife. He took out a photograph from his wallet and showed it to her. Then he said to her, ""This is what I've been planning. And there's another girl as well - Marie. If you have a good time, if you know any of these girls, they'd like to dance with you - and I might even arrange to see them again. My wife says I'm going too far - but she doesn't mind. I want to see her again - if I'm lucky."" Seymour was delighted with himself and was planning to write a letter to Marie that night. However, before he could finish the letter to Marie, he was disturbed by an angry voice. The telephone rang and Seymour answered it, but the caller didn't say any names. ""You're ruining everything,"" he shouted, ""and I hate you!"" Seymour turned and ran to the cellar. There he found that the caller was in fact Marie. ""I've come to tell you that I've decided to go home,"" she said. ""You can come, too,"" Seymour"
B2,"Style Merchants Style informs every part of our lives today from clothes to interior decoration and accessories. Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion. Ned Ingham: Dress Designer Ned Ingham makes dreamy romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles' he explains. 'And the wedding cake needs something a little more sophisticated for today's generation.' With the exception of the usual tulle and veil, many of Ned Ingham's dresses are made from white lace, or silk tulle and a matching veil. Ned Ingham believes white and lace, white and silk and lace are all the rage in fashion this year. This, he says, is a good look for weddings. Ned Ingham feels 'white is the fashion for the day. It's a clean white with a subtle pattern of cream and cream. The bride will look elegant in it, it's light and breathable and the style will be timeless.' Other dresses in the new catalogue feature tulle, lace or beading. 'A dress can be as pretty and elegant as silk or lace if the right accessories are used.' The dress of choice for Ned Ingham's guests is always a white or cream number with a long skirt, and of course a bit of flair added with a tiara and other jewels. This means more white and beading. 'But don't forget the big white tiaras.' For the bride-to-be, the style of dress Ned Ingham suggests this year for her is a'smooth, classic silhouette with a slightly open skirt and a low back and a high neckline. These styles are not just for the bride-to-be, but will always be a classic look for most people at any time of the"

B2,"A NEW LIFE The Farmer Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm. 'After 14 years in business I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. I didn't want that to happen to my farm,' he explains. 'But now people come to the farm for a rural lifestyle. They want something to be proud of, to look forward to. I want people to have an experience which they will remember for years to come.' He's also got a keen eye for design and the sheep and lambs will soon be seen in his new shop: 'The sheep will be in the front, the shop in the side. It's a big old building but we've gone away from the old way of doing things. With the sheep we've gone in and made it simple. We're using modern designs and things like that. 'There will be a good mix of domestic and commercial.' Froggatt's farm is a working example of what can happen when a farmer takes a job outside his trade - a lifestyle that might only last for a few months, but one which ends up long lasting. We went on a sheep trip with him and his son and his wife, who runs the kitchen. But before we went up on the farm we stopped off to pick up the farmer at a place he'd suggested - a coffee shop called Cafe Rouge. I'd heard about it, so thought we'd give it a go, the farmer told me. So I drove down there with the boy and we met Matt, his wife Jenny and their two sons Luke and Alex, aged 10 and seven.

C1,"We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
We swapped lives with five people. This way everyone got to live a different kind of day. We changed the person's life and also their own. We made a day out of their worst nightmare. They can now say: ""I have never been homeless."" We even had an opportunity to give them a new identity as well. It was a unique chance for them to show their personality and their talents.
We swapped lives with a family. They have always been worried about money and, as a result, they have always been afraid. In one day, the family can say: ""We have always been poor but we are now rich."" We got to know them better and we were able to offer our support. We were able to give them our money and we were able to change their life for the better.
Now it's time to get back to normal. But we didn't really leave the world behind. We left it with the memories. The money and a new identity have gone but we left with our hearts.
It was a fantastic and fun experience for all of us. But the most important thing was that we got to know the family better and understand them more. We were able to help them change for the better and to make them feel happier and more successful.
All in all, it was an unforgettable and memorable day. We learned a lot from each other and we gained new friends for life. It is important to understand your families' emotions. They all"
C1,"Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country says Georgina Ferry but she is little known For the past four years I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. If they are asked what Dorothy is they say'she is the female scientist who won the Nobel prize for medicine for discovering the gene for Hodgkin's disease'. If they insist that I give them the full name they insist that I spell it 'Dorothy Hodgkin'. 'Dorothy Hodgkin?' they say. 'I can't help it, the name sounds too foreign. I prefer to think of her as Mrs. Hodgkin.' The result is a stream of blank expressions and, occasionally, tears. No matter how many times I repeat the name I know I will be met with blank stares and the same unhelpful shrug as before. If it has already come up in conversation I am usually met with silence and a puzzled expression. If they say that my pronunciation is off, I point out that there are only two 'k's' in 'Dorothy' and explain that I speak with a London accent. Even if they don't know why I pronounce it 'Dorothy', they are invariably puzzled to learn that this is what I am talking about. A few days later, when we were talking about a case of Hodgkin's disease which was giving so much trouble that a new treatment was needed, they began to tell me what happened to Dorothy. 'She invented a vaccine.' I explained this to them but they had no idea what I was on about. What about the name 'Dorothy Hodgkin' is confusing them?You've given them"

Janson started tromping in the 80's using her art as a means of escape. To give her a distraction, she painted a series of strange images to take away the mind set and to be enthralled for a short time. She has used all kinds of different materials from paper to oil to rubber to paint the images. Many of her paintings are now available at her website http://www.sarahjansons.com/ Sarah does have a signature which is printed in the corner to ensure the piece is real. This is the only way she knows that the piece is for sale. Sarah is very selective with what paintings she sells. Her paintings sell very well but she only makes one or two of a series. Her paintings are limited in the sense that she only makes a very small number of each. Janson's work has been shown at the following shows: New York, London, Toronto, and Washington D.C.

C1,"A trumpet isn’t just for Christmas… It is strange how many musicians even leading ones come from homes without music. Out of the blue Hakan Hardenberger the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world’s trumpet-players today. He first appeared on the music scene with his first quartet during the first years of his life. Now, at the age of 38, with five albums and a wide variety of recordings and concerts under his belt and a regular contract with a label in Stockholm, he continues his adventure in this musical journey that started way back when he was just nine years old. It is indeed amazing to see such a beautiful instrument as the trumpet being used in such a versatile way. It is amazing how far he has come!
The very first quartet he ever joined was a small group of children and teenagers that played in the same school in Upplands Listan. During his years of training and preparation he was a soloist in many school and college bands and the young musician started his musical journey back in the second year of high-school. It was in this second year when he first played at the music school in Uppsala with the Uppsala National Symphony Orchestra. After a few years at university he started the Royal Stockholm Conservatoire in which he has been living for almost 15 years. In 2004 he won an international competition in the trumpet and in 2005 the prize for a classical ensemble with the same school as him, where he was a soloist. The following year he also won the best trumpet soloist in the competition in Stockholm. He continued this tradition and won the prizes for best trumpet soloist in 2009 and in 2012 and 2013.

I like the setting of the pub, the ambience is pleasant and the food was very good. The pub is open from 10am to 4pm. I had the fish and chips with a pint of dark beer and a slice of lemon drizzle cake. The owner’s daughter did a lovely little job in the pub and I was very happy with the service that I received. I would definitely come back. THE BANDIT HALL I enjoyed The Bandit Hall thoroughly. I really felt at home here. The owner welcomed me in and I enjoyed my time there with a warm welcome. The food was superb, the atmosphere is very friendly. The Bandit Hall serves a varied menu of hot and cold food and the venue is very warm. I would definitely recommend this pub for people to enjoy a day out and relax. LANDHORSE COTTAGES COTTAGES ARE CAMPING IN DALEY, CUMBERLAND. THEY ARE OPEN FROM 10am TO 4pm FROM SUNDAY TO FRIDAY AND 10am TO 5pm ON Saturdays.

C1,"He had said exactly the name Emma wanted him to say. Now she could suggest that it was difficult to explain matters by letter and she offered to go over to Rouen and speak to him directly. Charles would not hear of troubling her. She insisted. It was a battle of kindness. 

The next day, the day they had agreed to meet, Emma wrote to explain her decision to go to Rouen. She had been quite ill all night. Her stomach was upset. As a doctor, Dr. Gaudron believed it prudent to see the surgeon. Emma was grateful for the time together, but she was also concerned for Charles’s condition, and that of their son. Charles explained the situation briefly, while Emma tried to compose herself and compose her letter. 

I will go to Rouen tomorrow. It is not far from where we met this evening. Perhaps I will see you there. I am very sorry that I will not be able to say good-bye in person, but it is just impossible. I can write for hours, but I will not be able to stop saying how much I love you until I do. I do not know how to explain this.
You must have no fear. I am with God, and I have promised him to return.

With love,

Your sweetheart,

Emma, 16, February, 1840 

On Friday, she wrote, she had been able to compose a more personal letter. She was tired, but her courage was growing. Her heart was breaking, but it was stronger. 

To my dear Charles: You must never give up. I cannot bear the thought of losing you. You are my soul, I love you. I"
C1,"Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work. A. What makes a good leader? A leader is one who inspires an agent of change a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better as the early theorists believed. They were wrong as the leaders of the world today prove - their short stature did not hinder them as they led from the front. Leadership is about vision, passion and commitment - and the right mindset. Your ability to deliver value through vision and passion will make you stand out as a leader. You need vision and passion to drive your organisation. Your passion for the organisation drives you towards development and innovation which helps the organisation achieve more. And as you become more passionate about the organisation, you become more innovative and determined to lead it. You then become an agent of change. To become an agent of change you need not only the motivation but you also need the ability to lead. You need the motivation to lead your team, and you also need the ability to lead. Motivation is the ability to turn challenges into opportunities for your team. There are three main sources of motivation: personal goals, company goals and group goals. In many organisations, all or a portion of their goals are personal, group or company goals. A motivated person will strive for success and happiness in his personal life and career. There are three ways to motivate yourself: setting goals, planning goals and achieving goals. 1. Setting goals can be easier said than done. The reason for this is that goals often require a lot of planning and analysis which requires a lot of effort. Setting goals can seem boring at first, but with the right motivation it can be a fun way to achieve your goals. 2. Planning goals will take a"
C1,"Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession A The rules for work are changing We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are or by our training and expertise but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a term that has been thrown around a lot in business, but what is EI? It is a mental ability measured by those who practice it - you. It is being able to handle uncertainty and ambiguity effectively and to maintain positive emotional states while remaining focused on the task at hand. A person's emotional state has an impact on their performance, particularly on their motivation to do work, as described in Daniel Goleman's new book. It is a simple premise but one that is difficult to convey to the non-business person. The book begins with a list of definitions, but the best way to read this book is to think of it as a roadmap for managing emotions at work. It is divided into five chapters. The first two are based on Goleman's own experience at the New York Times, including an interview with Jim Collins on Emotional Intelligence. Chapter three focuses on ""How to Manage Emotions at Work,"" and the fourth chapter looks at ""The Way We Think About Work and What That Means for Management."" The final chapter considers the ""people skills"" that make a person successful at work. For me, the key part of the book is the last two chapters. They offer strategies for working with your coworkers, leaders and clients and also present a series of exercises for developing your own emotional intelligence. The first of these is called ""The Four Practices of Emotional Intelligence,"" and you will find a number of exercises in the first"

C1,"Sound the Alarm Stuart Harris reports Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? You don't. So the industry says. A new study has just confirmed their fears by suggesting that our preferred modes of communication are no more effective at raising awareness and behaviour change than are the more familiar methods. The researchers say it is better to choose a non-traditional method. One that will engage the listener and make them feel that they are part of the programme. Such an approach would be best suited to providing the right information at the right time on the radio rather than being a substitute for an alert message on television. The findings were published in the British Journal of Public Health. The researchers used a simple test to measure our preference for certain types of content. They used a telephone survey of 545 people in which they asked respondents to press a button to answer. A computer then tracked how quickly they pressed the button. The more they pressed it the faster they responded. The results were consistent across the age group and the type of questions asked. We liked listening to announcements at 4am when we were reading a story. But we were also willing to listen to programmes that were designed to encourage us to make a change. The results are interesting for all sorts of purposes. First, the findings are consistent with the idea that ""promising messages"" are not better than those that are ""banned"". That is, a ""good"" message could be banned by the media and if that is so then the media should produce alternative messages that are more appealing. That's because the ""bad"" messages"
C1,"With the trees I planted my stake in New Zealand JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER Jonallum Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology'. I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn’t have any summers. I spent one year on a farm in rural New Zealand where there was no snow on the trees, and I took an apprenticeship on a farm in Wales where we had a lot of snow in the trees, and then I returned to New Zealand. In between I had nothing to do. It was wonderful to sit in the living room and read, write letters and go to church and not do anything. It took about four years to finish my degree. I had a lot of fun then, doing nothing. My favourite book at the moment is A Tree For My Dad by Jonathan Yardley. It is a book about the trees and how they have inspired nature in our lives. It gives you the chance to look at the trees and see how much they mean to us and how much we love them. It has really inspired me to start planting trees here in London again. We need to keep creating more forests in London so they continue to be part of our landscape. It is so important. You can think about it all the time and people don’t realise how many trees are gone in London. You just don’t realise. One tree can produce two tonnes of carbon dioxide. When you can think about that it really makes you feel the effect that we have on the trees. I always used to think how lucky we are to have a small amount of space to work with. We are so lucky. We don’t have to go through a million trees to get to"

C1,"Hide and Seek Yvonne Coppard Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game — surveillance of a suspicious bookshop — when she realises that one of its rare customers is her Uncle Jim. He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard. A clever blend of thriller, mystery, social drama and black comedy with a lightening of tone which sets a tone for the rest of the film. The film is funny and amusing and the soundtrack with its songs (written by Coppard) is charming and musical. The film ends with a lovely song sung by the film's stars that expresses how much the film makes us feel like we know its characters. - IMDb

James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase as a headmistress of a girls' school. One of these, a trilogy, has been nominated for the Booker Prize, in recognition of the talent of the author. She lives in Berkshire with her husband, a solicitor who works out of London. Michaels begins her conversation with a memory: ""The year before I was married, I was living in rural Surrey. I lived with my aunt and uncle, who had given me a cottage. I was in love with the local farmer's son. There was a great deal to talk about, and, like all teenagers, we talked about everything under the sun."" I confess, like any teenager myself, I could talk, very loudly, about absolutely anything under the sun. What was her name, again?

C1,"Great sports Women on a winning streak To excel in any sport is hard enough even far men but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records.
What makes these women successful? We know one main factor is that they never stop trying. A female athlete needs to be dedicated, work hard and never give up.
5. Practice makes perfect.: It's not just in sports that women are able to succeed. The fact that they practice makes it easier for them. It can be very hard to get up early and work hard in an unfamiliar city, but they just have to start somewhere. If you have the right mentality and drive, you won't have any problems.
6. Keep your head high.: When things don't go as well as you wanted, you have to think to yourself that it was only a game. Remember that you were never beaten. When you start feeling down, just look at the next practice and find a way to win.
7. Find out the strengths and weaknesses.: For example, you know that you are fast, but you don't want to just go to a running track and just run. You have to work on your sprinting and your endurance, because the faster you run the more likely you are to be injured.
8. Choose a sport that suits your body.: In terms of athletics, they say that a good athlete has good cardio and good flexibility. Choose a sport that works for you, since you won't be able to do it all.
9. Build an appropriate base.: If you are new to a sport, take some time to learn how to do the different"

C1,"BRINGING UP BADGERS ‘What now?’ was my immediate thought as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‘open farm’ six years ago we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. In the last 18 months alone we’ve found homes for a cat, bunny and turtle all after being rescued from the local abattoir. Now we’re on the lookout for a baby donkey and we could use your help.
I was about to make another run to the canteen to get some water when I remembered the box I’d brought back home from the supermarket the day before. Derek spotted it out of sight in a corner and said he’d get it for me. Now I knew why I hadn’t heard any noises.
He had indeed. As soon as he saw the box he had one of those bemused shrugs. ""I thought you might have been up to something,"" he said.
As soon as Derek had the donkey in his arms it had been easy to fall in love with him. He was just as plump as my favourite doll and as easy to handle as a cuddly toy.
I sat on his back and held his tiny front legs in front of me. It felt like a dream. The donkey looked back at me and I was lost for words.
The old farmhouse where we live is a three hour drive from the nearest market town, and we knew from experience that we’d never be able to take care of this one alone. Our neighbours know we run the donkey clinic and would be delighted to help. The farmer next door has a family of eight small children"
C1,"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. The reviews in the newspapers do not tell us whether a book is worthwhile or not - what the reviews say about whether the book will be a good success is what does the books sales. The second part of the newspaper is where the advertising is. Where do the sales come from? There are many reasons behind why a book is successful. It may have been a bestseller, but may not have been a big seller. It may have been popular, but may not have been a bestseller. It may have received a very good review, but not many, a bad one or even a mixed review. And it may have been a very popular book, but not popular enough to make money. However the reason that a book becomes a big success or a success is that the reviews, which have always had an effect, in some cases significantly affect the sales. Some publishers will take this into account when they choose the titles of the books that they publish. However, in other cases, they will ignore what the reviews say. This is because they will say ""That sounds like a very good idea. I will publish it"". The fact is, however, that, in either case, the book sales will be very high, but, it will not matter which version is chosen as long as the reviews are positive. And, if reviews are not positive, it won't matter which version is chosen. But, it is not just publishers. Books are bought by readers, people who have already decided that"

C1,"But he most regretted his denials that the industry aimed its advertising at teenagers. ""We spent millions studying kids. We knew that they could name the three most advertised brands of cigarettes. We knew that almost 90 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands. ""When I heard what the tobacco companies said, I said to myself, This is bullshit. When they were lying to Congress, they weren't lying just to us. The truth has been out there for months and months."" Advertisement The tobacco industry has made more than $70 billion by convincing parents and school teachers that they are not involved in their children's addiction to cigarettes. And their advertisements have convinced young adults that their smoking is not unhealthy. According to a Harvard Medical School report on teen smoking in the United States, the television programs and newspapers in which tobacco firms have sponsored their product are the most influential factors in teenagers' ability to smoke. The average American teenager can only choose from about a dozen major cigarette companies, each advertising various products and making a range of claims concerning their safety, including claims that smoking reduces health risks. Advertisement The advertising campaign in the United States is estimated to have been the strongest in the world, in terms of dollar value. The top 20 television networks and 25 newspapers devoted almost as many minutes to advertising tobacco companies as to all the other news about the world, such as the death toll from famine, war, terrorism, and other ills of the world.

C1,"THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should combine old and new says Tom Cunliffe. And he put it into practice in his own craft 'The Westerman'. This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. Tom Cunliffe was in the dock this year. This elegant motor boat, called The Westerman, is an ideal example. It combines a clean, elegant hull shape, with a powerful, fuel-efficient motor. Tom Cunliffe's design won best motor yacht in the 2006 World Boat Show and this year. The boat's owners have built a very successful marina at the edge of the Dartmoor national park. In a few months, the Westerman, a hybrid motor/sail boat, will arrive on the Devon coast. In the meantime, it is being fitted at a small boat yard in Oxford. But, in many respects, the Westerman is a normal motor yacht, a'super yacht' if you like. It is 36 feet long with a beam of 9 feet 6 inches. It can carry 24 guests, or 16 crew in the very spacious accommodation. A good amount of space is taken up by a huge saloon, that is the largest saloon on a motor yacht that I have ever seen. There is a dining area off the saloon. And there are six further bedrooms. But, of more interest to the readers of this magazine, there is a huge open-air salon with a huge glass panelled room off it. The saloon's design has the advantage of using a lot of glass. The sun can pour in during the day. And it doesn't have to worry about wind-swept decks. It is easy"
C1,"Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards. The hedgehogs can be found in their natural habitat around the world. All hedgehogs are carnivores but their diet varies depending on the environment in which they live. Hedgeshogs are members of the rodent order Chiropodia. They are very similar in appearance to rats. They share the ability to roll into a tight ball, making them defenceless against predators. Hedgeshogs are generally harmless to people unless attacked by large animals like otters, which kill hedgehogs often. A hedgehog will typically live for between 4 - 8 years, depending on the area they live in. When they are large they can live for 15 - 20 years. There is no clear cut definition of what constitutes a hedgehog. A male hedgehog may look similar to a female and a female may look similar to a male. However, there is only one male and only one female from each population. The hedgehog only needs to live in the wild to be able to reproduce so they are usually raised by an animal of their own species. All hedgehogs are solitary animals, but when they do interact they usually remain on their own. When they become old enough they start to live with groups of other hedgehogs. There are four major types of hedgehog. The first type has a flat body, but their spine are pointed. The second type has spines at the front and back of its body, with a flattened head. The third type have long spines attached"
C1,"Blacksmiths THROUGHOUT the ages iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers because they were the sole providers of weapons armour and farming tools. They were also thought to possess mystical power.

The work of a blacksmith is divided into three phases. The first phase is the forging of metal into weapons and armour. The second involves the repair of iron or metal that has already been forged or is damaged. The final phase is the smelting of metals to produce steel.

In medieval times blacksmiths also repaired farm equipment such as ploughs. Medieval blacksmiths also found work as judges and as police officers during times of plague. The medieval blacksmith was also thought to have had the ability to create ghosts.

When the Industrial Revolution broke out a blacksmith was the only one who could provide these essential products. With the coming of the 20th Century a whole new industry was born but the blacksmith tradition still lives on and has created a wide range of products in shops around the world.

A blacksmith uses two sticks and a hammer to smash apart steel bars in a forge. Each bar is made out of different metals such as iron and copper and some are harder than others. The hardest ones are used for weapons and armour. The best swords are made out of iron and if they are not, steel is a good substitute. An iron sword will be more expensive than a steel sword so it takes longer to make. Iron is hard to forge and the heat can cause it to warp.

 The Tartan Museum The modern cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened. You cannot miss it. 
  
  
  
 At last year’s Scottish Open, when the wind blew the scores high, it wasn’t the conditions that stood out - it was the tartan clothing of the spectators, of course, many of whom had been welcomed to the venue in the traditional way. But the Scottish Open will soon be coming back to Carnoustie, and to the new tartan museum. 
  
  
  
 There are more than 100,000 items to look at in the museum, and they cover almost every aspect of Scottish sport. They cover team sports, rugby and football. They cover golf, hunting, shooting, kilt-making, polo, ice hockey, badminton, tennis, rugby, swimming, weight-lifting and rugby union. 
  
  
  
 One of the first to visit the museum was Brian Clark, a Scottish swimmer who, at the age of 50, is the oldest person to have ever qualified for the World Swimming Championships, in Glasgow in 2011. “I was the first person to have my"
C1,"In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr Toby Clark a researcher at the British Geological Survey aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. He also drew up his famous Chart of Celestial Latitudes, whose data was used as the basis for the British government's navigational system. Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is setting off on a quest to retrace Halley's quest to chart compass variations. He's been researching the comet since 2009 and is currently exploring the southern sky. He's been exploring the southern sky and discovering a new constellation, Sirius. He's also noticed that Halley's comet is much dimmer today than in the early 19th century. He says it has a lot to do with the solar system's recent evolution. Advertisement
Sir Edmund Halley was born in 1656. He was an astronomer, physician, and mathematician. His comet is known as Halley's and it is visible today.
He was a member of the Royal Society. He co-discovered a comet with William Shakespeare, Comet Ptolemy.
Sir Edmund was the chief navigator of the King's Ships.
Sir Edmund was responsible for charting the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth.
Sir Edmund was the father of Edward, 2nd Baronet (1691-1751) and Lady Eleanor (née Halley).
He also fathered a daughter who was named in his honor. This daughter was an accomplished lady and became a lady in waiting.
He died on 20 December 1742. He was buried at his beloved cottage, known as the Royal"

C1,"Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott shares with his readers the mystical experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent: the Seven Summits. My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I will take them in the order of my climbing them. A. Mt. Everest: I arrived at the North Pole and made my way around South America. In Peru I made my way to the Inca Trail for my first summit. I took my next trip to the Himalayas with a company called Mountaineering Adventures. We climbed many of the highest peaks in the Himalayas. One of my favorite destinations we visited was the Nanda Devi Range. The summit of Nanda Devi was our highest point. A. Mt. Kanchenjunga: This mountain was my first summit. In Tibet it was the first mountain I ever tried to climb. I climbed it as part of my Mount Everest Project. As you can see from the image, it was the most difficult climb. We had to climb to the highest point we could find, then descend to the North Side of the mountain to the South Side. This was very tiring work. There were many times I would just collapse and sleep for an hour on the way down. However, I made it. I continued to climb with Mountaineering Adventures, which brought me to A. Mt. Annapurna. Here is a great photo I took of the mountaineers arriving at this mountain. I was able to spend time with the mountaineers, climb the mountain and have fun! A. Mt. Kullu: This mountain was our highest at 8,079 feet. Our summit was beautiful. It is a very difficult climb and a very beautiful summit. Here"
C1,"Photographing People People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations the photographer has to be conscious of actions gestures and expressions. The aim of photography is to document our world. So it becomes the aim of a photographer to be aware and pay attention to the details and movements of subjects. In other words, to photograph people so as to capture an image worthy of publication.
  
 We have already been discussing the basics. What do we usually use to photograph people? A camera with a lens. In the past the most popular camera was the medium format SLR (Single Length Roll-Cam). However, due to technological advances and changes in film and lens manufacturing the modern SLR is no longer the most popular camera for photographers. Instead of the SLR we are witnessing the birth of digital cameras. They have more advantages than their previous digital counterparts but it’s the price that is probably the most important consideration for most photographers.
  
 Some people still use the SLR cameras, not because they want to but because of the convenience they offer. They are the ideal camera for serious photographers, those who do not want to leave their studio for a long time.
  
 Another important consideration for photographers is the quality of the photographs. If the subject is not a good fit for the camera then it will produce a blurry result. Also, even a blurry picture can still be interesting. But again, the key is whether the subject fits the camera or not.
  
 We have already discussed the basics. Now we want to start thinking about the technical aspects. I remember in the"
C1,"The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her in action. One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. The hotel has had an unhappy past in the past, and it is now in serious need of a new lease of life, especially with the recent success of The Great Tourist Trade. But the new ownership, the brothers Gogarty, plan to make their business fortunes by ripping apart the very building their family has been in since its first days, a building that stands at the center of all the hotel’s activity. An old building with a new face. All too soon, the hotel is being torn down, and the brothers, with only a skeleton crew to carry out the demolition, attempt to have all of the windows removed and then move in. In a bid to save the building and restore it to the glory it once held, the brothers Gogarty create a fake guest room that is exactly the same as the rooms they would be ripping out. Hotel Inspector Sue Brown finds out exactly how far the Gogarty brothers will go to get their hotel back into the black, and how much they are willing to risk to do it. It all comes down to one decision: Is it right to rip out the people who have spent their life here, or is it right to restore the old hotel? Can they make a better home for their old hotel than the Gogarty brothers ever could? Or will they all get to go back home?

C1,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support If you applied for a job in some countries you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting as much as anything else that would determine your suitability for the job. That’s because most people think of handwriting as a way of revealing a person’s values. Now it seems that some researchers are suggesting that there is another kind of quality they could be measuring in handwriting: the writer’s character. This could suggest that a person’s behaviour can be judged by the way they write. The research, carried out by Martin Groskirch of the University of Basel, Switzerland, and his colleagues, suggests that handwriting contains clues about personality that can be measured. It turns out that if you compare people who are of the same personality but with different handwriting styles you can get a measure of the personality of one based on the other. Those who were of the same personality and the same style had identical handwriting, but those who were of different personalities and different styles had different handwriting. And those who had the same handwriting and were of the same personality were identical to those who had different handwriting and were of a different personality. Some of the clues they uncovered are pretty obvious. People who have a dominant dominant writing style are usually more organised than those who don’t. But you can still look deeper into how people write and determine a person’s personality. For example, people who write in a blocky cursive script have an extra personality that is not always obvious. Some have a tendency to be aggressive and some to be more considerate, for example. And if someone has a particular way of writing which makes it"
C1,"Volunteer tourism Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. A. It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly.
In the same way, some voluntary workers can do more harm than good, by overworking themselves, overshooting their intended target in terms of time, and overachieving in terms of results.
The question is: should voluntary workers be paid?
Voluntary tourism is important. So what? What we do is important. So are the decisions we make. What matters most is how we work and our decision-making processes. These should be guided by the needs of the project and the community that we are working with.
These days, we have many examples of the positive impact of volunteer work. We should not forget that volunteers are, by nature, altruistic. There are many good works of the volunteers in this field. But there are also also examples of waste. In addition to the waste caused by the volunteers, we also have the risks related to diseases and terrorism.
We should also not forget that in international tourism, an increasing number of tourists comes to India from the Middle East and North Africa. The increase is mainly due to increased political tension and conflict, such as the war in Syria and the ongoing tensions in Yemen. These are two major factors that make it hard for the tourists to visit a country that is not free from conflict.
This also affects the businesses that are associated with tourism, such as hotels and restaurants. This is not only because of the tourism itself, but also because, as the tourists are going to visit certain places of interest that they"
C1,"A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Every cast is a “perfect match” to any other that is known to exist. The most obvious way to tell the difference between sculptures is with the use of a microscope. In a typical museum exhibition the work is arranged chronologically so that what was the “last used” is the farthest from the front. It is always easier to identify “the wrong one” when works are spread like that, but this is not always a practical way of looking at an exhibition. You might well say that most museums are like that (that this is how most exhibitions are), but in the case of the University Museum of Classical Archaeology the work is arranged in such a way that “the most recent one” is very close to the back. Also, the “most recent” is often an older cast than any of the others. The display can also be quite confusing, since there are so many different models and sizes of sculptures and models and models that are hard to compare to one another, and so much of the cast selection is made on the basis of what is “the most recent” (and least expensive). There are some exceptions to all of this, and there are other museums that display the whole range of Greek and Roman sculpture in a more realistic way, but for the general viewer this is the best way to understand the exhibition. When the exhibition opens, all the casts are being exhibited together, but with a careful balance on the"
C1,"Are you too nice for your own good? When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity. 'I'm so sorry' I beamed when I dropped the plate on the floor and it smashed into smithereens. It is a habit I have kept ever since. I make a point of smiling at all customers every day, whether they are happy or not. It is often my duty to smile at strangers at the airport and on trains. There is nothing more annoying than being seated next to someone who looks annoyed to be there. So I smile, wave back and say a quick 'hello' every time. It may not seem polite or considerate of me to force my way into people's lives. But sometimes I do have a conscience. For instance I was sitting in a cinema last night and the person next to me was not smiling. I thought he looked bored. I smiled at him and said 'Hello'. I felt that I owed it to him to smile too. You might think I'm an insincere grin-wearer. But I try not to let my smiling be superficial. I look everyone in the eye when I am smiling. And I am not afraid to say 'hello' if someone else's eyes are downcast. I do not see any reason to lie, not when I smile all day. So I do not let myself believe that my smiles do not mean anything. Maybe they don't. And maybe my kindness and good cheer really are just part of my personality. And if it is so, then I want to spread it. That is my dream. But I must have some good sense about it, too. So I smile even when I am about to have a"
C1,"Science flying in the face of gravity Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964 a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircrew gave a tour of the craft inside the cabin. There were no windows, except for the few in the cockpit, which faced a black screen behind a safety wall. But all around the cabin there was weightlessness. The four passengers, aged 11 to 20, looked around and then ran outside to stand on the tarmac and look up at the planes. Some went into the cockpit and did some pilot training. “That’s OK. We’re in space,” a 12-year-old boy joked. There were two flight deck pilots, a flight engineer and a navigator. “It’s my first time!” said one. The KC-135 could carry up to 100,000 litres of fuel. During the flight the crew would monitor fuel levels and also fly to maintain a constant altitude. There was no chance of falling into the abyss below. The Boeing has an unusually shaped fuselage with long wings, which give it a very spacious interior. The passengers sat up front, each with their own reclining seats. Most also had a bunk bed in the cabin and a big screen to which they could watch TV. The children were fascinated by a large fan that was attached to one of the windows. The cabin was divided into two parts by thick white curtains. “There are more things flying than us!” joked one of the older students. The kids climbed aboard the KC-135 to watch it take off"
C1,"The day I drew Picasso Richard Cork recalls how as an 78-year-old student he came face-to-face with one of the most revered artists of the century. Even seen at a distance eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an I8-year-old student filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. We set off for the Riviera from the centre of Bordeaux on a warm late summer evening. We had no real plan and wandered aimlessly through the vineyards in search of food to keep us warm. Picasso and a companion, who had been drinking, saw us from a distance and went into the restaurant for a cigarette. I don’t know if Picasso ever saw the boy drawing on the walls of the restaurant but for the rest of the year I was convinced he saw me too. He made a point of thanking me for sharing our trip. In the end I came to Paris to study architecture but when I met the artist for the first time I knew I’d made the wrong choice of career. In an interview with The Times in 1961 he recalled a brief encounter with a seven-year-old boy who had been given his lunch by Picasso. “I was eating my lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour, and I noticed a little boy there and decided to draw him to amuse myself,” he said. “At first he did not come near me. I tried to attract his attention by talking to him about art and history, and he looked at me for a long time, and then finally, he took off his glove and gave me the sketch.” The boy had never forgotten that moment and, to this day, he still brings the sketch to school every year when it’s due.

C1,"Hit and miss of mass marketing AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.

In the past advertising was the lifeblood of our economy. The only advertisers I knew were those who worked for us, not for a company like McDonalds, Coke, Nike or any other massive corporation that could afford to hire legions of advertising experts.
Instead we saw small, local businesses take on massive ad campaigns, often in languages they didn't speak. For instance, our company spent upwards of 20 hours a day on our own local television station advertising. In other words, we ran a full-fledged advertising operation.

These days, advertising still matters, but it no longer holds the crucial monopoly it once did. The Internet, which allows companies to advertise in a much more creative and targeted manner, is also slowly taking advertising's place. As this economy continues to shrink and the Internet grows, advertising will shrink even more.

So how to stop wasting time and money on advertising when the Internet is here to stay and the people who buy your product are on the Internet every day?
1. Check who is advertising on your website.
2. Check if it's a paid ad.
3. Keep the costs of advertising under control.

What would you do if your company couldn't afford to pay to advertise on the Internet? There are a variety of ways to make the most of the advertising that's free. Keep your costs down by using search engines instead of expensive advertising.
For example, if you own an eCommerce store you can use"
C1,"Plugging in the home Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. She recounts here how she was able to transform the family home into an efficient workplace.
The home where I lived as a kid is now full of computer monitors, and every time my daughter wants to sit and use a computer I have to remind myself: ‘It’s your home!’
There are now a number of computer users in the family. Georgina’s husband, Simon, watches online video tutorials, and her other son is an enthusiast in the latest online gaming fads, spending hours a day playing the latest multiplayer game.
Georgina, in her new role as ‘media officer’ of the family home, has a different role. As a child, I remember having so much fun helping her decorate rooms and draw up plans for new rooms. Now, she has been charged with keeping an eye on technology. In particular, she monitors how the kids use technology, and reports on how the various websites she has registered her children use (e.g. Facebook).
Georgina admits she has been known to sit in the dining room with the TV turned on and watch videos of children playing a game, all while the parents are at work!
We’ve all heard it said that the best way to learn a skill is by doing it. Well, it seems that the best way to do anything is by doing it in front of people. This idea has been drilled into us all from a young age, with us becoming ‘experts’ on many topics as adults. For example, I remember"
C1,"POWER DRESSING EVERY SUMMER the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? The men and the women who run the show, however, know that the world must know just how peacock-like their bird has become. It is the last time the birds will ever be seen in their wild state, not even in cages but hanging from the walls of the park, which itself was named after the birds - who, until the arrival of Europeans in the 18th Century, had been regarded as vermin. But not only their wildness is being celebrated. The birds’ show will now undergo its final curtain call, an experience for which each of the park’s six performers have undergone extensive training and preparation. But before the curtain rises, a few minutes’ warning is provided by the show’s resident peacock, who gives a short message. “Don’t let the chickens get to you, they’re very aggressive,” he says, and then, with the precision of an actor, a warning shot is fired.

In just over three months time, we will see exactly what we feared when the show started - a peacock being shot.
In a further four weeks, we will witness the birth of the babies. Then there is the feeding of the babies, every two minutes at 10am and 12pm, for the first four weeks. If this is all not enough for you, then there is the constant sight of the hens pecking the peacocks to death every hour. At the end"

On this grand evolutionary scale whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. We are no longer the most remarkable animals on the planet. Advertisement 
  
 'But now it's clear that the link with mental ability was strong enough to predict intelligence,' Professor Schiller added. 'Intelligence was present in the earliest hominins as early as six million years ago, and so we may already have an idea of its origin from something as recent as five million years ago.' 
  
 There are at least three species in which intelligence, like height and hair length, is a common trait across all of the population, but the researchers believe that the same kind of genetic similarity may be widespread across all species of early hominins. 
  
 This raises the tantalising possibility that intelligence may have developed through a shared history of interbreeding, rather than through the more common selective breeding methods favoured by modern humans. 
  
 The study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. This includes labelling, and limits the amount of sugar, salt and other additives that may be added to a gum. How it came to be Chewing gum has a fascinating history from the days of the Cherokee Indians, who were so addicted to the bitter flavor of Indian tobacco that they chewed it to ward off malaria, to the silent, unconscious practice of the Chinese who, in the 1850s, used gum as a way to get an afternoon break and relax. Today, gum is sold all over the world and in the United States it is estimated that 12 million sticks are chewed per day. The chew industry was initiated by a group of African men and women in the 1890s who saw the business potential in chewing gum as a way to make money, and they soon started exporting the product. But to maintain an accurate record of the growth of chewing gum, the industry created its own chewing gum industry association, the American Chewing Gum Association, which has since become one of the world’s leading gum manufacturers. The most common chewing gum in the United States is Lucky Strike, which is made in the United States and contains 85% gum. It’s easy to see how the chewing gum industry spread. Chewing gum is so enjoyable that adults will chew 2.5 sticks per day and that’s without dieting. There is a large population in the United States that is sedentary, working in offices or sitting in class, which means that chewing gum is"
C1,"Beginner Takes All Even before it was published The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph The first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer and aspiring director. His debut novel was a flop, the press hated him and his movie rights had not been sold yet. In December of the previous year, the book was withdrawn from print in the USA after an uproar and two lawsuits. It was withdrawn because it included some rather graphic images of horseflesh which many objected to. At the beginning of April, the novel The Horse Whisperer went through its second reissue. In this new edition Evans added a chapter about the success of the book and the movie rights had been sold for 100 million dollars. This was one year to the day since his first book was published. The film rights had been purchased in 1983 but the distribution company pulled out after the first round of litigation with one of its directors. The rights were not sold again for the next seven years. Nicholas Evans went on to write two further novels. The first one, released in 2003 was a big flop and it was withdrawn from publication after a few issues. The sequel, released in 2004, is regarded by many to be the finest of his works and it was even selected as a best book of the year. The film version of the second book came out in 2012 and was highly successful. Evans and his team also started to direct movies. They made an impressive debut at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival with the film The Devil Inside and recently they filmed the adaptation of the acclaimed novel The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.

Tamburlaine the Great Marlowe’s ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands’ staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe’s play with an exhilarating speed and physicality.
For most of the opening two hours of this show, the stage is a river, with actors rushing and tumbling over the rapids and under the waves as they perform their various parts in the fight that ensues. The audience is at the mercy of their rapid moves and frantic choreography, with the pace constantly ratcheted up. They are thrown from high places and hurled through the air at will – or so it seems.
There are some impressive performances but it’s a frantic hour with the action constantly speeding up and the plot never reaching a happy conclusion.
It’s also a big, theatrical show – in fact it would have worked well as a one-man show had Terry Hands stuck to it. But as an event, his production is a spectacular treat that is hard to look away from.
When you have this in mind, and consider the scale of the show and the physical challenges that are inherent in it, it’s easy to see why Mr Spencers decided to tell Marlowe’s story as a saga.
Somewhere in London, Mr Spencer was one of the most dangerous men in England.

C1,"The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It’s a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless that is it is newspapers’ ‘transition’ to the online world an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process – because frankly it may not be a process at all. ‘Print is dying’ is a very uninteresting and tired expression – or is it? It has been around for 100 years, which is longer than it has been on newsprint. If newspapers’ demise doesn’t take us by surprise (and we mustn’t allow the big advertising corporations to have that great feeling), it would certainly lead to its demise. Newspapers have been a constant part of our lives since 1845. During the second world war (or the ‘Great War’ as they call it now), it helped with the survival of the nation and its people. It also provided a vital link between all the world’s news and gave us a much more rounded knowledge of the world we live in. But it also made life on the streets more dangerous, because newspapers were ‘in your face’, with their sensational stories, which could give the police a lot of new evidence and help them with their investigation. But now they are ‘in your face’, no more. Newspapers’ demise means a shift from ‘in your face’ to ‘in your desk’. But then people will have to find a new way to find out what’s going on, if the news from their newspaper is not enough. It will not be the only way. We have television and the internet, but let’s face it, with all that available, it is easy to"

C1,"The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. He tells me he has a background in medicine, is a skilled wood-carver, and his workshop is well appointed. He cuts straight and clean lines in his wooden pieces but his wood is thin. I am impressed that he makes furniture without nails, though the work seems to be slow. As I am not a woodworking expert I can only begin to appreciate these skills. His handiwork is certainly good but not amazing. The most impressive thing about his work is that he makes it with only two hands. There are two assistants, Michael and Mike. Michael cuts the oak that Hurst chooses and Mike cleans up the dust and dings. 'I was made to look after you,' he says. There is no doubt in my mind that I need to ask Michael how Hurst makes the furniture. He looks slightly annoyed that I have interrupted his work to ask. 'The man is a genius and I don't need to be reminded,' Michael replies. He gives me a final tip on the art of wooden furniture making: 'Hurt yourself and you are done for.' I cannot believe that a man can create a table on his knees with only two hands. There is a bit of a lull in the conversation, and when it resumes, I realise my mistake. I have been too inquisitive about a skill and Michael feels I am not giving him enough credit for his hard work. 'Do you have an appreciation for the arts,' I ask. He nods. 'Well"
C1,"Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain’s most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises. The first is Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral Southwell Minster celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house.
The second surprise is the home itself. A ‘coffin house’ built between 1585 and 1590 Southwell was a member of a religious sect led by Robert Howard, the Earl of Chester, later King Henry VIII. Its most famous member was Charles I – and its most controversial was its last and greatest housekeeper. Her name was Elizabeth Tudor and her legend is a perfect match for Southwell.
When Henry VIII died in 1547, the Earl of Leicester and his sons became sovereign. King Henry VIII's famous family at a party celebrating the death of his brother, Henry VIII.
The Earl of Leicester wished to become monarch himself but firstly he needed to marry and, as in Shakespeare’s famous play Henry VIII – The Talents, he found his match. He had been living with and raising his daughter, Anne Boleyn at Southwell for eleven years when he succeeded in getting an order from the Pope to marry his cousin Anne Boleyn.
So, at Southwell he and Anne Boleyn lived on a huge estate and in a spectacular church. Southwell became a model community for the aristocracy and for Catholics and, of course, there was Elizabeth Tudor.
At first Elizabeth had no contact with the world outside her own home. As she got older and had a daughter of her own, however, she began to realise that her life would have a greater impact if she could connect with people. She started to learn"
C1,"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West? Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism massage diet manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions but acupuncture’s role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. However, the medical system of Chinese medicine is not limited to pain and injury. It has the potential to treat mental illnesses from depression to obsessive compulsive disorder.
Ancient Chinese medicine did not rely on drugs or alcohol to treat illness. Instead, it treated the symptoms of the disease and avoided the causes. This meant that it helped to reduce pain and stress. People suffered from less pain due to this. There was less chance of being addicted to drugs. Chinese medicine is not the only type of medicine that can treat illness. Traditional Chinese medicine incorporates other types of therapy to provide maximum benefit to the patient. However, the emphasis was on dealing with the cause of the disease, not the symptoms. This meant that the treatment needed to be non-surgical, gentle and non-drug based.
Medicine was always based on observation. If you were sick you could tell your doctor about it and he would prescribe some sort of treatment. For example, if you were having severe pain in your leg you could tell the doctor that it hurts when you stand up and when you sit down. He would then prescribe some painkillers. This is not the case any more. Today’s medicine relies on controlled experiments and clinical trials. It will try a number of treatments to see what works best. This approach can take a long time but is necessary if we are to have a better understanding of how to treat disease.
It is amazing how much medicine has changed over the last two thousand years."
C1,"The December cover of Capitol Magazine featured Clay Carter looking rich and handsome in his expensive Armani suit. Inside there were pictures of him playing with a dog (borrowed from Rodney) standing proudly in empty courtrooms washing his new Porsche and standing on board his new boat in the Bahamas. This didn't impress Paul Simon at all.
Carter is clearly a bit of a hypocrite - it's clear he's just as happy and comfortable on a budget as he is with a big, expensive car, yacht and party clothes.
""I don't think it's really about who you're wearing, it's about who you're with,"" he said in a 2007 interview with Billboard. ""I think people think that because you're a celebrity, you're automatically wealthy. And I disagree. I'm not wealthy. I've got a good job. I'm comfortable.""
So does this make Paul Simon a hypocrite? Or is it a valid criticism of his lifestyle? In a way, it's both.
Firstly, Simon is a celebrity with lots of wealth and a huge fan base. By ""having it all"", he doesn't necessarily mean he has more than he needs.
""As far as I’m concerned, my private life, I have no time for that. I’ve got enough problems. I don’t have time to go around getting myself into more trouble,"" Simon said in a 2004 interview with Elle US.
""I live a relatively normal life, and I’m not going to complain about it.""
""I haven’t lived a particularly glamorous life. It’s not that glamorous. But I’m pretty comfortable. I’m not the richest guy in the world,"

The image of freshness Supermarkets know from their market research that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They are often surprised that only one in five shoppers will buy the same product more than twice if the store has special offers on products. So, to increase the likelihood of shoppers making two purchases, supermarkets are constantly offering special offers. What many shoppers don’t know is that supermarkets use sophisticated software to predict which items they will be most likely to buy, even if they are already in the store. They also employ special robots that can detect the exact best time to push an item towards the checkout. A.

C1,"A. 'I actually look rather good in jeans. So I rarely wear them. I don't want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.’ So runs the logic of Isabel 'our heroine’ in this refreshingly zany novel. An art student of 31 devotee of historical romances she seeks Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances. The story begins at the start of the French Revolution and is played out through the characters and situations which the reader, in a way, is experiencing. Isabel is caught up in the political upheaval as is her friend and fellow artist, Jacques. Their housekeeper, Madame Degraine, is equally as captivated by the revolutionaries and her dreams of escaping to Switzerland. She finds refuge in one of the rooms in the house and the story begins with her, but her escape does not last long. The revolutionaries come for her too and Isabel must use her wit and charm to get out of their clutches, even if it means being burned alive. At last she comes to the aid of Jacques, a political refugee, who is just as eager to escape from the political turmoil as Isabel. The three join forces, escaping into the countryside and finding work as labourers but in the midst of all this Isabel meets her old lover, François. Isabel, Jacques and Francois are together again but their happiness is short-lived when Isabel’s mother-in-law, the Duchess of Artois, unexpectedly appears. She comes to the house and takes possession of Isabel’s house with the intention of evicting François, who she considers a criminal in her son’s eyes and Isabel has nowhere to go, and Francois is arrested. The trio is brought to the city council who are intent on executing both Jacques and François in order to make way for the rich Marquis de Lalaing"
C1,"Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. Some studies suggest that sleep helps to build memory, some studies suggest that sleep helps to maintain mental health, and still others suggest that sleep helps us to recover from the stresses of the day. Here we take a look at the most commonly accepted theories and examine some of the limitations of some of them. In particular, we take a closer look at the influence of circadian rhythm on sleep duration. 

Sleep, or at least the time that you are asleep, is critical for normal human functioning, it is thought. During sleep, the body produces a number of hormones, such as adrenaline (which contributes to our heart beat); cortisol (which helps to regulate our blood sugar levels); and histamine (which regulates the immune system), which helps to fight infection. So if a person is unable to sleep properly, these things cannot function properly. If you are reading this article you must be aware that not sleeping is not something that can be fixed overnight. If you cannot manage to be satisfied with just eight hours a night, you should make an effort to improve the quality of your sleep. 

Now as for why people sleep so much... There is no clear evidence, yet, about why we sleep so much. Perhaps the answer lies in our internal clock. We don't have a single ""internal clock"". Our circadian rhythm, the biological clock of our internal body, controls our sleep, wake and appetite cycles. The biological clock of the internal body is thought to synchronize with our external"
C1,"Is your office working ok? Fresh air and the right chairs are the key to a happy healthy workforce according to a new survey. We went to four contrasting offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist who studies people’s working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. They all agreed that healthy and happy employees are more productive and happier at work. 

The survey results show that the first thing people look for when choosing an office is its fresh air intake. Just under half of the respondents (47.8%) said this was an important factor for choosing a workspace, just ahead of air conditioning (43.2%) and Wi-Fi (42.1%).

One of our expert panelists found this to be the most surprising, finding that a good amount of people work in unheated offices, in fact one in three (32.7%) work in unheated offices all year round and the other half (57%) don’t bother. He also added that the first thing he’d do when choosing an office is to look for an open plan office so that people can see people across the floor.

We also asked the panelists about what type of environment they would rather work in and, interestingly, our building had the least amount of employees who wanted an open plan office. Only 14% of the respondents said they would prefer one instead of a split plan. On the other hand, the most preferred environment was one with a cubicle. 

The building health and ergonomics consultant on the panel said it was clear that when people are working in an open plan office they can’t get enough fresh air and are too close to their colleagues, they tend to ‘hear�"

C1,"THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING I thought everyone would be pleased but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. ‘What do you mean?’ she raged. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day life-long smoker and four hours later I was not was faintly irritating. Maybe I should have explained, if only to make sure she did not continue to be angry. However, I was now looking at a life time of abstinence, a lifetime of not having to worry if I was running low on nicotine. ‘What will you do without smoking?’ ‘I’ll live. I’ll lead a normal life,’ I said. It was true – I was not depressed and was no longer suffering with nicotine withdrawal. ‘It’s so wonderful to be able to eat an apple or chocolate. I miss all the junk food,’ she protested, ‘but I’m not going to be able to afford it.’ I agreed that I would not be able to buy unhealthy food for a while and we decided that smoking could not be stopped completely. My colleague had one more question. ‘Why do you say you are addicted to nicotine?’ ‘I smoked a packet a day for ten years,’ I said, ‘I was addicted, you see. There was no way to stop the habit.’ She seemed not to understand the point I was trying to make. Then it came to me: I remembered the advice from a friend who had tried quitting smoking. He had said: ‘If you’ve had one cigarette, don’t have another. You’ll only be tempted to smoke when your back is against the wall."
C2,"Writing by hand and on screen Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over. To be in the minority of the English-speaking world, however, is to be in a minority of life.
This doesn’t mean that every passage must be written with the help of a screenwriter (although the advantages of their script can’t be overstated), but the idea that it’s an essential skill to have – in fact a necessary one - seems a strong claim. I still do most of my writing on paper, but I’ve written (in fact still do) quite a few screenplays, most recently the BBC TV adaptation of Michael Morpurgo’s biography of Charles Dickens. I’m constantly amazed by the quality of scripts I get in response to my e-mail or phone correspondence with script writers, including some of the best I know.
I’m also a regular user of the screenwriter toolkit provided by my favourite writers and publishers: for my first draft I use the version of screenwriting software, Storyline, produced by Hollywood veteran Robert Zemeckis. For the final draft I use the free version of Screenwriter for Windows by Jonathan Kasdan and his company WME.
These are not professionals, nor have they had years of training and education behind them. Some are still working in their twenties. I’d be very surprised if anyone could answer the question ‘can you write a good screenplay?’ convincingly, but if they can, then I’"
C2,"Philadelphia Avenue I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened the humidity thickened into a palpable prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. A few blocks later I reached what appeared to be my destination: a little, brick building with a few boarded up windows, a single, ornate doorway that glistened in the fading light from the surrounding lamp-posts. Looking for a place to eat I approached the door, which was propped slightly ajar. ‘Hello,’ I said. ‘It’s me.’ ‘Can I help you?’ It was a small man, barely over six feet tall. ‘I’d like some food,’ I said. ‘I’ve been looking all around. Do you mind if I wait for someone?’ ‘No problem. Go right in,’ I said, with a small smile, and opened the door. ‘Would you like a lemonade or hot chocolate?’ ‘No, thanks.’ The man entered into the warm, moist, cozy interior. He was warm and comfortable. There was a soft sound, soft enough to be almost asleep, of the shutters of the old brick building, and the soft whisper of distant rain. He seemed almost at home. He was still warm, and I could feel the rich, sooty aroma of the freshly baked bread and scones. And the rich scent of homemade preserves that hung from the counter, dripping in a glass bowl from the old glass windows that looked over the street. I was hungry"
C2,"Einstein Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist and the chances are they’ll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias. So why not advertise with his name? Because he didn’t. He lived a long and active life but is mostly remembered for his theories of relativity. Even though there was no conclusive evidence to back these theories up. They still seem very relevant today. However, there is good evidence that his ideas were indeed tested and proved with some success. Here are just five facts about Einstein you may not have known before.
1. In 1905 he moved to Berlin from Basel and set up his own business.
2. In 1908 he moved to Bern to work for the French mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré.
3. In 1910 Einstein and his brother left Paris to go to Switzerland because they were worried about their father who was mentally ill.
4. In 1912 he went to Berlin to complete a book about his theories of relativity.
5. In 1921 Einstein and several other scientists formed the Association for the Study of Special Relativity.

This was the first time Albert Einstein actually went public with his theories of relativity.
He was only 28 years old when he decided to do this as he was becoming very sick and tired of not being taken seriously. He had also been working in Switzerland for a while on his theories.
Einstein made an impact on both fields of science. In the field of physics he created the theory of special relativity and this allowed for all of the above. His theories were the first to be tested and proved scientifically. His theory on"
C2,"Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. And there are vast numbers of new astronomical books and catalogues. There has also been an astonishing expansion in our knowledge of the physical processes at work in the universe. It is no longer necessary to rely on the theory of general relativity to describe the vast array of physical phenomena in the universe, as was the case when Einstein first proposed it 60 years ago. These advances in understanding have led us to the development of more complex observational techniques, such as gravitational waves, high-energy cosmic rays, black holes, neutron stars and supermassive black holes, among others. Since the advent of these new observational techniques, some new and exciting new astronomy questions have emerged. Astronomers are beginning to explore how the universe works, and how it evolved in the early universe. This involves both looking into the early history of the universe and studying the more recent history of the universe, as well as investigating the present state of our universe. This is all leading to a more in-depth understanding of the history of the universe, and how it has unfolded. There is much uncertainty in the physical laws governing our universe, and the study of these laws is therefore a crucial element of understanding the present and past of the universe, as well as planning the future of astronomy. Another important aim of astronomy is to study the properties of cosmic rays, which play a major role in the origin and evolution of life in our universe. We must understand how particles of matter, including carbon and oxygen, react to cosmic rays. As is well"
C2,"Art In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique revolutionary shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago. This is especially true about contemporary artists. However, sometimes the artist has become over-hyped to the point that they are often ridiculed - the artist themselves are usually forced to defend their work against the critics. In fact, sometimes there's nothing wrong with criticizing the art of an artist, so long as we don't forget that the criticism has to have substance, which is more important than just the ""flavor"" of the criticism. We feel the same about music. We are quite fond of saying ""I like your music"", but more important than the music is the artist. It's really important that an artist gets out of his way and starts showing that he's got something interesting to say and that he can actually develop and change. So, when we say that ""we like your music"", we're actually expressing our sincere opinion. However, people often think that if they like what we like then they must like it too. When we hear about a new great rock band, we often hear a lot of the same songs and we often hear the same band's sound. It doesn't mean we must like it or that it has to be our type of music, but we can be critical of it and know that it's not an important thing. So, when we say, ""your music is great"", we're not just being nice to you, we're also expressing our genuine opinion. Of course, we may not know that you wrote a book or a movie or a song"
C2,"Fashion Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point. However, the history of fashion is also made up of earlier episodes of social interaction. There were social rituals which were also crucial to the way we see and experience fashion. There is therefore the need for our study of fashion to be as much a social one as it is an archaeological one. However, this need not prevent us from looking at a fashion situation in past societies. The history of fashion can help us to make a better understanding of past societies. And it can provide us with models by which to study the present fashion situation. This is because it is fashion in the past which enabled us to imagine the present-day fashion situation. In particular, fashion offers us with a rich historical background which makes it suitable for analysis by social scientists and archaeologists. Furthermore, fashion is a very important social process, both in the past and in the present. This is because fashion is a social phenomenon and its impact on society depends upon the social structure. If we wish to better understand society, we need to know how and why fashion occurs. This is because if we want to understand society better, we need to know how people interact and socialise. In fact, it is the interaction between social groups that is key to the emergence of different social structures. So, to understand how people socialise, we need to know how people socialise in the past. We can use this knowledge to get a better understanding of how we can better understand society. Furthermore, by knowing how people socialise, we can"
C2,"Metals It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. These small pieces of stone would then be smeared with honey and baked for an enjoyable snack. It would probably have been a rare find to encounter such a pebble, but one might not expect that an ancestor would actually carve it into a weapon. Some tools were certainly carved with great skill; stone axes and swords were probably used, and this was a valuable skill. It would have been an opportunity to show off and it would have been a means of survival. It was an early use of the hammer and chisel. There is an assumption that the tools were found in small flocks, such as a rock pile, or left by people. This was to be a common activity of early settlers; they would gather wood for cooking and make a fire and when they left they would leave some with the birds. Many would have left the pebbles in their tool kit in an attempt to impress their mates. A very early use of the chisel and hammer, probably with some type of wood. These were probably made from trees such as cedars and oak. We know that the first tool could have been a stick used to crush bones. However, it is important that we do not read too much into this as some evidence is a bit weak. Some have suggested that it was probably stone that we find in stone age graves. We do not know and this is an area where there is still much uncertainty. It was probably not metal that made the graves, but stone. It"
C2,"The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. My favorite moments were when it fell into the right light and the color, depth and texture in a photograph were as rich as life itself. But when I took photographs, I could never have imagined that any of these photographs would be one of the most iconic images of our time.
My first assignment in Vienna was in 1974. It was a year of transition in this city. As war was raging all around the world, Vienna was the perfect place to find some peace and calm. There was so much to photograph and so little time, so I took my camera and started walking around, looking for light, trying to get a shot of something I saw every day. But the best light, for me, was when I caught the eye of one of my friends who was working in a shop on the other side of the street. In our brief conversation, I found out he was a fashion photographer. A few months later, he called me on the phone. “I have a job for you,” he said. I had been a student since high school and had taken quite a few fashion assignments, but this was something new. He explained the photograph he was looking for and then gave me a few minutes to prepare. We left to meet the client and went down the street a few minutes later.
I walked into the shop to meet him. He had photographed a wedding in our town and had called up to see if I wanted to model for him. It had been a"
C2,"Enough Sleep? Tiredness it is often claimed has become the modern condition. As the richer busier countries have grown so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings. But does sleep really mean what it used to? Are sleep-deprivation disorders a new disease category? What do sleep-deprivation disorders actually involve? Do we really need seven to nine hours a night? What other health benefits of sleep can we claim to derive from longer sleep time? These are some of the questions which have been put to the experts who have examined the evidence in this area. The result has been a new book which sets out a case for a new classification of sleep-deprivation disorder based on the number of hours people sleep. Sleep is generally understood to have a circadian rhythm, with a biological rhythm arising from the internal body clock in mammals. It is generally agreed that sleep cycles in mammals are in a 24-hour cycle and each of the 24 hours includes a roughly three to five hours of daily wakefulness and a roughly five to six hours of nightly sleep. The amount of sleep the individual needs varies with the stage in life, with a minimum amount needed for maximum energy levels. This is why it is important to get a minimum of eight hours per night for a normal adult. But as most people grow older their sleep needs increase. In an attempt to measure the amount of sleep people need to feel rested, the International Sleep Education Society created the Standards of International Sleep Research (SI-SERS) which are defined as the total sleep duration required to be fully relaxed. SI-SERS can be divided into two classes: short sleep and normal sleep."
C2,"Air-conditioning There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer’s unusually high temperatures the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so in fact that at quiet times the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. And that’s before any of the other indoor spaces are added to the bill. The result is a sweaty, over-the-top environment that I’d happily sacrifice for better summer weather. However, it’s been going on for so long that it’s a bit of a given that more of this sort of over-the-topness is on the way. To its credit, Cannons has decided to have a look and see if it can make something more palatable. It’s doing this with the opening of its third gym. The first two are already popular – and there are more due in the autumn. This one, due to open next April, will focus on strength training and offer high-intensity workouts. And with that kind of thing comes a very important and overdue adjustment to the way the gym feels. You will get a wider range of workout equipment in this one. Gone will be the high-pressure equipment on the ellipticals and machines. It will be more of a gym in the modern sense – a place where fitness is a part of everyday life, a place where you can go if you want to do some basic cardiovascular work, some strength training and some light weight-lifting. There will be no machines or ellipticals in this gym. What you will find is a much wider choice of equipment. And that is because as an over-45s market Cannons must do something about its reputation for being a boring gym"
C2,"THE WELL I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched eyes wide fist to mouth as I winched up the well bucket steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. We made it to the top and I turned the bucket upside down as high as I dared, looking for anything that might give me an edge. “Hey man, that’s a good idea, but the water’s too cold!” I heard you say, and then I saw it: a small pool that looked warm enough for a drink. “You’re right, the water’s still just right.” I took a swallow of the cool water and then turned the bucket upside down in search of something else, but I had to leave quickly, as the sun was rising. Your laughter, as I left, gave me the boost I needed. It was at that moment when I started walking in a straight line toward where you stood. I saw you the whole way and it made me smile. I kept walking until I got to your house. At the back of the yard I saw that the pool was full. I heard you call back to me, “Look, there’s a star on my shoe!” “Yeah, you’ve caught the star light!” I answered. We ran up the steps to your porch and there, just at the top of the porch steps, was a brilliant shining star. “I know you’re right, I feel it. I can see it. I will be rich!” I said, as you shook my hand tightly."
C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day.

""Hello."" He said to the open door.

""What?"" The door said back.

""Hello."" He repeated.

The doorknob rattled a little in its silence.

""Hello."" Again, the door answered.

And a silence enveloped them, which remained till the man in the suit left and the door swung closed on him.

Ralph wondered whether anyone else had ever felt such a strange, almost personal, awareness of their own mortality. The feeling persisted as he drove home the rest of the afternoon. 

When he returned to his home, he found that his wife, Ruth, was waiting for him. She was tired but had made an elaborate supper and would have gone to bed by now had he not been so insistent.

""I just couldn't wait,"" she told him. ""As it happens I'm a big fan of yours.""

""Why do you think that's?""

""I've seen all your pictures. Your work is just so... real. It's... "" 

""That's because I care so much about what I do. I know that this house is all yours, and I know that it's not going to get a lot of people looking at it, because I care about how it looks, too. And I knew I had to do something about it. So I made these changes."" She held up a photo of her and"
C2,"Heritage The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously we feel connected to our personal heritage usually we know who and what our grandparents were and we will have heard stories about how they lived. Heritage gives the community pride in its surroundings and a link to its past.
Heritage in itself is not a valuable asset in itself, it’s not like a fossil or a rock, rather it’s a legacy. It’s more important for it’s heritage to be preserved and protected for future generations and to share it with others than to get money or benefits from it. There are benefits of keeping heritage, for example it helps to reduce pollution.
Heritage preservation is one of the main strategies of many organisations. It helps to educate people and to develop their knowledge of heritage. It is not only beneficial in preserving heritage but also for the promotion of tourism. It helps to preserve our heritage and keep people interested in it.
I think that heritage is good as it contributes to the growth of the economy. It brings the community together and gives hope and positive energy. It gives people a sense of belonging and pride in their heritage. It keeps our identity alive.
A heritage day is a great occasion to let people know about the heritage and appreciate it. Heritage is a source of inspiration for many other activities. Heritage has a great importance in our society. Without heritage the future will be different.
Heritage should be kept alive. People should not damage it. I think that heritage should be protected and preserved.

C2,"Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare’s play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I felt that the play itself was not that great a piece but fearon and his co-star, Mark Rylance, had a fine time onstage as Othello and I was pleased to see that they succeeded in portraying the character’s humanity. At the time I also thought that the set was a bit small and did not offer any visual interest. Now I am inclined to think otherwise. At the present moment I am not particularly impressed by this new production but the actors deserve some credit and the staging is certainly more exciting than that of last spring. Director Philip James is giving the actors ample time onstage and giving them the chance to deliver memorable speeches. He also has done a fine job of creating a convincing and exciting setting. However, I still do not entirely get what Othello’s problem is. I do not think the plot is particularly complex and there is no doubt that Shakespeare left plenty of room for misinterpretations. Othello, therefore, has to make up his own mind before he can make an informed choice. In addition to his own conscience, Othello also has to make sure he can take up the challenge imposed by his wife Desdemona. The latter is a dangerous person and does not always keep her word. However, in this play, she is clearly an aggressor and, thus, deserves punishment. The story thus goes forward. Othello can commit suicide after having saved the life of Desdemona but at this point we"
C2,"The Wrong Country Uncle chose for them a package holiday at a very reasonable price: a flight from Gatwick Airport twelve nights in Venice the fairyland city in the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went together to the travel agency to make the booking the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast all of them learning Italian. In a little while the group got there and it was impossible to find a seat so it turned out that they could not all go together. The problem was solved because they had the ticket to the first and last flight but still they had to go to the airport every evening. Uncle Dave told Dawne that they should be at the airport before departure and that he would walk to the departure gate with them. When they arrived at the airport they saw the school group arrive and was very disappointed because one of them was a great friend of Keith and he was afraid to tell his friends that he was going to miss the flight, because his friends had to come with him to the airport in the evening every single day. When Keith went to walk to the departure gate Uncle Dave took him behind a counter and told him to get a room for the next twenty-four hours, they were there. When Keith was alone with the counter clerk she told him that she had a boyfriend. Keith didn't ask who he was or what her name was, but she said she was always jealous of him and they could only talk to each other behind his back. Keith knew that he was dreaming, so he kept calm and told her that he would find a room. Uncle Dave told him he was going to find something for her. When Keith asked about rooms in this strange hotel she told him that they had a lot of beds but Uncle Dave was going to have to go around the whole building to find a room for her"
C2,"Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal. Although they are animals that share a close association with people, the lion has a curious absence from our popular imagination. For several reasons. First, it is not considered an important species by some. For instance, while a human has around 1 in 15 billion chances to be killed by a lion, that of a lioness is one in 3 billion; for a lion hunting for food, the odds are about 1 in 6 billion. Second, to the wider public lions are a menace, a symbol of poverty and instability. Indeed, some see the great cat as a living symbol of Africa's ills, a reminder of how wild and violent the continent can be. Advertisement.
The animals, however, are as capable of thinking as any other brain. They are not stupid or moronic as humans tend to imagine, says Dr Nesher. 'Lions need to be fed, they need to eat. And they can actually think about what they are going to do next,' he explains. Advertisement.
One of the most important tasks a wild carnivore can perform is to find prey. A lion, for example, can use all of its senses - seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling - to pick its target. This can take a long time.
'Every day you might have a big hunt, and you might spend several hours searching for the same prey,' Dr Nesher says. 'It's an incredible amount of time.'
Another important part of the hunting process is"
C2,"Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. Tito’s plan for the mission, named Project Mars (Mars Orbiter Mission), has a team of experts and designers working hard to put this dream trip together. The final product will include a three-man crew and a spacecraft, plus various spacecraft hardware, instruments and the crew’s daily routine. It will likely have a duration of about 4.5 months at an altitude of about 200km above Mars, and about 30 hours per day of exploration. Although not required, such people would obviously bring along all kinds of science instruments and equipment. The astronauts will be living in a habitat that will be mounted on the lander and the crew module that is expected to land on Mars after the arrival of the Mars Orbiter. The crew module will carry the astronauts, their equipment, spare parts, and food. A second habitat (for the scientists and engineers) will be attached to the lander and will stay at a higher altitude. If there is enough money left over, the project will also have the possibility of including a Mars landing vehicle and its crew of four. These four humans will live on the lander for a total of about 6 months. It will be interesting to see what sort of equipment is required for an expedition to Mars, but I guess there will not be too many differences between the equipment used for the moon mission and the Mars mission. I would also imagine the amount of science and research needed for an expedition to Mars will be even more than that needed for"
C2,"Garbage in garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be. Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip.
In many American cities the local rubbish man is paid a low salary and the amount of his wages is fixed. The residents of a neighbourhood then collect the rubbish that their man has been taking away. The amount he is paid is fixed. This means that, in many cases, even if you are a resident of the neighbourhood it pays not to clean up after your man. There is some advantage to this system as well, however: the more rubbish a locality has, the less need there is to send out a rubbish man and the less time and money is devoted to the task.
The local rubbish man is required to collect every kind of rubbish, including, of course, garden and rubbish cans, litter, etc. In rural areas it may also include wood waste and old tyres. He is paid in accordance with the volume of refuse he removes. In city areas he may be paid by the cubic yard, but it is usually cheaper to collect it in pieces.
In many American cities there are some exceptions to this rule: for example, in New York City the residents are required to pay a small levy on the amount of rubbish they generate, and so, through their council, to provide rubbish collection.
In most American cities the garbage man also collects the recyclable material. You could easily imagine a future in which the households in your neighbourhood collected only recyclable materials. The garbage man would collect only the other rubbish and the council would collect only recyclable materials.

C2,"Goat Racing I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans hordes of people food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. I soon saw the start line, the crowd was still very packed but this would soon quieten down, the crowd now was much smaller and had only one intention the race. I had been watching the race for years, I have seen the runners and seen them getting closer and closer to the finish line. At about ten minutes before the start of the race the announcer said that it was time to get ready, the music was loud and the marshalls were calling the runners to a start. I had to shout out for the marshalls to wait for me as my glasses were still in my purse. I ran to the end of the race where the marshalls were located and they had gathered. The marshalls got down off their stands and began walking the course calling for the runners. I ran up to them and asked if I could run with them, they seemed surprised to say the least and they just smiled, it was very friendly to have a stranger follow them around the racecourse. The racecourse had around thirty stands that had been set up for the race and the crowd was now massed around them. The stands were in various stages of disarray, it was difficult to see the runners and they were in different positions. We were soon calling out their names, one by one they would come running down the course. I was still in a crowd and only ran up the final few metres of the course before joining the marshalls. They had finished the course and all the runners were heading"
C2,"0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. At the very least, historians sometimes fail to listen to the witness and ignore the context for their own purposes. It is important for historians to ensure that the interviewee is not subject to undue influence, and that the interviewee is not biased by pre-existing ideas about the past. 
  
 As with all human endeavours, the process of conducting an interview will vary with the personality of the witness, the subject matter of the testimony and the researcher’s expectations. For example, a participant may reveal information or behaviour of no interest, or may have an interesting account but no useful information to add. The witness may say nothing of any use, provide useful but irrelevant information, or provide useful information but not of any immediate interest to the researcher. For this reason it is important for an interviewer to be tolerant, flexible and sensitive in conducting the interview. There is a particular case when the interviewee and the interviewer are at a crossroad, and it is important to respect that momentary pause and listen to the witness’s point of view. 
  
 There are different kinds of oral interviews, and interviews conducted for historical research may vary according to the purpose of the interview, the time and the medium in which it is conducted. 
  
 An interview conducted for historical research may be the best form of oral testimony as it allows for a frank exchange of information and allows the interviewer to identify relevant background information that could not be found in the original"

Her excuse for forgetting such things was that he wasn’t normally supposed to be there. But you never knew when some of his friends or their families might want their tea in sugar.'Lancelot had been the chief surgeon at the Hospital of Saint Luke, near London, for many years. He had run it with his wife Susannah, a competent nurse. Now she retired and took up her position as governess at All Souls' school in a quiet rural village where she was popular with the children. Lancelot liked teaching the younger ones, as he was fond of telling Susannah; they would have a great future. It seemed to help their popularity with their schoolteacher, Mr. Smith, that one of the children had recently won a prize at another school, which Mr. Smith thought very well for the boy to have. He was often given the same prizes by All Saints. This was an opportunity that he had been eager to take, and he was especially proud when the school was asked to collect all the prizes for the next exhibition. It was always an enormous job to collect the prizes, in which all schools were interested. He took the opportunity to send Lancelot and Susannah away early on the morning of the event. He took the boys to a nearby country club, where he told them the news. Then he and Susannah went for a walk, to let the news take effect. The following day, they all met again in his office. There was much laughter over the prizes. And then the moment of truth came. He told them,

C2,"REMOVAL DAY With her children now grown widowed Susan faces leaving the family home. The van said Susan noticed ‘Removers of Distinction’ and indeed every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables and his team of helpers not so gentle. Mrs Henschke, however, was not to be hurried. She read all the newspapers in the house carefully looking for the one which she could sell and for which she might buy a more comfortable home. Mrs Henschke found it, so at last the day of her departure was confirmed. She wrote a letter of resignation in the hand which had held hers all these years and packed away everything else she had left. She then threw the letter away. The removal men arrived about eleven. Susan had written the letter just as the men arrived. The day she had finally left she had written the letter in the hand with which she had held it all these years. To everyone present it had appeared as a real resignation. After she had written it the van had been loaded and the last of the family were driven away to start their new life. The removal vans drove in silence to the site of a new house being constructed on a larger land estate but it was near to the family home. Everyone was sad to see Susan go. The family were glad the move was finally over. They were still to leave but it was not too late. The next day the children, now adults, met on the small patch of grass near the old house for the last time. Everyone was sad to leave but it was only just after the farewell tea when they looked up and saw the house ahead of them with the white awning and red bricks on the ground. Mrs Henschke, in"
C2,"Screen Learning A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. ‘I’m a little dinosaur’ he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. Then he revealed his favourite dinosaur was Triceratops. He’d seen a Triceratops statue in London and he asked me to get it for him. ‘I’ve been dreaming of it!’ he said. There are many children’s books with Triceratops in them. His dinosaur was in the front of the Little Tikes Big Dinosaur Adventure Play set (see review). Our first stop was an art gallery, and next up was a Chinese restaurant. There’s really no way that dinosaur could eat a meal of noodles! It’s not very tall, the dinosaur has two hooves and it has a beak in its mouth. It also lacks teeth, although the dinosaur has a funny-looking, wagging tail. I thought this dinosaur might be a little too real to eat real noodles, even though children are used to it. That’s okay though, this is a cartoon. I wanted the dinosaur to know it was just a cartoon, not real life. The last meal he has for a while. I showed him how to make eggnog and a little bit of chocolate. He helped to mix it all up and then he tried it himself. He didn’t really want to. He put some water into a bowl and put some chocolate in it. ‘I want something else to have.’ ‘I made a funny noise!’ he shouted. It wasn"
C2,"Build it yourself at the UK’s first bamboo bike workshop A course at the Bamboo Bike Club run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan buys you a computer-designed custom frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building.
The Bamboo Bike Club is an engineering-led group with the mission of creating an ever-growing, inclusive, and fun community for builders, crafters, and cyclists.
Our courses have been running since 2014 at King's College in central London. A two-day workshop is designed for builders and bike-builders, as well as for cyclists, and has a lot to teach, including techniques for using the latest bamboo, carbon fibre, wood, and stainless steel materials.
Every workshop has four hours of workshop time, followed by a weekend for building. A “building day” is an important part of building any piece of kit, and is one of the best ways to create a lasting attachment to your new machine, to the people working on it, and to the community that surrounds it. Building day is a chance to get creative and spend quality time with friends and fellow enthusiasts, rather than to work and concentrate on a project alone for days on end.
Our building workshop has all you need - an all-inclusive frame, a quality toolskit, advice on choosing materials, and some bamboo bikes already on the frame! A two-day workshop costs £2,500. The building day costs £350.
Choose to spend £2500 on a 2-day course and building day, or choose to pay £2,000 and build a fully custom bike yourself. A one-day workshop costs £450. For more information or to register your interest,"
C2,"Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. The dominant monkey soon returned to his place. But when the stranger came around in the other direction, one of the vervets shot him a death-blow with his long, sharp teeth. The dominant monkey seemed indifferent. “We thought this was odd: a group of monkeys doing a little hunting and maybe taking something to eat. It wasn’t until we got closer that we realised the stranger was a human in disguise.” Once the monkeys had killed him, “we could see it was a man” who had come to the jungle looking for food. That was four years ago, in December 2014. The killer monkeys still won’t let him near the female monkeys. The Vervet Monkey Project wants us to help it understand the reasons for the death. Did this human go in search of food, or was there a conflict between humans and the vervet monkeys? Is there a new human living in the jungle where the monkeys have no contact? Or was the man lured to the place where he was killed? Did the vervet monkeys kill him with their own teeth? Are they looking for revenge? What was the man’s purpose in visiting the jungle? Why was he killed? Was it by a female? Was it by a rival group of monkeys, or could it be that a man was killed by the vervet monkeys? Are there still humans living in the jungle? I have no idea. The best I can think of is that maybe"
C2,"AESTHETICS By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. That is why when people in theory are writing about paintings or sculptures or drawings they refer to things that exist outside themselves. It is easier to write than to think of an image or a memory or a smell as an actual object or entity and then write in a way that allows one to apprehend that object or entity. I therefore try to find a middle ground between these two extremes. I have tried to combine the fact that the form of the object must be apprehended as an actual entity with the fact that the object must have some intrinsic meaning. It is necessary to understand the object of art and its objectivity. Then we must be able to see some form of meaning in the object itself. In order to do that we must be able to imagine the process and then in a way visualize it. That has been my aim. I hope to show that these works of art may be made to have a certain function which requires some imagination. Aesthetic studies, theoretical or practical, cannot be limited to images and ideas alone, they should include a certain process, an objectivity and a subjectivity, a relation between the human beings who think about the work of art and the objects of art and an interrelation between theory and practice. I believe that in order to see what I mean by that we have to study more of the objects themselves and not only look at what they look like. We have to be able to imagine what process might be used to make them into something we can actually understand and appreciate"
C2,"Sand Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face gets in your sandwiches and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. One of the latest examples is this sculpture at the British Museum that I saw recently. It was titled ""Sandstorm"", it was made out of various natural materials including limestone and lime and it stood on top of the sand. It took about a year to create and cost about 20 million pounds. You could argue that it is quite beautiful, but I think it is rather useless as it stands. As we all know sand is not a great conductor of heat, and it seems the sand is just there for decoration rather than for insulation. This is particularly true if it is made of limestone which would be the case with sandstorm, it acts as a conductor. It is no surprise then that over the years people have come up with various solutions to this problem. In my view one of the most obvious ones has been the creation of insulating sand. This has to be the most obvious way of reducing the conductivity of sand. A simple idea to reduce the conductivity of sand is to turn the material into glass-like structures that can actually conduct electricity. This would essentially mean creating sand glass. It is rather an interesting idea that can be applied in a variety of ways, one of the more interesting ways being through sandcastles. However, one of the problems with these sandcastles is that they are made from limestone, which can be a very expensive material. If this is the most obvious solution then there must be other ideas out there. I guess we will never know, as it"
C2,"Art on TV Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details. It doesn't matter who the artist is, or what they are doing. They have got to be more interesting than a painting that covers the same ground over and over. Painting and sculpture are so much more exciting and engaging to watch than reality TV. 
  
 The answer lies in our culture of instant gratification. We want to see the finished product. With reality TV it is never just the finished product, it is always an ongoing process where each episode must always be an amazing revelation. We want to see the finished product. 
  
 Reality TV, like painting and sculpture, should be more interesting than a painting that covers the same ground over and over. 
  
 Let's be honest. The paintbrush isn't the most exciting tool in the world to watch. 
  
 If we could go back in time and had the chance to change the way the world works then maybe we wouldn't just paint the same old same old. We would actually paint some truly spectacular art. Let's make TV great again.

C2,"The Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. Many actors have done the “actors’ craft” derision on TV shows such as The Young Ones and The Archers, so it isn’t a surprise to find a similar tone here. However, the vitriol is particularly loud and bitter this time round, coming straight from the mouths of the members of the theatre company itself. The actor’s guilds are generally considered to be bastions of professional actors and I’m sure they’re usually as nice as you’ll ever get. Well, this is an exception to the rule.
From the opening scenes, there is no attempt by the cast to make us believe this is anything other than a straightforward parody. It’s a simple gag that has been recycled in every show for decades, a classic gag of which is “the theatre is run by lunatics”. In most cases it is the director’s idea to do this, not the actors. In other cases it’s a gag written and set by the actors and rehearsed by the cast. In the first case, the opening is set out by the director, in the second case the cast rehearses it together, and, in the last case, the actors improvise a bit. There are no clues as to which direction was chosen for any of the sketches except in the opening scenes.

C2,"Work Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change. Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood and even among individuals who have won eminence there is often bitterness behind the fame. One example is the American business writer and sociologist Zeldin. He thinks that in his profession of economic analyst one is not sufficiently valued and recognised. In the first place, it is hard to get a job as a researcher. And as the specialist he must also take on additional work as economist, economist and sociologist. “It’s a lot like teaching” says Zeldin. “Only I have to give up my teaching post and concentrate on all my work as sociologist.” When I ask him about his work he is extremely proud. He has written several books, which are popular worldwide. “Our society has become highly complex and more and more people are very interested in economic problems. These subjects have not been written about properly before.” In the United States there are many books written by Zeldin on such subjects as the value of work, salaries, working conditions and pensions. He is also interested in the working life of people from different backgrounds and countries. He has travelled all over the world and he is always interested in the cultures and ideas of other cultures. “Many interesting things happen in our society and many of them I write about in my books.” He thinks that one day our society will have to know how much it is valued and appreciate this. I have asked him if he ever regrets not having had a traditional job. “What is the good of a traditional job? Why should I work only"
C2,"Language You and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth they will soon be exchanging words.  If people had no language we could certainly not understand each other, yet there is a great deal of variation among human languages. It is believed that about 80-90% of languages are not fully understood by their speakers. There are so many different language speakers, the total number of known languages is believed to be as much as 500,000. This is remarkable, because there are only 10,000 known languages in the world! And each language can represent completely a different culture and its values. When I look into the eyes of someone who speaks an unknown language I find a great deal of magic. I have heard stories about two men who lived in a remote village in the Canadian Arctic. These men did not communicate much with each other. They lived separately and had little contact with other people. However they knew one another by name, and one day when the other men were not in the village they found the man with whom they shared their special name. As they made their way home the man with the special name was accompanied by a hunter who had been tracking the animal they were looking for.  As they passed a group of Eskimos the hunter recognized the man's name and was able to tell the two men where to go. They made it safely to the village, and one by one the two men spoke to the other men and they were able to understand one another. They discussed the recent events that had taken place. One night as they prepared to return home the man with the"
C2,"Kinetic Art Rejoice — the well-nigh impossible has happened: London’s austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not thankfully by some huge-budget mega-hyped multi-media extravaganza but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century. As part of an ongoing project, it presents a single object from each of the five decades, for each of those decades. It then presents a sequence of images illustrating its content, accompanied by a brief narrative. A few years ago, I was surprised to find a single image from the fiftieth year – the first such exhibition in over three hundred years. It had been lost for centuries, but was finally rediscovered last year. Now it appears in this year’s show.
This time, the gallery is transformed into a kind of museum, where visitors are free to browse the objects. Many are surprisingly contemporary. A photograph taken in 1949 – which I cannot find now – shows a woman with her back to the camera but looking directly at the viewer, with a rather charmingly casual grin. And a photograph by Kaws in 1971 is set in a futuristic cityscape, with futuristic buildings looking back at us, their balconies set on either side of a wide central space. A few seconds later an image from 1950 shows a man pushing a baby stroller into a futuristic building, all of which are silhouetted against the sky. A few seconds after that, a child on a scooter pushes a shopping cart down the street, and a later image depicts a man in a wheelchair pushing another. The sequence of images finishes with a short sequence illustrating some of the text. I should have taken some notes, but I forgot. There is also a short film illustrating the work,"
C2,"Paul Simon Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked with their destinies. As the music changed so did Rock and Roll and this evolution still continues. 
  
 For the next generation of bands like Journey, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and U2, playing rock and roll became less about experimentation and more about commerce. Rock and Roll was their vehicle to the big time. 
  
 But that was only the beginning of Rock’s influence on popular music. His music was later turned into movies, TV shows and pop art. When Simon and Garfunkel sang We Wish You A Merry Christmas in 1967, they were turning their music into art. 
  
 The impact of the songs in movies has been huge as was evident with A Star Is Born, the remake of the classic movie, with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. 
  
 In the film, the two have an incredible duet and when Cooper sings a line about a girl who will never be his, Gaga sings her back. They are one of the most iconic duets in music history. 
  
 But for me, what is most amazing about this music from the 50s is that the Beatles songs were not the only ones made famous. Other famous Beatles songs were covered and made famous by others. Some songs have become standard and some have been played ad nauseum. Even the most basic songs that are in the pop culture sphere have been turned into pop songs as well. 
  
 For example, the most recent"
C2,"POETRY RECITALS At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. Poetry is written in times of crisis and often written in a state of distress; the poetry of despair and disillusionment was a consequence of our war. One of the tragedies of the great poem is that when a poet is alive we are not able to see his poetry with that keen perception of art that we would have had in the absence of war. We are forced to form our judgements from the limited and imprecise materials which, at best, the public press provides for our amusement. There has been some slight improvement in the condition of this public press since the outbreak of war. Poetry, to a greater or lesser extent, was published and heard on the radio last year. There are some good poems which appeared in the paper and there have been a few very good ones, but there remains a certain degree of superficiality on the part of all writers, a slowness of development, and an inability to take the reader to the depths of their emotions and experiences. There is little or no poetry of a serious nature in most of the papers. Our poets are often too busy and too proud and too self-righteous to write poems of beauty. We have become a nation of poets, yes, poets with no real talent. But there are those who are so gifted, so subtle, so lyrical and elusive, that their words can only be heard by those with the right ear, the ear of true poets. And their words may never be printed in the papers. Po"
C2,"CRYING Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness. In humans crying is usually not linked to pain. Rather, it is more likely to result from emotional exhaustion. Although crying may result from the emotion of joy, sadness, or fear, it is less likely to be spontaneous than is laughter. One could argue that our natural human tendency to cry arises from our desire to show other people our feelings. Indeed, children will often cry inconsolably when another child is in trouble or when the parent feels that their child is being treated unfairly. In other words, we cannot be too careful about protecting our children from emotional turmoil as they grow into adults. If they are unhappy, our own feelings will undoubtedly be upset too. The need to protect them from pain and rejection often explains why they cry. Because of this, parents are taught early on to cry with a child when they become upset. When children learn to cry, it reinforces an association between being sad and being sad. So they will continue to cry in future. However, our human tendency to cry might explain why we humans appear so unable to remain happy. A recent study has demonstrated that our behaviour is more likely to remain positive for longer if we are crying. Crying also triggers a feeling of guilt and depression, and this has been linked to increased feelings of happiness and low levels of sadness. This is one reason why we humans often seem more cheerful when we are happy, and our feelings of regret, anger and sadness. The reason behind this may be that we often think of ourselves as more"
C2,"Blogging: Confessing to the world Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into. This risk is heightened for those of us who are bloggers – as the site’s title suggests, this is a way to confess to the world (and your readers) where your whereabouts are. However, as it’s a confession, I’m thinking I should perhaps confess all – not just to the world but also to those readers. So here I am, in the blogosphere, admitting I’m at the house of a friend and his wife. That’s what I had for dinner, I think. The title I chose because you are unlikely to ever see anything like it. If I hadn’t been blogging, the title would have been a giveaway. And, even if I had chosen not to blog, ‘My Friend and His Wife’ (as my blog’s title is all-too-often used) would still have been an odd choice of words. For a start, I’m single. For another, my friend is married and his wife is, I think, not a very nice woman. Oh, and I’ve got a blog. If this is true, I think I prefer to be called ‘My Friend and His Wife, and Theirs Is Not a Nice House’. Anyway, back to confession. So, why am I revealing my whereabouts online? In the first place, I think it’s an attempt to help me keep fit. For instance, I"
C2,"Food There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting. Cooking can be a very rewarding experience for the person who does it and a challenge, both of which I am certain can be gained with the right ingredients. This book gives a comprehensive selection of the latest ingredients and methods for cooking, and is both a good guide to learning how to cook some of these new ideas, and a book that will be appreciated by people who are keen to cook. It is well worth considering.
The book is designed as a guide to many of the latest technologies available for cooking - from electric stoves to food dehydrators to wine coolers - but it also includes many techniques such as baking and roasting. It is also quite clear and detailed in describing the various products available and where to find them. In short, it is an excellent guidebook for anyone wanting to become a good cook. I am not a great cook, but I do like to cook, and this book is definitely on the way to my library.
This book covers every major food production process; how they work and how to best use them. It is a fascinating and informative book. Although the recipes are not particularly complicated (they contain an average of 1/3 fewer ingredients than modern cookery books), they are quite interesting and easy to understand. It is also quite entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and have a feeling I would like to know how everything works.
The recipes are presented as a list - but more like an order - with each ingredient separated by a number. For"
C2,"The Lure of the Kitchen When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is on the face of it an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long pressured menial - and badly paid. The hours are long and the meals are uninspiring. 
  
 Many of my mates opted for careers in other fields. Others opted to start their own business. But I decided to become a chef. It was a simple decision that I was convinced of. But as the years passed I began to realise that this could be a very hard life, even if the meals were tasty. 
  
 When I became a chef, my life was very different. My house in London was filled with chefs. I knew all of them. I knew their jobs, their families, their friends. It took a lot of time and a great deal of effort to form a real friendship with anyone. The most I could do was to pass around a plate of food. 
  
 The thing that always worried me most about the profession was the amount of stress that chefs endure. The demands of the job can take an enormous toll on your physical and mental health. 
  
 After I decided that I would love the job, my life took on an entirely new direction. It wasn't long before my wife and I made the move to London. I began to cook meals in restaurants on a regular basis. But I never dreamed of cooking my own meals. At my favourite restaurants, I would sit around a table and share my thoughts and ideas with others. It was my way of being in the kitchen all the time, sharing my knowledge.

C2,"TIM RICE I was ushered into the young man’s drawing room an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class. This wasn’t the way to the kitchen, it was the way to the dining room. “Welcome to my home.” His mother was a tall woman in a red dressing gown. She sat across from him in one of his armchairs. “I know you’re probably tired from all the traveling but if you could be patient with me for a while I have something I need to tell you in private.” “Not at all. You’ve earned my trust by staying away from the business so long. I’m the man who’s going to make a killing on these old family farms. And I’ve done it for the right reasons.” Who is the murderer?“What a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive.”

- Hamlet (3:5)

“The more, the merrier,” Tim’s father had observed.

TIM RICE’S MOM WAS IN A GOOD STATE, as far as she could tell, so she was glad when Tim offered his services to help her deal with her business. Even though Tim was the oldest and he didn’t have many friends yet, he had the good sense to make it a point to befriend the family’s new gardener. His name was Anthony, and the two of them spent an hour outside on the old farm"
C2,"Advertising on trial If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. So if you worked in an advertising agency in the 1990s and found yourself in a situation where the clients were looking for advertising agencies to help them make advertising decisions they were often looking for someone to sell to. They could not afford it, and they would only consider it if they had the money available to buy it. If they were also looking for advertising agencies to make them sell their company’s advertising, they also couldn’t afford it. This was the situation most agencies faced.
They had few clients, and with fewer clients came few opportunities. And of those few, very few were willing to pay for good work. So the agency was very slow in paying commission to its employees. But there were some small agencies where a quick turnaround from start to finish, with good quality work, was very profitable. These were the ones that were doing good work quickly. In these agencies the clients were usually willing to pay a reasonable wage and do good work in return. The problem with this way of working was that it was more difficult to build and maintain a strong client base of reliable advertisers, and these were difficult to build.
When the recession hit, the agencies also had to keep their staff costs down as much as possible, although it could be very difficult to do.
For advertisers looking to buy advertising, selling the agency was a tempting alternative. But there are also many ethical issues here. If an agency goes bust, the staff will have no place to go, and"
C2,"How to Write Poetry Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. This page gives pointers to make sure your poetry is of a high standard and to avoid becoming one of those annoying poets who keeps on posting his or her work over and over.

One important point of style for a poet is keeping a consistent cadence. The idea that you should repeat a rhyme or phrase over and over is a bit archaic for the new generation of writers. The best poetry does it in such a way that you would never guess at how it is being said. One of the best ways to do this is to just recite the poem word-for-word after reading it.
Poetry can sometimes be used to make a point. You can often tell something about the speaker from his or her poetry. If the speaker is trying to make a point about something, he or she would say something like: “… and I’ll just leave you with this…” (If you really can’t remember what a poem is about, read some books on poetry.) If the poem is used to show what the speaker is thinking, he or she would use a short phrase like: “You know, it’s funny how…” (“You know, it’s funny how…” is used to show how you would think it is funny if the speaker said the same thing without any punctuation.) This is one of the most important parts of the style that is commonly used in poetry. The poet�"
C2,"Online Literary Criticism For All Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun? From the outset the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice however a certain amount of technical know-how was required at least in the early years. Then the concept of the internet as an open library was born in the late 1990s. It became possible to put books online which previously would not have been available to the general public. However, if a user is willing to take some initial measures, he can have access to the literature of the past many centuries without the need of special equipment. In this context the first online literary criticism sites appeared in 2001: http://academia.stackexchange.com in January. Since then several millions of people have already used the online literary criticism on the Internet. It is also no longer necessary to have specialized knowledge to be able to participate in a discussion. This new online literary criticism system is known as “literary criticism for all”. Even if it involves a bit of technical know-how, it does not take up a lot of time. In fact most literary critics nowadays would not hesitate to accept requests to write reviews on a book they are studying at university. This online literary criticism system has a number of advantages. On the one hand, it encourages literary criticism more widely and at lower cost. On the other hand, the Internet gives people all over the world access to the literature of the past. The Internet also acts as a platform on which to share knowledge and ideas in the general literature. These two advantages are especially important in the post-modern world. The online literary criticism has made it possible for people to find a way to express themselves in a language they"
C2,"The two sisters kept Lily’s driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement) before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone. Finally they found an opportunity when Chen came to visit the allotments. They hid Lily in the hedge. He never came back. On hearing about this, his brothers joined in the fun, but it was too late; they had to flee with Lily. The foursome ran for the hills, and after a long search they found the little house with the chimney. They used all their energy to open the door, but could not move it and had to wait. They found the secret cellar, which was very small and smelled of stale bread and damp cloth. They took out the wine press and put wine and the old stone in the cellar, where it would never be seen again. It was only by pure luck that they discovered it. Chen arrived the following summer. After he had discovered Lily's whereabouts he was very glad to be back in his old house. His brothers made plans to settle down in the countryside and make a family. Chen asked his eldest sister, Su Ming, to help him choose a wife for him. She was not particularly enthusiastic. Su Ming said: 'This is my last year. I will spend it on a good voyage to China. My sister and I will be alone after I am married, because you always come here for holidays and we do not talk.' Chen decided to go anyway. His brothers did not want to go. They said: 'I will not go anywhere by myself'. But Chen went anyway. Chen made a few choices. He sent to"
C2,"We are Talking Big Boots here. Really BIGTIME Boots. I stood in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money no object. I wore the whole truly cowboy outfit and if you had the outfit you might be a cowboy. I felt like I was. And I could have been too if I had the cowboy boots and that attitude. I was in a new place and I was in the desert because I was in the desert in the middle of August and there was a lot of sand in the boots and the water on them. I was in the desert because I did not have a better choice for clothing. All the rest of my stuff was too hot or too wet or not cool enough to wear. The first thing that made me laugh was that I am in the desert in my designer-label boots. I then noticed that I wore no shirt and no pants or dress shoes. I looked around me in complete silence. I am not sure if it was the way I was dressed or the silentness or my just wanting to be a cowboy in all my cowboy ways, but I was so happy and relaxed that I did not even think about how I looked. I had no expectations of myself in the outfit other than that it would be comfortable and I was there. I only thought about the fact that I could wear that outfit and that I could be in the desert. And so I was. I looked around me and saw all the other people in the world looking around and seeing themselves in the outfit and then laughed. It was just a happy coincidence. This is a place I have been before and I know that it looks like that out there. And I think I really know that it does in this spot. And"
C2,"Love them fear them worship them human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports There's a bump bump bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird a bird of portent augury and divination. This is a bird of the south, a native of Britain and north Africa, an ancient and legendary bird. And if it says ""I feel something coming"" then I think we all feel something coming, a global, historic crisis of enormous proportions. Not just in the Middle East, where we are seeing a succession of genocides and wars. Not just in North America where thousands of Indians and others are marching in the streets in anger. It is happening all over the planet. ""This is the most violent and dangerous period in the history of our species,"" says one of our leading scientists. It is also a time of intense cultural, artistic and spiritual awakening. The word has just entered the vocabulary of humanity. It has entered our culture. It is not a coincidence. It is an expression of what's been going on for the last 200,000 years. The word is an invitation. How will you answer? Who knows? It may be nothing. Or it may be everything. For the past 2,000 years, as I have studied the origins of man, I've looked for the root cause of so many of our problems: our fear, our greed, our desire for more, even our hatred, our anger, our violence and our hatred of ourselves. For I think we all need to grow up and to become more mature and, if possible, more humble and more loveable, because we're all human beings. We are part of the natural world. We need it"
C2,"Joanna’s Lessons Joanna MacGregor has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist. So why has she added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano? Even a member of that mythical species the completely tone deaf could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. But, what is so magical about these books? They are not books about music. The main character of Joanna's Lessons is a baby learning how to sit, walk and talk. The author makes sure that each movement has a sound, a movement that is accompanied by the sound of a particular bell. These books help you teach your baby a little bit about the world around them, while also encouraging the child to learn to play the piano. Joanna's lessons is based on this simple concept and could be seen as a kind of 'learn to walk' baby book for music lovers. The lessons are given to the baby in intervals. These intervals are the time between the bell sounds that remind us that music, as we know it, is always played. 
  
 The book is also a great companion for parents, teaching them to appreciate music when they were themselves unaware of it, while also encouraging them to get in the habit of learning from a young age. 
  
 The book is perfect for those parents who want to introduce a child to classical music but do not want to give the child classical lessons. While at the same time they still want the child to learn to sit and play the piano. 
  
 It also has a great educational value as it teaches young children to recognise different sounds. There are some children who may struggle to recognise some of the sounds in the book but the way the book is designed, they will come to understand these sounds"
C2,"Every Picture Tells a Story Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer but also illuminating. Working on a script I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point.

For the story we wanted to tell, it didn't matter that much whether the words ""craning its head"" or ""giggling"" appeared in a scene, so long as the reader understood what the characters were doing.
For the dialogue, the character is telling a story and so the words tell a story in the form of a sentence. Words become sentences when read aloud, and this is where I feel I'm most comfortable. I wrote a screenplay of my novel and it works best when read aloud. If I'm reading the screenplay and a scene or line isn't clear, I can rephrase the dialogue to make it explicit. Sometimes the same is true of the writing itself, too. The prose is the essence of a novel, and so I'm naturally most comfortable with that form.
One of the things I liked about writing the screenplay was trying to be the director. With the novel, I would have found that hard to do, since I'm not a natural director. The screenplay I wrote was an attempt to see if that could be done.

In this task, you are given a text of many books, from which you have to pick the most representative one to write a paragraph about it. The paragraph should be about one single idea or theme of the book, and should not repeat itself or be too long or too complex. The topic should not be inconsistent with the summary you created for this task.The most representative book in my"
C2,"The Heat is On We’ve all heard of global warming but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives? Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. It is likely that the number of heat-related deaths will increase. In a warmer world, water resources will be more easily evaporated, causing flooding and drought. The availability of fresh drinking water is likely to be significantly affected. The number of heat-related illnesses and deaths is likely to increase. In a warmer world, the risk of desertification is likely to increase significantly and the frequency and severity of droughts is likely to increase. Desertification is the loss of vegetation and soil that can provide for the growing of crops. It is the loss of fertile land and is a major factor in migration, social instability, food and water crisis and wars. A warmer world will also mean more rainfall than the present world. There is a high likelihood that extreme rainfall events will occur more frequently. This will lead to floods, water wars and food crises. It will also lead to soil erosion and degradation. Global warming is set to have a serious negative impact on agricultural production in the future. There is high likelihood that the number of people who depend on agriculture will increase significantly. There are likely to be food riots in the world, as a result of increased food prices. There is high likelihood that the number of people in poverty, particularly in countries such as Africa, is likely to increase significantly. Global warming has also been linked to a decline in crop yields. It has been found that the number of crop-friendly trees in the world is much lower than in the past. As a result, the"
C2,"Maps The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth’s surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. In a general sense, they serve as a set of graphical coordinates by which an observer can locate the position of another object on a coordinate system. In this article, we consider two kinds of maps — surface maps and contour maps. In surface maps, the features appear on the map as lines on the surface of the Earth, and the lines represent the positions of the points on the map. The contour maps appear on the map with a contour which traces the contours of points and features on the surface of the Earth. The contour map expresses an observer’s position on the surface in coordinates which are different from coordinates in the surface of the Earth. This kind of map is used by astronauts to locate objects on the surface and find their positions. The surface maps in space are created by printing a special material, called “polychromatic ink,” on paper in a shape which will reflect light as a sphere will. The polychromatic ink reflects light from specific angles, and is thus a surface map. The surface of Earth is a sphere, so the surface map reflects light from all angles, which reflects the positions of all points on the Earth at different angles. The surface of the Earth reflects the light from the surface map to the center of the sphere, so the position of the surface map on the sphere is the same as the positions of the points on the Earth at all other angles. The position of the surface map at any angle above the central axis"
C2,"HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. He was the leader of the 1911 Antarctic expedition. He used the skills and experience he had to reach the Antarctic, where they went to find a way to avoid becoming trapped in ice for three years. That’s a huge distance and it takes a lot of skill, but his ship, Endurance, was a formidable vessel. His leadership helped his team reach safety. It was a big, mighty ship made of iron. He was famous afterwards and everyone was interested to know what he did next. He went back to Europe to work for the Royal Navy. In 1912 he became the director of South Georgia and was responsible for keeping the Falklands safe and welcoming ships and people back to South Georgia. That was a very important job and I wonder if we all can relate to the work that Sir Ernest did. He had a very impressive, big role to play in keeping the world safe. He knew everything and was a people person. He was always ready with a smile and a joke to make everyone feel good. He didn’t have any special skills, but he worked hard for others and people liked that. When he retired, he enjoyed gardening and reading, particularly the history of the Titanic, and spending time with his wife. He died in South Georgia in 1939. It’s a lovely place and, if I’m honest, I’d be tempted to go there too. He was a lovely man. I hope it wasn’t too cold. There"
C2,"Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain. In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. This paper offers an assessment of the technology developed and the impact it has had on our music production output in Britain. A key finding is that the pace of technology is increasing. As a result music produced in Britain has not kept pace. It is noted that the majority of recorded music in the UK was produced in the 1950s but by the mid-1970s this was not the case. There is an urgent need to address this problem. The impact of technology on our music has also had an effect on public culture. Radio has become a primary way of listening to music with over 98% of British people listening to the radio in the home, a figure that has grown steadily over recent years. The impact of technology on music production and on our public culture is discussed with examples drawn from the music industry, the BBC, the music media and the culture industry in the context of the last 20 years. As well as assessing the impact it has had on our public culture, the paper considers the development of technological solutions for addressing the problem. It concludes that it is imperative that new technologies be developed to help overcome this technological challenge.

C2,"Holiday reading Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are of course intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. That may explain why we relate so strongly to The Lord of the Rings. Reading is like travel: we are transported to a place where we belong, and this is one of the great pleasures of reading. But more importantly, reading can provide us with a new understanding of life’s difficulties and triumphs, helping us to see the world through a different point of view. Our ability to grasp these two pleasures - pleasure and understanding - depends to some extent on our ability to read. And as children and teenagers, we may be in the best position to help ourselves improve our ability to read. As with anything else in life, to improve our ability to read is also a way of learning more about yourself. That can help us to understand ourselves as individuals and as a society. In the next article, we will explore this idea. We will look at the importance of reading to children and teenagers, with a particular focus on teenagers. Our ideas about reading are constantly changing. We need to keep pace with the latest developments in this field. The article will look at current developments in this field, including some of the latest advances in pedagogy, methods and the impact of technology on this area of learning. Finally, we will look at some of the latest approaches to improving reading comprehension. A major problem is that many young people do not engage fully with books. They see books only as a source of entertainment. However, for many people, books are also a way of communicating. Books may"
C2,"Photography When a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills personal views and experience together with a set of social and cultural norms. A picture has three basic components that combine to form an image in the mind’s eye.

The photographer has a vision, which is the basic idea of what he or she intends to present to the world. Vision can be expressed through ideas and imagery, or a visual representation of those ideas.

The photographer has the opportunity to realize that vision and to share it with others.

Photography can have positive or negative impact on society. However, it can also serve as a force for social change. The more people see, the more they can learn about themselves, their world, and how to live. How to choose between a good photograph and an embarrassing photograph?

Photography has a huge potential to help people in their everyday lives. One example of a positive impact would be improving understanding and appreciation of nature. On the other hand, photographers are faced with a large range of problems and situations, which can be very distressing and disturbing for them and can lead to a lot of difficulties in terms of the composition and overall artistic quality of their photographs. It is difficult for a professional photographer to find a good balance between the demands on their time and their psychological state. In addition, the pressures are constantly increasing because of the demands made on photographers by a demanding business environment and a consumer base increasingly demanding the best. On the other hand, photographers’ business models rely heavily on the volume of work they receive, and their livelihood is linked to that of their clients"
C2,"Family Business ‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father with my brother Maurice in tow had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls’ school I attended. It was the last time that I would be going there. We did have a wonderful time. It was the last year before we moved away from that place. We spent the rest of the journey in a jovial mood, my father was telling stories of his adventures. It seemed like an age ago. I would love to relive that moment now as it was truly one of the best days in my childhood. My dad was a talented carpenter. There was a reason we called him “The Little Shop ‘o Shops.’ He was small, but fast, hardworking and very determined. He was always on time and punctual, but never rushed, even when under pressure. But his most important trait was that he loved doing things for others. He had just retired and wanted to enjoy life. I have always been inspired by my father. He was a good man, who wanted to leave a legacy behind. So he started out small with a few friends and worked his way into a family business which is today called ‘Crowley Group.’ A lot of our family still works for him. Dad was a talented artist and very good at wood turning. The shop was decorated with a variety of paintings, engravings, etchings, wood turning tools and so on. Dad would take us all round the shop and show us his favourite pieces. My brother Maurice and I loved showing him our toys. We would run around the store trying to"
C2,"Vancouver In the last ten years or so hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver in western Canada. To relax in the evening residents stroll down the city streets and if you join them you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. This is because Vancouver is the English speaking Capital of Canada. There is a vibrant city life for the residents of Vancouver, however it is not without its problems. With a population over one million people, Vancouver's transport system is the largest in Canada and therefore it is difficult to find parking places for vehicles in Vancouver. This is one of the reasons why, when you want to get around in Vancouver, you are most likely to use a car instead of public transport. Vancouver is an exciting city but it can also be a crowded one. It is therefore important to know the different options you have when planning your visit to Vancouver. It's also important to know how to use these different options in a safe and clean way so you do not get yourself into trouble. This article will help you make the most of the city you are visiting, even when you have limited time to do it! Vancouver is a city in British Columbia, Canada and the capital of the province of British Columbia. It is located on the Strait of Georgia, approximately 100 km (62 mi) north of the Strait of Georgia (also known as the South Sound), between Vancouver Island and southern Fraser Valley of British Columbia. The city includes the Vancouver International Airport and is home to Canada's second-largest city and fifth largest metropolitan area. The city is governed by a municipal government, which is composed of the City Council and the Board of Trade. The mayor of the city is named Peter Port. Vancouver has a population of approximately 650,"
C2,"MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house I learned that opera is in fact only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That’s as it should be of course. But the opera house has no place in a good theatre, a great theatre is one which nurtures the arts and the art form. A theatre with an opera house is one which is far from being great. The more I see of the contemporary art world the more I am aware of the fact that opera is, by far, the most important artistic form of the twenty-first century. It is still, for me, as important as painting and architecture. And as I look for new ways to get people excited about opera I am increasingly coming to believe that the best way is to give them a compelling and engaging theatre to do so. That is the problem I have with theatre critics that write about theatre. It is not that their assessments are wrong. On the contrary, there is a vast amount of great work by a whole generation of contemporary playwrights that is still awaiting a place at a top theatre like the Royal Shakespeare Company. Rather their evaluations are not objective, but based on the perception of their readership. Or rather, they are not objective at all. Many are simply opinion based, as is the case with theatre critics as a whole. Their job is largely to write for those on the inside of theatre and to report what they think. That job requires them to be objective of a sort. Otherwise they wouldn’t be journalists. But that objective nature is not really relevant. They write based on perceptions, and perceptions are the subject of the very review which they write."
C2,"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology 'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. Broadcast, a radio transmission medium was made possible by the telegraph which connected two farms in order to send messages between them by land and by water. At the same time the telegraph became public property. As soon as a telegraph was erected in a city the whole countryside was covered by it in a matter of minutes. As soon as the telegraph was invented, a network of wires stretched across every town, village and hilltop. A line was established from the station in the city to the station at the foot of the hill, and a line from the station at the foot of the hill to the station at the top of the hill, thus all of a sudden all the people in the villages and the towns had access to telegraph. With the invention of the telegraph it did not take long for the telegraph to spread like a contagious disease from house to house, to take over the whole community. People were not surprised by this. The very idea of this spreading of a technology was considered in this context by the early modern thinkers. This was how the word broadcast came into the English language from Dutch broadcasting. BROADCASTING and it also means spreading seeds widely in all directions, including in the smallest of things. If only the telegraph had not spread so quickly and so wide. The expression broadcast comes from a French expression which means sowing in the widest of circles, and which also occurs from Dutch broadcasting. Broadcast in this context means spreading seeds broadly in all directions"

C2,"Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941 despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst its alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. Now, at the behest of Charles Foster Kane, the playwright he loved (his mother is a major player in the play and will make her on-screen appearance shortly) the silent movie of the same name will be made into a dramatic film. But, instead of being presented by the Academy or Hollywood or both, the film will be presented, not by the Academy or Hollywood, but by a private screening club in New York City. Because of this, the play, which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1927, is being set to be produced as a film by a company called IFC, Inc. The company was named for what seems to be the name of a New York street corner. What’s IFC stand for? In order to find out, IFC has enlisted the help of a number of the industry’s most celebrated experts in the art of TV, which, as it turns out, is a big field. IFC, Inc. and their clients have gathered at Columbia University in New York City to talk about the project. This is what they’ve come for. There is a question of financing for the movie, which would cost far more than a typical silent movie, but IFC has the backing of the John F. Kennedy Foundation. One of the IFC’s partners is Jonathan Glickman, who is perhaps best known for founding YouTube, the video sharing service that has become an international phenomenon. He is the grandson of"
C2,"England’s breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. The arrival of breakfast in England was partly a response to the need to improve the quality of the diet of farmers. As a result, some historians believe that the first mention of the word breakfast is to be found in medieval literature as early as 1399. In the 12th century, the English began to treat the morning meal as an important part of their daily diet with many English men writing books about how to cook a healthy breakfast. The success of the English Breakfast in England in the 12th century made it one of the most popular dishes of the period and a staple for English breakfast table for centuries. However, although the food was a massive success it did not go down well with the other residents of the country and it was made illegal in some areas. The first known recorded mention of breakfast in English literature is in 1399 when William de Beaumont of Ely recorded a letter from a man named Peter and his wife Elizabeth in which Peter wrote about the delicious breakfast that he had had that morning. Thereafter, many more examples of the breakfast meal were recorded, including the ones penned by Sir Edward Coke and other English writers, although in modern terms breakfast has become so widely understood that in many places the word breakfast has replaced the name of the meal. Today, the word breakfast has become a generic term for any meal that takes place at least half an hour before the start of the day meal. English Breakfast This story begins in 1133 with the death of the first Anglo-Saxon king"
