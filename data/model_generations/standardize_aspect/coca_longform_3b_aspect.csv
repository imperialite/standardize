     A river of flames ran down the middle of the street, burning cars and people. It had been raining for a while, so the streets were covered with thick mud. All of a sudden, the rain stopped, and the sun came out. The fire moved from the middle of the street to the other side, and then the rain came back again. After that, the sun stayed out, so the mud disappeared again, and people woke up the next morning to a beautiful day.  The story ends on this beautiful day.Mr. Anderson had been on holiday for the last few weeks, and on his return he noticed that his house had become rather messy. All of the furniture was turned upside down, the bed was pushed to the wall and Mr. Anderson had lost all of his valuable books. The police were informed, and it seemed that it was a case of robbery, as all of the valuable stuff had been stolen. But no-one was found who had done it. The house was cleaned up and Mr. Anderson found that everything was in order again. He was grateful that no-one had broken into his house. And the next day, he saw that the river of fire was back again, even though he hadn't seen any fire earlier in the year.  It was the same as it had been last year. But that was not the only thing that had been the same: the clothes were all different, and they had no names on them. Mr. Anderson"

     Two people are sitting at a caf√©, drinking coffee and eating pancakes. The first guy orders a cappuccino, but the waitress mistakes it for a cappuccino and gives him a latte. To prove it to the waitress, he orders another cappuccino and asks the waitress for a latte as well. Then the waitress takes out the right cappuccino and gives him the wrong one. The second guy, watching this, laughs and says: ""I can't believe that!"" The first guy looks sad and says, ""We're in trouble now!"" To which the other guy replies: ""No, no, no, I just made a mistake. Don't worry about it!"" They both laugh and take the cappuccino/latte mix and put it back. Then, with a sip of their coffee, they take another bite of their pancakes and sip their coffee, and continue laughing together.

    Now, the first guy asks: ""So what were you doing?"" The other guy says: ""I was eating pancakes.""

    The first guy responds: ""Pancakes have a mystery, too. They're hard to eat, because they're long and have lots of short words in them. But, they also have a short, easy to read sentence in the middle. Pancakes have a story you can figure out just by reading the word 'pancakes'. But, I'm sure there is another way"

     Sylvia and her boyfriend visited the forest near their house to look for a new tree house. Since they could not find one, Sylvia looked for an old one they used to visit as a child. One day she noticed that the tree that the tree house was built on was dying, and she was afraid that the tree would be cut down. As she was sitting in the tree house, she saw the big bird fly towards her. She was afraid it would destroy the tree and thus they would die. The bird landed in the tree, and a loud cry was heard. The bird asked Sylvia why she made it angry, and she admitted she was afraid it would harm the tree. The bird asked again why she was afraid, and she answered because she was wrong. The bird asked her again why she was wrong and told her that the tree was not alive. The bird asked her a third time if the tree was dead, to which she replied yes. The bird told her she was correct about the tree being dead, but she was wrong about who was responsible for it. The bird told her that she was wrong because she was afraid of the bird. The bird then left and asked for her forgiveness. She replied she had been wrong about all three things. She then asked if she could have a snack and told her she could eat one slice of fruit.

My friend told me that his wife had been attacked by dogs in their dream.  I was shocked to hear it.  In my dream when I saw my friend with his wife, I went away from the dream and slept again.One night, a man had a dream.  He was standing at the edge of a pond, gazing into the water.   Looking over the water, he could see a large number of animals, all floating around in the water.  He saw a dog come up to him, and the man petted it gently on the top of its head.  He saw another dog, about the size of a human, trotting along beside the first dog.  Another large dog was also there, with what looked like a human head on its back.  Finally, a man could see a large black pig floating on the surface of the water.   The man stroked the pig's back gently, smiling at the pig.   Finally, he dreamed that he came to life again, and was able to walk around.  When he looked around, he could see that there were no animals around.  Then he woke up.

      They had seen lots of different animals. They had run with elephants and felt their strength. They had seen crocodiles and watched them eating fish. They had walked for days over the desert. They had lived in the ocean and walked across the sand with sharks in the sea. They had slept under the stars and listened to the sea birds singing. Then it was time to see the wonder of the world, the Taj Mahal. They were amazed that the building has stood for so long. They wanted to see the white tiger and had heard that it was a very special animal. They left to go see the tiger in the forest and it was amazing to watch the tiger come out of the den.

However, she said she would marry him anyway and agreed to adopt a child. When the couple was on the return trip, the woman suddenly felt severe pains in her abdomen. She started to complain of pains but her husband said she was not in pain at all. Suddenly she got out of the car and fell to the ground, crying in pain. The man told her to lie down so she could get a better view of the pain she was feeling. She laid down on the ground and her husband ran back to the car.

     Aquatic Life I have been on the river ever since. In fact, you could say I was born there. Because, to be honest, there is nothing more enchanting than a flowing river.  You can go swimming, canoeing, rafting, and just sit and be at one with the nature and all of the little creatures that populate it.  So, what can you do when you are there?  I am not sure, but I do know that one of the best ways to have a good time is to swim! You should never swim in the ocean, of course, because that is crazy, but there is a river that is perfect for swimming in. The river has just enough current that it is not too dangerous, but enough that it will keep you out of trouble. For me, there is only one thing better than swimming in that river and that is fishing! I never get tired of fishing. I can be in the midst of the most amazing lake and be fishing before I realize it. But, it is different when you are out on a river that is flowing. There is something more wonderful about a river than a lake or a bay. The thing about a river is that it is always flowing and it never ever stops. That is a wonderful thing about the river. The other thing I love about it is that there is always a million fish waiting to bite. It is a pretty exciting thing to have that many fish around to chase. This is"

     This myth is a myth.
No good myths come from mythology. There is too much to know about myths to tell them, and most of what is known is wrong. Myth is only a word for an invented story, not for an unmade one.
Mythology is a real science, based on observation. It is based on a theory of how people learn, based on what they actually know. This theory was based on observations about what they know, and it is still true today. There is a lot we don‚Äôt know about mythology. We don‚Äôt know what makes it effective, or why people believe it. We don‚Äôt know why people like to read about it. We don‚Äôt know what makes myths effective. What we do know is that myths will not work for you, and that if you do have a myth, then it is not a myth. If you follow the myth you will find that it doesn‚Äôt work.
This means you can create a myth of your own. You can create a story that is based on something real, even if the something is made up. You can use something real that people have believed in. You can make up something real that people believe in. But you can‚Äôt use the myth of something real that people have not.

     The Secret of the Spell Spell 1

All the spells were written by children. 

It seems the witch was the only one who knew their secret. She took the spells for herself. 

The witch gave each spell to a different monster or animal.

Rabid rats, greedy foxes, mean mice and ugly frogs all had a spell that was theirs.

After that, the witch took all the spells for herself.

The children lived in fear of the witch's cruelty. 

The children knew that the spells were dangerous. They didn't have a clue. Who would be next in her list? 

All the children did was cry. They couldn't go to the school because of the witch's spells. They couldn't go to their houses because she had their spells.

The witch's power made them angry. There was no hope. There was no escape. What can they do? They couldn't give up and wait for death. That would be the end of them all. They had to die, but not die. They had to be reincarnated. They had to be reborn. 

The children would have to learn to cope with her cruelty. They had to face the truth. The truth was that the witch had the power. 

In the darkness the children would sleep. At night, the witch would take the spells.

All the children would wake up. There was"

     The museum is currently displaying the remains of the Titanic, one of the most famous vessels in the world.  The boat had two decks: the upper deck and the lower deck.  The upper deck was occupied by the passengers, while the lower deck was used only for cargo.  The Titanic was the first and largest passenger liner.  She was traveling between Liverpool and New York City when she caught fire and hit an iceberg on April 15, 1912.  After hitting the iceberg, the Titanic lost her stability and started to sink to the ocean.  Her passengers and crew died one by one.  Some people managed to escape and survived by swimming in the lifeboats.  
As the passengers died one by one, the upper deck became full.  People were forced to move to the lower deck, in which cargo was stored.  The lower deck became overcrowded as well.  The passengers became desperate and decided to abandon the ship by swimming into the open water.  But because of the freezing water and strong currents, most of them died.  This was the worst tragedy that the world had ever experienced.  The survivors then continued their journey to America.  They had to travel for another 100 days before they reached New York.  The whole thing took about a year to complete.  On the way, some of them survived by eating the raw fish that floated on the surface.  
  
 In the museum, you can read about this tragic event."

           The beast lived in the forest, a creature of great power. 
               He lived in a time before humans, long ago. 
                He lived and walked in the ancient time, for he is one with the tree, the tree is one with the beast. 
                 The beast lived in a land where he could roam, away from his mate, but he would see her, even if she went to another tree, a sign that their bond was stronger than the forest they call home. 
                  The beast knew his time was running out. For he had become the prey of the hunters, for he was but one of many beasts caught in the hunt. 
                   The hunters would return, every year, to the place where the beast lay. All the beasts would try to escape the hunters. But every year one beast would be the last, for the hunters would come. But that beast would be lucky for they would hunt just for the beast, and leave the others alone.

Jack Sparrow was the ship's skipper. 
There were four pirates: 
Johnny Depp, Kate Moss, Johnny Galecki, and Seth Rogen. 
They were all trying to steal a giant gold heart from another ship. 
Their plan was to hide it in a tree and then use it as a ship's compass. 

Their search was tough because pirates are not as fast as they should be. 
The rain was making it harder to see anything and pirates could easily get lost. 

Suddenly, Johnny Galecki heard a rumble in the sky. 
Everyone hid under a rock and watched in horror as a giant cannon shot through the sky. 
It blew up part of the ship and turned it into a giant heart. 
The cannonball's path went straight to Johnny Depp and Kate Moss' ship. 

It was so big that it nearly hit Johnny Depp's eye. 
It was so powerful that it turned the ship into a giant heart. 
The rain slowed down and suddenly Johnny Depp was in a pirate outfit. 
He opened the giant heart and discovered a giant map with a red dot on it. 
It pointed to a pirate ship with gold horns.

His parents always try to stop him from doing magic, and he has a habit of trying it on his friends. When his grandmother comes to stay, things get more and more complicated. Grandmother is very kind and patient and does not wish to interfere with David's magic tricks. But unfortunately, he manages to trick an old woman named Mrs. Puddifoot. Mrs. Puddifoot accidentally falls asleep in the shop. David goes and tries to wake her up. However, she had fallen into a deep sleep and when she finally wakes up, she starts speaking nonsense. David is happy that she is awake. She seems to be fine now. Mrs. Puddifoot starts telling David the story of her adventures during the day. She is still trying to remember what happened to her when she was sleeping. David takes her to the castle, where the sorcerer and his daughter are sleeping. He tries to steal a magic book, but it is guarded by the dragon, that does not want him to get it. David tries to trick it, but it catches him and he is injured. While David was unconscious, the dragon attacked the sorcerer, who had fallen asleep with a very large stomach pain. The sorcerer and his daughter had to hide at the bottom of the staircase, where the dragon tried to bite them."

     Fortresses 
    The village was peaceful but for the fortress. It was tall and strong as a lion, and was made entirely of wood. The castle could stand against a hundred attackers and was only captured by the enemy after a week of fighting. It was a beautiful piece of architecture. 
    ‚ÄòBut if we had it,‚Äô thought the king, ‚Äòthere wouldn‚Äôt be anyone to invade us.‚Äô The fortress had a castle, a dungeon and a moat. The dungeon was an enormous room that could hold a hundred prisoners without ever getting full. The castle was made of wood, so it could protect the fortress from the outside while the wood-cutters worked inside. And the moat was wide enough to swim in. It was a terrible place for people to live, but it was a great place to hide from the attackers. They could hide inside and fight from there. And there was always the risk that they might escape and fight even more defenders. 
    The king and all his men wanted a fortress. But a fortress was not easy to build. It had to be strong enough to defend against an attack, but also large enough that it would protect other villages and towns. It had to be safe. And of course, it had to be beautiful. 
    It was a hard task, for it is much more difficult to build a fortress than it is to build a"

I saw a galaxy in space
the shape is almost like a tree
looks like a blue and green fruit.

It was bigger than a house
It was bigger than a horse
It was bigger than the moon.

When i was a kid my brother
told me this is a galaxy
it looks like the apple.

I think this is how it should look.
And the story will go like this.
The sky will be blue and there will be green.
And there will be an apple there
and people will eat it.
And after that they will go to the moon.
So it was good to know that there are galaxies out there. 
You can put that in your resume.

     I am a survivor of a violent school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. I was there at the time when the shooting happened. The school was well lit and there were many adults with firearms, which enabled a good response. 
  
  
  
  
  

The shooter, Adam Lanza, was a quiet and very intelligent young man who seemed to have no reason for his actions. He entered the school and began killing children and adults with an AR15-type rifle, all of which were legally owned by his mother. She had not notified the police or done anything to alert them to her intention. He killed twenty five children and six adults, plus he killed himself after firing the rifle into the school and injuring himself in the process.

Although it is an interesting book to read, it is written in such a way that it is hard to read.

This sentence is hard to figure out because the reader has to figure out what the author's feelings are about the club.

     On this day, in 1033 A.D., Rome was founded by a man named Romulus. Rome, the city of ancient Rome, flourished until the fourth century, when the city was sacked and destroyed by the Vandals. After that, it wasn't until 1476, that the city again enjoyed peace and prosperity, only to be destroyed for the fourth time in the twentieth century, by Mussolini's fascist regime. Today, the ruins of ancient Rome still stand on the shores of the Tiber River, as a symbol of the ruins of human freedom in Italy. Rome has always been a symbol of freedom for the rest of the world as well, a symbol of hope. Rome was a city, founded by a group of brave young boys who had a dream, a dream for the world. They had to fight for that dream until they finally achieved it. It's now their legacy to the world. If you would like to travel to Rome to see the ruins, you can get there easily by using an airline from somewhere like Seattle, or Atlanta. If you would like to travel by train to Rome, you can go from the city of Venice to Milan. You can also go from Venice, to Rome by bus, which is a more efficient way to travel than by train.

     Detective stories and mysteries are popular. Readers are more likely to be able to follow a complicated story if they are familiar with police work or criminal law.
One popular detective story is ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" by Arthur Conan Doyle. This is a complex story, but it is well-written.
""The Adventure of the Red Circle"" by John W. Gardner has more simple structure, but still contains interesting plots. The story involves many complex situations. This story is not recommended for younger readers because of its adult themes and content.
The famous detective stories ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The Big Sleep"" are very popular among children. Children can easily follow these complicated and clever stories even if they are less familiar with the legal issues of law enforcement.
The most complicated of all detective stories is ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J.D. Salinger. The story centers around the experiences of the main character Holden Caulfield. The plot is complex and it involves many interesting legal issues.
In summary, it is harder to follow a complicated story, such as the one found in ""The Catcher in the Rye"", than it is to follow a simple one, such as the one found in ""The Maltese Falcon."" In addition, detective stories involving illegal activities are usually more complicated than those without illegal activity.Detective stories are stories that involve a police investigation.

     The children are not criminals. The crime is that the teacher does not ask any questions about this case. I understand that the teacher wants to help the children with their english but is it not possible for the teacher to put the students on hold for a while and find a reasonable explanation for not asking the question?
In my language classes we always have to go through the cases to make sure our speaking skills are good enough. This might be a small issue for this class, but the teacher should check if the students can manage with the grammar rules as well as the other concepts. At least the children were asked about why the teacher had not asked the question. Perhaps in future they will. And if not, it might be an opportunity for the teacher to have a talk about grammar and other aspects of english.
But, in general I am a huge fan of the common core standards, I think they will help students to learn English easier. As an example, in my language classes we have to learn verbs according to the rules and I think it helped me a lot in other courses. For a more complex language like English there should be more things to think about. It makes more sense to me. I can not say it is the best system because it does not provide enough options, but, on the other hand, it does not exclude anyone from an education. I hope this makes sense.In this story, criminals are: the child and the teacher.
The child feels powerless."

     ""Ghosts"" was chosen for our topic word this week. This topic word is ""ghosts"". The story was short and to the point. It was interesting to find that ghost stories are very common in literature. It made me wonder, what type of ghost stories were the most popular? For example, the story told how this little boy became afraid of the sound of his parents' bed covers rustling. Or how this man could hear the noises of a man and a dog who were dead in the room. Or how the little boy who had never seen a ghost before in his life saw one in his room, even though there was nobody in the room with him! I would like to know if there is a scientific name for this type of ghost. Maybe there is a special type of ghost! It would be nice to know the name of the most famous ghost! I wonder where the ghost in the story comes from. Maybe he's the ghost of his deceased brother? Or maybe he's the ghost of his deceased cousin who was killed by a train? Or maybe it's a combination of his cousins ghost and the ghost of the train? The story also told how a father who was a bit worried about his daughter's ability to detect the sound of a ghost came home to hear the sound of a ghost in her room. He checked out the window and discovered that he was wrong. The ghost was standing in front of him, talking. But he was able to go to bed at"

     We can get a little bored of vampires. They are popular characters in movies and the like. There are many good movies but there isn't that many good books that deal with them and there is a lot of them out there. I have never read a good vampire novel (of course, I have read a few) but in some of the great movies, the vampires are often quite intelligent and can become really fascinating in some situations. I would recommend looking up some of those great movies that deal with vampires to see if you think they are worth reading. I know that in some of the Harry Potter movies, the vampire Dobby is pretty awesome. So that would be the only vampire I would read. Good luck!Here is a story about vampires, written by a five-year-old girl.My name's Amy. My mommy says I'm going to be a writer when I grow up. So she's giving me a book about vampires. It's about them being like me, except more special and beautiful and stuff. I know that a lot of vampires hate being in sunlight, like me, so they get really sad. They want to go back into the dark like me. But my mommy doesn't know about all that, because she doesn't know everything about me. 
The book is called 'How To Hide From the Sun'. My mommy says that's just a silly name for the book. But that's what it's called. Even though"

     The Zombie Apocalypse 

One Friday afternoon, a friend of mine in high school, named Paul, came to me to tell me of the latest and greatest invention that he had come up with. 
""I thought this would be fun,"" Paul told me.  ""You know, everyone is terrified of zombies right now. Let's make them funny again!""


Paul and his buddy James had concocted the perfect plan to get people to laugh about zombies.  They decided to go into a city's parking lot and place large, dead, and rotting carcasses of dead animals in every single parking spot.


""When zombies find them,"" Paul explained, ""they will think that the animals are still alive and are trying to protect them. And they'll just burst into uncontrollable laughter at zombies with their legs hanging out of their pants!""


The two of them laughed at the idea for a couple of days, but then they took a couple of days off work to do it. 
 
When they went back to work on Monday morning, the city parking lots were filled with dead animals. Each of the cars was filled to the brim. The dead animals were everywhere. 
 
But, no zombies! 
 
""I told you that it would work!"" James exclaimed. ""And we did! We actually created a zombie epidemic in our town!""

     The story began with the angels being sent from heaven to Earth by their creator in order to warn people about the fall of man and the resulting consequences. The angels had never met humans in the flesh before and they weren't sure how humans would react to seeing them. The three human angels decided to go to the middle of the Earth where it was warmest. They each took a piece of earth in their hands and threw it. Adam, Eve, and their two sons looked at the pieces of earth and were very confused because they all were the same size and the color of clay. Adam and Eve were a little worried, while the other angels were very excited to see humans. They looked for humans for a long time but they didn't see any. The angels couldn't help but wonder if humans would ever wake up and find them. They did eventually find humans in the evening in the middle of the Earth, and the humans weren't very happy that they had woken them up. They accused the angels of being liars because they had warned them about the fall of man, but they were angry that the angels didn't warn them about where the angels would be. They wanted to go back to bed. Adam and Eve had just a few questions for the angels but the angels weren't willing to answer any of their questions because they were concerned that humans would judge them and think that they were liars just like the humans had judged them. The angels finally agreed to answer some questions if the"

     A demon has made himself at home in a very important person.
First he eats a little bit of his person's heart. Then, from the person's shoulder blade he has pulled out a thorn. The demon has been sitting in the person's seat for the past week. The demon thinks the thorn looks cool and he would like to wear it. The person is a great guy. He does a lot of charity for the poor. He has helped a lot of people. However, his heart is weak. The person has lost a lot of blood and he might have a heart attack. The demon has made a hole in the person's heart.
Now the demon has a thorn. A thorn that is warm and soft. The demon has also managed to find a worm in the person's arm. This worm is cold and disgusting. The demon is quite sure that the worm will make the person sick. The person is going to get really sick very soon. He has eaten too much and drunk too much. Now the person has a lump in his throat. The person has started to cough. He can't get enough air. He has a high fever. The person also has a sore back and a painful sore stomach. The demon is sure that the person is dying. When the person dies the demon will disappear. The demon will also disappear with the worm, which he is sure will crawl out of the person's skin. There is just one thing left in the person's body."

     Superheroes! 
  
 That's an exciting idea, the superheroes! 
  
 They could be heroes, though not quite as I thought they would be. 
  
 They couldn't just be normal people, fighting for the sake of fighting. That's for children to do.
  
 No, they were different. The kind of superheroes I was thinking of didn't just fight because they felt like it. They fought because they knew the right thing to do, because they had a sense of right and wrong. They were always on the right side. They were never in the wrong. They knew what they had to do.
  
 The superheroes had clear morals, but that was just the start. They didn't just follow those morals because they were good, they also knew how to act on those morals. They were not just good people with a good nature, they were also good people with the right behaviour. They knew how to think and act like that.
  
 That's what I liked about superheroes. They were different, but not just different. They had their own way of being heroes. A lot of people were ordinary, but there was always someone more extraordinary.
  
 That's why I like superheroes, they have their own way of being a superhero.
  
 That's my favourite superhero. 
  
 I think he could beat up anyone.

After the earthquake the tsunami came and destroyed many houses and buildings. People were really scared and they were doing anything to get saved from the tsunami. Some people jumped into a river because the sea was really big and it was really fast. Some people stood on a boat to wait for the tsunami and others hid in a cave. After the tsunami the people realised that they had not left the place and it was safer to stay there and the tsunami did not come.

     Mysteries are a great topic. The most popular type of mystery is whodunit. One suspect is suspected of having committed a crime, but the person who did the crime has not been identified yet. Another type of mystery is criminal, like a murder mystery or a theft mystery. Even though most people might know who did what crime, the reader is not able to solve the crimes by himself or herself.
Mysteries usually focus on solving a mystery. When the reader knows who did what crime, it is called a non-mystery, especially when the perpetrator knows or has been revealed to the reader. For the most part, mysteries are fun to read and fun to solve. Even if you don't solve them right away, you will still learn a great deal about the characters and the plots, and the mystery will still be interesting. If you like the reading of mysteries, and you don't mind solving the puzzles, this topic is a great one for you to read. 


You can try this topic by reading a mystery book and solving the crimes in it. Then, try to do the same with some of the more obscure books in the genre. If the book gets challenging too quickly, you can try reading some of the shorter or older books in the genre, and if you are still able to solve the mysteries, then you know this topic is for you.

Finally, the pirate found an treasure: a piece of blue ice. He put it in his bag with delight, and when he put his bag over his shoulders, he was glad that it was cold. He put his bag on his shoulder, and the sea was calm. But when he got to the shore, he saw something strange. People were looking at the bag, and they all saw that it was a piece of blue ice.

     She was asked to find and complete four quests. The first quest was to find the sun, the second was to look for the moon, the third was to find the moon in the sky, and the fourth quest was to find the cat and the fish in the pond.

     The battle of the Bulge was a bloody and savage conflict which took place between Allied forces and German forces between 18 December 1940 and 11 January 1945 in and around the city of Ardennes, Belgium. It was one of the major battles of World War II.  The battle took place in three locations: the Ardennes forests, the Ardennes region, and on the German-occupied side of the River Ardennes.  A total of 3,000,000 Germans, along with 4,000,000 Allied troops were involved.   The Allied victory was aided by a major wintertime attack of the Allies against the Germans in the Ardennes region during December, December/January, and February, followed by repeated offensives.   Allied forces eventually pushed the German forces out of the Ardennes region and forced them to retreat west, eventually through the Netherlands, and into France.   The British were in charge of the invasion, which started on 11 November.  The Germans held out in the Ardennes forests for nearly a month; the Germans hoped to trap the Allies in the Ardennes region, cut off Allied forces from the rest of the country and thus slow the Allied advance. The Germans and their Allied partners had succeeded in encircling the Allied forces and preventing them from moving in a unified direction.  However, the Germans eventually made a tactical U-turn in the region, and after several weeks of stalemate, the Germans suffered a heavy loss when two of their"

     The myths about the color violet

The color violet has always been associated with myths and superstitions. The Romans thought that it killed the lover after which the victim turned red. Many cultures believed that it was the soul's way out of the human body after death, and it is still associated with that belief in some cultures. Its use as a perfume or dye is often attributed to the goddess of the moon, Isis, who brought it to Egypt. Its name comes from the Latin word viaticum, meaning ""blood"".

In the Old Testament, the color violet was a symbol of death and mourning.  The color violet was also associated with the destruction of Sodom by God as a punishment for its sins.

It is important to note that violets do not necessarily have to be blue. Violet has been used as the color for mourning and death, and it has sometimes been associated with purification and rebirth.

It is worth mentioning that some cultures use violet as the color for the dead. This may be due to the fact that it is the symbol for mourning and death. Many cultures use purifying rites or colors at funerals, and violet has sometimes been used as a color for this purpose.

     The Wizard of Oz ""Toto"" Speaks
    The Wizard of Oz (WOZ) is a famous 1939 American fantasy film directed by Frank T. Burton and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Thomas L. Nolan.
    The film starred Judy Garland, Lili Langley, Robert Ryan, Henry Travers and Christopher Marlowe. The plot follows Dorothy Gale and her companions, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, on a journey through Oz to rescue their lost friend.
    In the film, Toto‚Äîone of the characters in the film‚Äîis a yellow dog voiced by John Barrymore, who is unable to speak properly.
    Toto can be considered to be a loyal companion.
    The Wizard of Oz was the last sound film by Barrymore, who died while making the film. Barrymore and Garland had been friends since their earlier days together on Broadway, and he often joked that he had brought his own canine to help him through the sound recording process.
    Barrymore originally auditioned for the part of Dorothy's dog, but was rejected for being too dark-haired. This casting decision was changed when the film was nearing production. When Barrymore heard that the part of Toto was still open, he went back and auditioned for it. This time he was selected, but the film ran into production delays due to the producers"

     There was a kingdom. In the kingdom there were two kings, whose wives hated each other, because they looked exactly alike. And in the kingdom there was a castle. And in the castle there were several guards. And when the king sent an order to give the orders to his guards, the guards did not obey him. The king sent a second order, but the guards just didn't pay attention. And the king sent a third order, but when he turned round, he saw the two kings were kissing.

The beast was so fast that I couldn't catch it. I couldn't hear what it was saying to me, I couldn't see its eyes, I couldn't smell it. I could only feel its sharp claw on my skin. Its teeth felt so cold. But I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.

Suddenly, the beast was gone. I didn't know where it had gone. I was shaking so much that I had to sit down. I took out my phone. There was a call waiting from my father. It was an emergency and I had to answer quickly. I had to tell him what happened.

     An island is a group of smaller land masses with the same physical features, like geography or topography.  However, an island is an object with no solid or liquid surface.  These islands do not have any part of the ocean attached to them, thus their surfaces are not able to be touched, as is true of other objects on earth.  The island also has no living organisms on it, as is true of any land mass on earth.  It has its own name, like a continent does, and it is named after the person who discovered the land mass, as is true of the continents.  As you can see, the person who discovered the island is also the one who discovered the continent.  They are the same person because, as we know, there is only one planet called earth, but many different land masses.  This is because the person who discovered the island is an individual of that land mass.  This is also the reason that they are both located near each other.  For this reason, they are always referred to as the same land mass, even though they are clearly two separate land masses.  This is true of other land masses as well, such as the country they are a part of, which are also considered one land mass and have the same name as the land mass it belongs to.

     My Favorite Fairytales

There's no such thing as evil in fairy tales. And even if there were, I doubt that it would last very long. In order to get rid of evil, you'd have to kill all the good fairy tale characters too. Then what would be left?

Fables are the stories that our parents told us when we were young to teach us about the world and how it operates. Like fairy tales, these are stories with moral themes and fables are the oldest and most popular of this genre.

In order to help us understand fables as we read them today, they must first be understood as oral storytelling. Fables, like fairy tales, were originally oral stories; and, like fairy tales, the meaning of these oral fables has changed and evolved over time.  

In my personal opinion, fables are the best type of story to tell children. There is always a moral that is intended to be learned, but you never know what the moral will be until the story is finished. The moral is almost always an ""ask and ye shall receive"" type of moral, meaning you never have to ask for anything in life. 

So, the moral of these tales can be summed up in one word, ‚Äúbe good to others‚Äù, meaning the children must live by their actions and not by what they say they will do.

     This past week, I learned that sorcerers are people who learn magic. Sorcerers are, well, sorcerers, but not all sorcerers have the ability to learn magic. A sorceresses cannot learn magic, as I can easily tell because I am a sorceress, and I can easily do magic and I am not a sorcerer. This means that sorcerers are magic users while sorceresses are not. Also, there are four types of sorcerers, but only three types of sorceresses. The types of sorcerers are wizard, warlock, priest and sorcerer, which you may have seen on television if you watched that show. I would suggest trying out your wizarding powers tonight, while everyone is asleep. A sorcerer is very powerful and can make anyone into a warlock, which makes them very dangerous. You will not want to be a warlock. In conclusion, sorcerers are very powerful but should be avoided. In addition, there are also many other types of sorceresses in the Harry Potter series, but only three types of sorcerers. The types of sorceresses are witch, fairy, enchantress, and muggle, and they all perform magical activities. So, while they are not very powerful, you may wish to avoid these types of sorceresses.

""Hello"", the lizard responded, ""what do you want?"" ""I want to see if there is gold here"", replied the pirate. ""Why don't you come along with me?

     It's easy to be amazed at the breadth and depth of the human mind, but many of the best mental challenges involve the kinds of mental agility that aren't taught in school or college ‚Äî like recognizing patterns and trends, figuring out how things fit together, and figuring out the simplest way to solve a problem.
That's one of the reasons scientists and engineers use a set of techniques they call ""design thinking."" The idea is that you use a series of steps to explore a problem and identify a better, simpler solution before you reach a conclusion. The design process makes use of the design thinking techniques that have been developed by researchers in the fields of psychology, engineering, and architecture. You can find more information about design thinking at this site about the field. 
Here's how it works: The person leading the discussion goes through a series of steps to figure out the problems, which could be as simple as how to make a pair of tennis shoes or as complex as trying to save a village from a flood. And, the leader creates a set of design problems that fit together in a compelling, user-friendly way. You then use the design thinking techniques to brainstorm possible solutions. The solution that's easiest to solve is the one that should be chosen. 
Once you solve a problem using design thinking, you can continue to refine the design as the idea is tested. You can try more alternatives, you can look at the design from different angles, and the process keeps on getting easier"

     ""Survivors"" (Story 1 of 10)

When you are hit by a car at high speed, you know what you feel: instant terror. Suddenly, you are floating in the sky, in the dark, with a broken neck and no means of contacting anyone or anything. In all probability, you are dead.

Fortunately, you are not dead, and miraculously your life is saved by someone who is lying on the ground, unconscious. He doesn't notice you at first, because he is completely immobilized. In fact, he is still unconscious when you take a few seconds to think about your situation, and suddenly, you spot a house in the distance.

With fear, you realize that you are on a street surrounded by trees. Fortunately, you can climb one of the trees and jump onto the roof. Looking around, you realize that you are not alone.

There are two people, lying on the ground, just like you. They look a bit as if they were dead. With the help of the two people, you move them on the ground and in a position where they will be able to stand. However, because of the severity of their wounds, they will need to spend some time on the ground.

In the meantime, they are conscious and alert. After you get them into a better position, they tell you that they are survivors.

At that point, you have no other option but to explain the situation"

My heart rate would rise and my breath would slow down. The moment would be over and tomorrow we would continue on our journey, hoping we would always be able to find this one perfect spot on this mountain. But the moment would be over. Tomorrow was a day to look forward to. Tomorrow was another day. But today was the one day that counted and I would never forget it. Today. I stared at the warriors that stood before me, proud and strong. I knew I could conquer the moment but it was never about the moment itself. It was about the time that I was given. And that time would be mine. Heed my words carefully. For I would be silent for a whole second. I would wait for that moment to end. I would think of my family and my friends and where I would go after my time here on this mountain. And then the moment would be over. The warriors would take turns. Some would take off and some would wait. But then the moment would be over. The warriors took their turns. The mountain would fall into a valley. I would follow the warriors to the valley.

     The World's End

Fiona was just about to leave the pub with her friends when she got a call saying that her grandmother had collapsed in the middle of dinner. Fiona decided to go and find her grandmother and asked her friends to give them a lift to their flat. After arriving, she discovered that there was a big emergency on. She realized that her grandmother had collapsed suddenly and went to take some first aid courses to know what to do with her.
Fiona and her friends took turns in taking care of her grandmother, checking whether she was unconscious or just not feeling well. The grandmother was not in a good condition, which is why Fiona and her friends called an ambulance. Fortunately, the ambulance came in time and the grandmother recovered enough to go home.

Fiona and her friends took a long walk in the countryside to regain their energy. They arrived back at the pub and noticed that they were not alone in their grief as they saw a large group of people drinking. One of them asked, ""Did you see what happened in your grandmother's house?"" Fiona answered, ""Yes. Her daughter died in childbirth."" They then went to her flat to inform her neighbors.

The neighbors looked relieved. They felt sorry for her that she has to deal with so many sad events in her life, especially after she was married. Fiona had never thought about the fact that she would lose a close family member in her youth. The neighbors invited her and her friends to their"

     A civilization grew and spread throughout the world, leaving their mark on many nations. The people of this empire were proud, strong, and feared by their enemies. However, the emperor of this empire grew tired of ruling and one night, he was abducted and transported to another realm. In this realm, the emperor was no longer surrounded by a powerful army of loyal soldiers and followers. In fact, this other realm had no people and the emperor and his followers were the only living beings. The king of this realm was unsure whether to let the emperor live or kill him. The king and the emperor agreed on a deal in which the emperor would be free to die after making a wish, but if the emperor's wish was to not be followed, then he would be killed instead. The king agreed to the terms and gave the emporer one last night to sleep before his death. The emporer wished for his soldiers to guard his empire at all costs. He wished for his people to be happy. While this wish was not the most difficult to accomplish, it was a bit risky. So, the emporer and his soldiers were happy and they protected their empire, but in return, the emperor and his followers could not be happy either. The king could not decide which way to go. One day, the king became tired of his position and made the difficult decision to kill the emperor, not because he was tired of his job, but because he was tired of being king. The"

     Ralph is a young wizard, his favorite pastime is playing chess, however, there are a few rules that he likes to follow.
1. He loves to play chess against others, but never against himself. This is because he knows that he could win his game if he wins the first move, yet he knows that if he makes his first move on his own, there is no way he can win the game.
2. He always has the most advanced chess pieces. For this reason, he always wins.
3. He is very particular with how the pieces are positioned. If a piece is in the wrong spot, he will quickly remove it from the board and re-position it in a better spot. In addition, he only uses the pieces of his opponent's colors.
So far, these three rules seem fairly standard for a young wizard. However, Ralph always finds a new way to solve his problems.
One day, Ralph was playing his favorite pastime chess against a new young witch. While Ralph was playing a very long game, which included many moves, he noticed that one of his opponent's pieces was no longer in the correct spot. Since he is very particular with his pieces, he quickly removed it from the board, placed it correctly, and waited to see if the witch would notice the error.

It was a gorgeous sight, especially when the rain that had started just before had stopped, giving us a spectacular sunset. Suddenly, I heard a scream. I looked up and saw this beautiful girl that I just met, lying on the ground with one hand around her throat, and another hand on her face. I quickly ran towards her, but as I reached her I saw a strange beast rising up from the ground and coming towards me. I was so nervous that I dropped my bag, and the bag contained my iPhone 6 Plus. I ran as fast as I could, towards the phone and saw there was an alarm on. There was also some blood on my phone.

     As you can see, one of the most important points for your students will be that they shouldn't read anything on this topic that they are unable to understand. In order to make sure they get it, they must give your opinion about the text and you can't hide behind an opinion. You must provide a brief comment about what kind of text you've read (if you have), what points did you think were good or bad about it and explain your opinion about it. You can make use of a short anecdote, short story or some comments from a poem or something like this. Try to read this task in the way that students will be able to read it. It is difficult for them to read something they find too long and hard to understand so, it will definitely be less enjoyable for them to do it if you make it long and too difficult to read.
It is also important that you provide some structure to the text. You should make use of the sentences of longer texts to make your point. For instance, the beginning of your short story should be the same as that of a longer text. If you start your story with some sentences of a longer text, it will sound better and will leave the reader with a sense that the story is a part of a whole and that there is a sequence between them. You can also combine two shorter text and create a narrative with them.

     Zombies are always hungry, but not everyone thinks so. In some places, the zombies do not eat at all; in others, they eat only rotten or spoiled food, and in others, they kill the human beings. The most interesting zombies are slow and stupid, and the most deadly are faster and stronger. Some zombie groups are clever; others are not. Some zombies have more friends than others; others are alone and hate them for it. Some groups have a very low IQ; others are brilliant. Some are clever enough to trick people into thinking that they are not infected; others are not and can only live with them. In some places, the zombies are more intelligent than the human beings.

          The word ""zombies"" is used in many different ways. Some zombie stories are very serious and talk about people who want to escape or fight back against the zombies. These types of zombie stories also tell about how it will be difficult to survive because of the many things that can go wrong. Other zombie stories are very funny and talk about the way zombies eat human flesh. These stories also teach that there are other ways to survive other than living with zombies.
          Zombies are a very old and interesting concept. Many famous and many not so famous authors have written zombie stories. Here is a list of some of them, and I will give some explanations for each story.

The task is to generate a short story that uses the subject word ‚Äútime-travelers‚Äù in a way that is readable and is in accordance with the common core standards.
Time travel is the use of the future or past to influence the present or future.  This type of time travel involves traveling back in time.  While this is considered to be the most difficult type of time travel, it is also the most possible.  One of the most famous examples of time travel is in the movie ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù.
In order to create a story using the subject word ‚Äútime-travelers‚Äù, you will have to consider three main factors.  These are a title, the setting, and characters.  Consider what your story will be about, then select a suitable setting.  Then, consider characters and the relationships between them.  Finally, create a title that will draw the reader in.
The title for your story could be something like ‚ÄúSpace Time-Travelers‚Äù.  This would give the reader a clear idea that they are in the presence of time-travelers.  The setting could be a space station of some sort.
This place could be a small town in an unnamed planet. "

     The Story Of A Boy And A Pig 
One day, a boy named Luke was playing outside in a garden with his little sister, Toni. He wanted to find a frog he could kill.
He looked under every rock, behind every bush, and in every corner. After searching for a while, he decided to give up, but as he was leaving, he ran into a little pig named Piggy, who was eating grass in the garden. He asked her what she was doing there and why she was eating grass.
Piggy replied: ""It's the best grass for me. After I ate it, I became very happy and my piggy friends told me to eat it every day. I'm so happy I don't even care about grass at all anymore, but I miss my friends.""
""But why didn't you just stay in the pigpen?"" asked Luke.
Piggy said: ""I was born outside. I don't know about a pigpen, but I grew up in the wild. I can't remember where I came from.""
""What do you do?"" asked Luke.
""I look for food,"" said Piggy.
""And I look for friends,"" she said.
Toni thought about what Piggy was saying. ""Do you talk?"" she asked.
""I talk to the sky, the grass, the wind, and any other animals I meet,"" replied Piggy.

     Three legends of the ancient world are told. Each legend is told with a different theme.  Each legend focuses on ancient Greece. In the first legend, the two stories are interwoven, but are otherwise entirely different. The legend tells a tale of a young priest named Polyeuctes who was banished from the island he was born on for his lack of faith. When Polyeuctes meets a slave girl named Iole who is from a tribe of giants, he helps her to escape the island.  He tells her story of how they escape and eventually reach the island of Sparta. Eventually, Polyeuctes becomes friends with King Leotychides and learns how to speak the king's language, or as it was then called, the lyre.  Polyeuctes travels to Athens where he helps the Athenians to overthrow King Dionysus.  The story ends with Polyeuctes in Athens telling the story of his life to his friend Eurylochus.  When Polyeuctes learns of his friends death he decides to travel to the island that he was born on.  He meets and speaks with the goddess Eurydice who offers to help Polyeuctes return to the island.  After Eurydices death, Polyeuctes returns to the island with the aid of a young woman named Leda.  Eventually, Polyeuctes returns to Sparta and tells his friends story to King Leot"

I also bought an iPhone so that I could take pictures. I have never seen such huge billboards before. The traffic lights seemed to be on the blink as well. The yellow taxi had no problems getting to the airport. I arrived and saw a lot of people in business attire. They were standing in line in front of shops. They looked nervous. I was surprised. They told me the prices for the shops. I bought a pair of shoes. The shop-keeper said that I had to return later to try them on. I was disappointed. I thought I would be able to do this right now, but the shop-keeper didn't let me. I was angry with her. I looked at all of the people in front of the shops. They were all nervous. I looked at my yellow taxi. It had a comfortable seat. I was relaxed. I wondered if they felt the same way. I wondered what they were doing wrong.

     The first question on the test is to give me a list of quests. I didn't know what a quest was so I looked it up on the internet and the first result was this list from Wikipedia:

""Quest or quest-quest is a roleplaying game term that refers to the story of the main quest in a roleplaying game. ""

So now I'm looking for a quest, but don't know where to start. So, I google ""quest"", which I'm guessing is a question asking for search results based on the user's search parameters, and I found this, which has these search criteria:

""A simple question asking for search results based on the tags 'quest','shortstory', or 'poetry' or the words 'long','short' or 'free'.""

I've tried to make my query as simple as possible and my search came back with this, which includes many different types of questions about a wide variety of subjects, including

questions about poetry and short stories
questions about books
questions about science fiction and fantasy
questions about novels and their genres

He picked up his sword and continued through the forest. As he neared the city walls, he heard a cry of ""Help, I'm under attack!"" He ran over to the city gate and entered the city.

Anya was a little bit annoyed as she and her friends decided to play a fun game. She tried not to think about that this game was going to change her life.

She was invited to spend the weekend with her friend Julia. But it was not about having fun at that moment. Julia was going to do a spell and she wanted to use Anya's name as the object. As the game starts, the two kids started to read their cards.

Anya looked quickly at her card and then smiled. She read the name Julia and she felt happy. This is how they were playing the game.

Later in the afternoon, Julia called Anya and told her she had a surprise for her.

They both went to the woods. There was a beautiful pond, an old house, some trees, and a little bridge. A small path led from the house towards the woods. The house was old and had a long garden. As Julia said, she had a present for Anya.

     The Kingdom of Aragon
         The land of Aragon is located in Spain. Spain is located in Western Europe between Germany and France. Aragon is one of the four independent kingdoms that existed in Spain during its history. All of Spain is not a single country. It has a central government which is responsible for the laws, customs, and regulations of the whole nation. Aragon is located in the northeast corner of Spain. As the name suggests, the main language in Aragon is Spanish. However, there are also many cultures with their own languages here. The most spoken language in Aragon is the Catalan language.

     The Story of the Ant and the Mouse

The ant and the mouse lived happily ever after, until one day the ant noticed a piece of leftover food near the entrance to his nest, he picked it up with one hand while holding his wife with the other and took it home to share with his family. The mouse on the other hand saw the ants dirty work and got annoyed, it left the nest and headed towards the food the ant's left for its dinner. The mouse didn't realize the ants' work was already done until he found himself in the nest. The ants realized that the mouse had broken through the nest's entrance and they called for help. Before the mouse could escape, his fate was sealed.

The ant returned from his dirty work, he gave the mouse a piece of his leftover food, the mouse thanked the ants for their help and took off to his own nest. The mouse thought his own life was much easier than the ant's, but in his opinion he was wrong. The mouse knew he wouldn't be able to escape the nest so the ants took care of everything, they fed him and watered him, they even took care of his health and even groomed him when he got a sunburn. But the mouse didn't realize how lucky he was until the ants said goodbye to him and flew away. The mouse realized that he was in a much better situation than the ant but he didn't understand what his problem was.

You may see a pirate rowing their ship down the mighty stream.

But if you're a pirate and you go to a city,
You're sure to come face to face with the king!
His name is Jafar and he rules over many lands.

He's a ruthless and a sadistic man.
And you know that if you're a pirate that's in his town,
They'll torture you and then hang you from a gallows.

Their ships have a rough ride, their crew be tough too.
The food be gruel, the water be gruel, their pay be gruel too.
But they never let any of that stop them.
So the best way to be a pirate is to think about it.

     It was a lovely day. The sun shone brightly and there was a gentle breeze. The air was clean and fresh. There were birds chirping in the trees and bees buzzing in the flowers. Everyone was happy. Then the king was pleased to learn from his courtiers that there were problems in a neighboring village. The King asked one of his courtiers to go and see what was wrong, to visit the villages, and to report to the King what he had found out. As the courtier was leaving, the King asked him how he was travelling. The courtier, who was not really a king‚Äôs man, replied to say that he was very unhappy. But when he arrived at the village, he saw that nothing at all was wrong there. He had been told to go to the next village to see if anything was wrong there and he had been promised five coins if he found anything wrong. When he arrived, however, he found only a beautiful woman in the garden, and she was playing a song. The courtier was quite jealous and he wanted to have her for himself, so he took her to his cottage for a chat. The woman was quite happy and she was eager to hear what he had to say. She asked him what he wanted to do with her and he answered that he would go to the village and find out what was going on, as he was there on a mission of the utmost importance, and then he would take her to his cottage"

     A man and woman are talking about something. Man: You can see the walls, don't you, and hear the bells? Woman: Yes, I know.

The walls are so high now, I can almost touch them.  (pause) And yet, I bet it's so hard to look at them knowing that you've made them stronger. I hope they stay that strong, even though the town has grown.  (pause) Now I think about it, I wonder how they would've felt if they'd seen the castle.

     Galaxies are enormous, immense things.  They're so enormous, that if you're looking at the entire universe, you'll have to look at it from a distance of about 150 trillion miles.  Not to mention the fact that there are over 300,000 galaxies.  They are like galaxies in so many ways.  They each have a very unique color.  There's a specific color that all of the galaxies have: red.  For instance, if a galaxy was to be so far away that you could see it just by squinting really hard, you would be able to see that galaxy's light.  There's another color that makes up over 90% of the universe: dark, black.  This is all because galaxies and galaxies are made up of dark matter.  They're made up of dark matter because there's very little matter in the universe that is transparent and can be seen.  It's dark because of all of the galaxies and everything else in the universe.  It is this dark, black, stuff in the universe that makes up the rest of it.

Then one evening it came to the conclusion that it would like to sleep in its house. It slept in the robot. The robots were too scared to leave their master, so they stayed with the robot. When night fell, they took turns guarding their master. Then the robot woke up from his sleep. He knew he had to go back to his home, but it was very difficult to leave his master. The robots, though, were a little confused, because their master didn't know how to communicate with them. Then the robot told his robots to sleep in their houses. He'd sleep in the robot, and his robots would sleep in their houses. He then lay down to sleep. When night fell, the robots felt sad because they missed their master.

He thought he'd be back soon, but the store wasn't very far from his home. After he left his home, his robots had lots of thoughts in their heads. They were sad to see their master walking alone outside. They wanted to go home, but they didn't know how to tell their master that they had left him.

     There was once a group of survivors on the sea coast. They were all living their own lives without getting influenced by the outside world. One day, as always they were swimming in the sea. And then, out of the blue, a boat appeared from the sky and threw out three of them. The man, the woman and the kid were thrown to the boat. The woman took a look at the surroundings and then she and the child boarded the boat. The man stayed with his companion. But when the boat was moving towards the land, all three of them turned and saw the other survivor, watching them from a distance. As they looked at each other, the man was surprised to see that the other man was also an islander. The islander was watching them too. All three of them stood there for some time, not knowing what to do. They were helpless, when suddenly the boat arrived at a small beach. They all jumped out. The woman with the child took the child towards the forest and the man with the companion went towards the river. Then the boat pulled out of the beach. The other survivor was not so lucky. He was still in the same place, and this time he was surrounded by a group of people from the town. They asked him who he was. He replied that he was a boatman and that he was looking for his boat.

     The History of Europe: Empires of the Middle Ages
        The history of Europe's empires has been one of conflict and turmoil.  However, the Middle Ages were not a time of peace and prosperity. Rather, wars and outbreaks of plague were often the norm, leaving the European populations impoverished and demoralised, as well as causing widespread famine.

       The early Middle Ages is a period of relative calm.  However, this changed from the mid-12th century onwards, when wars and outbreaks of plague became more frequent.  The Black Death in 1348 left between half and two-thirds of the population dead in Europe.  This, combined with the Norman invasion of France in 1235, resulted in the loss of France's central authority, as well as the end of the Franciscan order in Western Europe.  The end of the reign of the Merovingian dynasty in 994 also resulted in France becoming isolated from the Roman Empire.

Each has a spell that needs to be cast, and each has been searching for a magical item. Each wizard is currently engaged in a particularly tricky and dangerous spell. It looks like the wizards will need a break from their busy schedules at some point. What can they do? Perhaps they could go to the lake where the magic began. That is a good idea.

     We are going to play a little game.  The game consists of three criminals: Robert, Fred, and Mike.  You are asked to read a text and describe the three criminals.  Here's the rule: You get ten words to come up with a description.  Each word count is the number of times you can repeat it, so if you repeat a word three or more times, you do not need to include it in your description.  Feel free to use the entire description if you like.
    Robert is an educated man.  He always reads and he speaks English well.  However, there is a little difference between Robert and Fred.  Fred is a little rough.  Robert, on the other hand, is very polite.
    Mike is a simple guy.  He is very friendly and sometimes he acts stupid.  He doesn't know what he's saying sometimes but when he's with friends he can be very funny.  Mike never reads, and he speaks very bad English.
    All three criminals are in prison and this is the reason that each of them is in prison.  The only thing that they have in common is that they always try to get out of prison.  When they're out of prison, they will change again.  They will always return to prison.  It's hard to change but they have to try.  Robert is a very intelligent man, but he makes a mistake once"

    1. Meaning or purpose: The text can range from containing a single level of meaning to multiple levels of meaning based on complexity.
    2. Structure: A text with low complexity tends to have simple, well-marked, and conventional structures, whereas a text of high complexity tends to have complex, implicit, and unconventional structures. Simple texts tend to relate events in chronological order, while complex texts make more frequent use of flashbacks, flash-forwards, and other manipulations of time and sequence. 
    3. Lengths: That text that has longer words and longer sentences are more difficult to read than shorter ones. A text with many long words and/or sentences is thus rated by these formulas as harder to read than a text with many short words and/or sentences would be.

     I'm reading The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, by E. M. Forster, and I'm interested in your opinion on that story. When we read it in class, the students liked the story and seemed to get the idea of ghosts. This makes me want to read more books about ghosts to see if I can understand more about them. So here is the story: 
                              The ghost's name was Robert Muir. 
                                 His wife was called Mrs. Muir. 
                                  They lived in a London house, and they lived very happily in their house for forty years. But one day, they both had a sad, strange dream. 
                               Robert Muir had a terrible dream. He was driving along the country road. There was a very terrible fog. And he was on the road for a long way in the fog. Then he came to"

     Jude and his wife, Evelyn, both live in an isolated neighborhood, which they call Hilltop. They have a large family consisting of their two children, Daniel and Sally, and many servants and friends. They live in a beautiful house near the sea. The two are happy with their lives, but Daniel feels uneasy whenever someone from the outside approaches them, due to his fear of vampires. 

Jude had to work on a car in order to earn enough money to buy his parents a holiday in Italy, but the moment he finished, he was attacked by three vampires. He was bitten all over his body and was left with bloodstained clothes. The three vampires walked to the nearest church, where they tried to find a doctor, but all they found was a priest named Fr. Thomas. Fr. Thomas administered to Jude, and Jude woke up the next day at his house. He had to work in order to take care of his family, but felt even less safe than he did the previous day. He had to take a shower in order to get rid of the vampires' blood, but he was bitten again. He woke up in the middle of the night to see his wife, who had a strange look on her face and was holding her throat. 

The two were attacked by the same three vampires, and they were able to kill them. However, the three vampires left behind the vial containing their blood in Jude's garage. Daniel had noticed that"

     The best place to be in a time of plague is a witches' cave.

It's really quiet here, I think I'll have a look around.

I wonder if anyone's made a potion yet.


There aren't any witches here. How disappointing.

It's really dark in here. I can barely see.

But a witch was behind me. She was so ugly I couldn't look at her. I only saw her face in a shadow.

I ran as fast as I could away from her. I felt so weak.

I can't hear anything else now. Only that horrible witch's voice in my head.

     The Zombies Are Coming!
by Peter L. Pan

The zombies are coming!
And they are hungry!
But they don‚Äôt care what you have to say!

They'll eat your brains, and they'll eat your bones!

And they don't give a darn if you scream!

The zombies are coming!
You better run and hide from them!

Cause they‚Äôll chew you up and spit you out!

And if you're unlucky,
They might even try to eat your soul!

The zombies are coming!
The zombies are coming!
The zombies are coming!
The zombies are coming!

I've done this story because I feel that Christmas and the zombie apocalypse go hand in hand. That's why there are zombies coming, and also that's why it's an apocalypse. Also I wanted it to have a classic, simple structure. I wanted it to be short so it wouldn't take too long to"

     Angels: They are mysterious beings, yet they were created by god and were created for good. As much as I hate them, I love them at the same time. However, they do have a bad reputation in the society they live in and they are considered sinners. I don't like their reputation but I will explain why they have that reputation to you. Angels are very helpful to humans, for example, they are the angels who are on guard over children so they would not harm them. However, they also have the power to be very destructive to humans. Angels are the ones who deliver the bad news, such as death, to humans. In fact, they also had the power to change fate, such as to prevent the destruction of humanity, or to allow the destruction of humanity. God himself gave all the powers to angels. As for their reputation among humans, angels should not be trusted, especially when they are sent by God himself.
