1,"adventures You are a sailor and have set off with your friend, on a trip. In the beginning you are fine, but after a while your friend starts to feel bad. You need to figure out what is going on.  You ask your friend and he says he feels unwell. You also notice he is constantly coughing, as he is near to the ocean.
The sea water is dirty and is causing him to get ill. You can't help but feel worried as you see your friend get ill.  Your friend feels sick as well, so it's not just you getting sick!  You have to find out what is happening.  If you want to make things better, you need to find out what is causing the problem.
Make an outline of the problems your friend might have been experiencing. Write down the symptoms they've had over the past few days and how they have affected them. Do some research to find out what is going on and see if you can discover the cause of the symptoms. You could come up with a few hypotheses, such as:

It's just the sea water that is causing the illness; it could be a bacterial infection.
The water is the cause and your friend is just too weak to fight it off; this is probably why he's coughing constantly.

Make a couple of tests to check for any bacteria you think are causing the illness. You could take a swab from their nose or mouth or a sample of mucus"
1,"mysteries The adventures of two eccentric detectives whose unorthodox methodologies frequently clash with their clients. The two characters are played by Michael J. Fox and David Hasselhoff. Fox's character, the quirky Detective Eddington, tries to find the truth about the disappearances of two young women in a futuristic world of computers. Hasselhoff's character, the ruthless Private Investigator Rick Anderson, investigates a series of murders where the victims are all given names of celebrities, and he becomes obsessed with the celebrities' life, until he is caught in the crossfire of these murders and is killed by one of the victims, who is named after Hasselhoff. The show was intended as an extension of the ""Baywatch"" franchise, as both Fox and Hasselhoff were under contract for one season each to star in the show. The series has been successful, making a profit in most of its seasons. However, in the United Kingdom, where the show is most popular, a ""canned"" version of the series was aired with Hasselhoff and Fox not being involved. The series has been revived for another season in the United States by The CW. The series airs at 8pm ET on Thursday nights. However, in 2007, Hasselhoff has signed on as a cast member of ""Dancing With The Stars"", so Fox will be on the show for a second consecutive season, taking Hasselhoff's slot for ""Baywatch"", and for the new show ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"
1,"legends The following is a list of legends about characters who appeared in The Legend of Zelda video games. The number and spelling of some legends may have changed over time; if you know the details of another legend that should have made the list but has not, please edit the corresponding legend. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild contains a number of references to some legends mentioned here.
The Legend of Zelda, abbreviated as LOZ, refers to the franchise as a whole or to one particular game. Some characters (such as Link, Zelda, and Mario) have become very popular throughout the decades; however, most characters within the series do not have as much of a dedicated fan base as Mario or Zelda.
""Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"" (or simply, ""Ocarina"") is a 3D adventure game made by Nintendo that was released in July of 1998. It was the series' first title for the Game Boy Advance. The game takes place in a medieval kingdom where people live in ""Ocarinas"", also known as ""Setsuna"", and where they listen to music from a radio station, The Masked Ball. The main characters are Link and Princess Zelda. The series of adventures began with this title.
This is the second installment in the Legend of Zelda series and the first installment for the GameCube. It is also the second installment of the main series. It tells the story of Link and his sidekick, Ganondorf,"
1,"dreams Dreams can be pretty weird, right? Most people don’t want to think about them because it just seems kind of weird. Well, a recent study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology may help you understand your dreams better.
One of the key findings of this study is that dreams are in fact a type of reflection. When someone has a dream, it can really be like they are reflecting on some past experience.
The dreamer can think back to some emotional experience that happened, or even an event that happened, which caused their dream. This experience is reflected in their dream.
Another interesting thing that was found is that dreams may also be a type of anxiety management strategy. Many people dream of escaping their problems in their everyday lives. Their dreams reflect a way of telling themselves that they can do it.
If you are constantly dreaming of escaping from something or someone, it might be a sign that you are really stressed out with your life. You should pay attention to this and figure out what is making you stressed out.
Take a look at your daily routine, figure out what is stressful you, and start working on a way to get yourself through that stressor.
There is a saying that life throws you many curves. If you are feeling stressed out or anxious about something in your life, perhaps it’s time to deal with it and figure out how to overcome it. You deserve to have a wonderful life, and dreams can make that"
1,"secrets We were watching the last episode of Breaking Bad a while back and came across a line from the character Jesse Pinkman. It was at a point where we hadn’t seen him for a while and he’s explaining that he’s gone on a dangerous mission and needed to pick up his things.
In a conversation with an old friend, my husband commented that Jesse had probably just stolen something. I got all embarrassed and corrected him.
He did not steal something!
I know. I know. I am not going to tell him I was lying either.
The reason we think this is because we used to have a cat called Walter White and the whole time I was pregnant with my daughter, whenever I saw a cat in a costume, I would say, “Does Walter know his own name?” My husband thought it was hilarious but now that he knows about the reference, he feels rather bad about it.
Now I have to live with him knowing that I used to talk like Walter White and that I have not stopped watching Breaking Bad even though my toddler is now old enough to have an opinion. The first thing she said to him the day we came back from the USA was, “Where’s your new hat?” and I know she means it.
This is probably the most embarrassing one that you’re gonna get, but we saw one of my friends running at the park yesterday, and as she was"
1,"journeys Journey
In this game you move your character through the landscape in a 3D environment. While trying to reach your destination, you have to manage various aspects of your character's character. Some aspects are more important than others. The elements of your character are temperature, your health, your stamina, your strength, and your perception. You can also add bonuses to certain aspects if you're playing on the harder difficulties.
As you move through the landscape you will encounter the elements of air, water, fire, electricity, wind, gravity and earth. On the harder difficulties there are more elements to encounter. You can also encounter enemies.
If you play on any difficulty level, a cut-scene plays and you begin with the game title.
You will also encounter enemies, which you can fight in any of these modes: fight, dodge, sneak, shoot or even heal.
Each type of terrain has a set of objectives and bonuses associated with that terrain. These bonuses are determined by the terrain type.
For example, the plains have more opportunities to interact with objects in the environment and there is a high chance to find some money. Snow has a high chance of dropping good quality ammunition.
In order to collect money you have to either open a box by shaking the box with the money inside or destroy a certain amount of objects in the environment.
On harder difficulties you can also find extra bonus objectives, which include unlocking items, gaining experience or finding a secret place or path"

The treasure is located on top of the cliff in the area that's indicated by the skull and crossbones (the area with the rock formations and the lava). 2. The app will allow you to see the locations of hidden chests and treasures in any game in the Minecraft 1.16.2 or 1.17.1 update as of 10 April 2017.
3. This will open the chests in the area that have been highlighted with the skull and crossbones icon.
4. This will open the chest for you.
5. You'll notice that this is a normal chest with no gold or items inside, but there is a block of wood.
6. As you'll notice, you'll now have one red block and four orange blocks. You'll need to combine all of these four blocks into a functioning block to craft a pickaxe.
7. Now it's your turn. You can find the necessary materials at the following locations:

1,"quests This article shows how to find the quest number of the game that you need help with, including quests that might require you to fight a boss monster. See How do I continue a quest? for information on other ways to help you continue your quest.
You can find the quest number simply by entering the title of the game into the search bar at the top of this page, or going to a game page (if you know the page's URL) and doing a quick Internet search for the title.
Most RPG (role-playing game) titles, both on console and PC, include the quest number in the title of the game and include it in the game's description somewhere. This can be particularly useful if you are playing a PC or console game online with others, and need to know for sure that the number is in the game you're playing. For example, you could go to the website for a game like World of Warcraft and ask, ""How do I find the quest number for the fight against Blackwing Lair?""
The list below shows some examples of RPG titles, each of which gives the quest number included in the title. Most PC games include the quest number in the title, while some console games do not (for example, Fallout 4 contains the title ""Fallout: New Vegas""), or don't include the quest number (for example, the RPG Legend of Zelda games have ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"" and ""The Legend of Zelda"
1,"battles I remember the time when I was so excited when my grandfather told me he wanted to visit the USA (we lived in Germany at the time). He used to tell me that the streets of New York were so huge. It was my first time in America and the idea that my grandfather had taken me to see skyscrapers was a real trip. My grandparents came to spend time with our family during their vacation in the States. Our family home was located in a quiet city on the outskirts of a big metropolis. That made the time with my grandparents even more special.
I remember the first day when we left the city. On our way to my grandparents’ place we saw so many trees and green spaces. It looked like a green planet. My grandfather told me that he wanted to buy a house in the middle of one of those fields but unfortunately he could not find an available plot. In the end he bought a small house in a quiet suburb.
My grandfather was very quiet but also a passionate person. He liked to go for walks and take part in the football matches in a club. I remember that I used to sit in front of the TV and listen to him talk, especially about music. In the summer, we used to play volleyball on my grandfather’s backyard. It was a really nice place.
I remember the time when my grandfather told me about how he had been in the United States to work for more than ten years. We didn’"
1,"myths If you have been following your doctor’s advice and haven’t lost weight during your pregnancy, there are a lot of things you could be doing.  Here are some common myths that could be hindering your efforts.

Myth #1: You will only lose weight if you start a special diet.

In fact, the majority of pregnant women do not need to follow special diets to lose weight. The goal is to eat a healthy diet and avoid gaining excess weight. A good, nutritionally balanced diet is the key to losing weight during pregnancy. 

Myth #2: Your body is meant to hold on to weight during pregnancy.

The truth is that although your body is designed to store excess fat during pregnancy, the baby’s growth spurts can cause this to change. 

If you continue to gain weight, your doctor may prescribe medicine or adjust your diet to help you lose weight.

Myth #3: You can't burn enough calories during pregnancy.

Losing weight while pregnant is not a lot harder than regular daily life. You can still exercise and be active. The key is to be smart with your exercise.

The best form of exercise for pregnant women is any form of exercise that does not cause strain on your body. That's any form of exercise that keeps you standing up straight.

Myth #4: You will have so much stress during pregnancy, you won’t"
1,"monsters A series of illustrations to accompany the short story by Raymond F. Feist entitled ""The Last Duel"", from his ""The Shadow Chronicles"" novel series. Each illustration shows two characters engaged in what would be a ""true"" duel, with a third person in the background observing and possibly helping in some way. When I first heard of ""The Last Duel"", I thought it would be a fun project, to get to draw the two main characters from the novel engaged in combat. I enjoyed making them, and getting to use my inker style a bit. As a ""thank you"" for choosing my illustrations, Ray Feist will also be donating five copies of the story, signed by him, as well as an e-book version of the book, which you can download on his website.

1,"kingdoms A kingdom is a state of relative autonomy.  There are several kinds of kingdoms, such as an elective monarchy and a hereditary monarchy. 
A hereditary monarchy is a monarchy in which the head of the state is a monarch selected by the citizens of the state, and has absolute powers.  Elective monarchy is where the head of the state is chosen by the people, but in return has only some powers. Elective monarchies can be either absolute or semi-absolute. 
A hereditary constitutional monarchy is where the head of state is elected by a council of state. This is a form of constitutional monarchy where the head of state has more power than normal because of the laws and traditions set down by the council.
A republic is a state governed by a constitution without an elected head of state.  The president of the republic may serve either directly or indirectly.  A republic may also be a constitutional monarchy, but with a directly elected head of state. 
An elected president is a type of elected president.
In a constitutional monarchy, a king is elected by a referendum to be the monarch of the state.  
The executive branch is an advisory branch to the monarch. The monarch appoints members of the council of state who are generally referred to as the cabinet. They are responsible for advising the monarch on policy and matters of state. The council is in charge of making most decisions, and the monarch signs off on them. However, the monarch can refuse the"

1,"voyages The French colonial expedition of the Marquis de Bougainville, under Captain Pierre Levasseur, set out from France in 1794 with the express purpose of discovering an easier way to India. Their ships sailed the coast of Western Australia, the north coast of Madagascar, and other nearby islands, before Bougainville and his crew were surprised in a fierce storm on 26 August 1795 by the British East India Company, under Captain James Cook, in the Pacific Ocean. Bougainville managed to escape from the ship with 20 men and two of Cook's men, but Cook was killed. The expedition made two landings: at Botany Bay and in the vicinity of the Sydney Harbour Islands. They spent much of the time on the west side of Australia, in the vicinity of the Torres Strait, and only set out for India again after three months in Australia, in late 1795. Bougainville and his men reached the Philippines in December 1796, but Bougainville later returned to Europe to continue his travels.   
In his later years, Bougainville spent considerable time in the British Virgin Islands. In February 1800, he was granted a residency in the capital of St. Thomas, and died there on 26 June 1823.

1,"curses Curses is a Python module which allows users to run interactive Python programs on Unix-like systems.
Unlike most interactive shell interfaces, curses is designed for direct interaction with the process, rather than using the process's shell. It also supports input from the screen, keyboard, mouse and so on. This allows curses to interact much better with many programs than the standard interactive interface of bash or zsh. 
Curses allows commands to be given, the interpreter to execute and any environment variable to be loaded. This means it is possible to run programs in a different environment with each command, and can provide an environment for use in other commands with the interpreter.
In addition, curses can be called from the command line. This is useful for using curses with programs that are not written for the interface and therefore may have bugs in curses-related command-line arguments. The curses module is also a standalone Python module that runs on many Unix variants.
Curses is distributed as a single source code file, curses.c, and is included in all Python distributions.

Since curses doesn't run on Linux, we're unlikely to get any specific requests for Linux use, and there would be a lot of work to translate curses from one set of environment variables to another.

It is the 22nd and final episode of the series' season and series. It aired on CBS in the United States on January 22, 1994.
In ""The Beast"", the Enterprise crew discover that the Borg collective has launched a biological attack on Earth. Picard tries to communicate with the Borg, but they respond by destroying the Enterprise. The Borg are later destroyed by the USS Pegasus, which comes to their defense. While Kirk tries to locate Borg ships in the Federation Fleet, Picard decides that the Borg must be removed from all inhabited space, or the human race will be destroyed. The episode was written by Mark L. Smith and directed by Michael Piller, his first time directing an episode of the series.
The episode is based on the 1973 science fiction film, The Beast (original title: ""The Evil Within""; also ""The Good Thing"", ""The Evil That Men Do"", ""The Beast Within"", ""The Good One"", ""The Beast Is Among Us"", ""The Evil Within II"" and ""The Evil Within"" (1995)).

Palau.
Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI).
Republic of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).

For the other countries of Micronesia see the article on the Federated States of Micronesia.
A non-self-governing island nation, Palau is recognized by the United Nations as an independent nation, the Republic of Palau.

Palau is one of the largest countries in the world, covering only 14,000 km2 (5,743 sq mi) of ocean. Despite its relatively small surface area, Palau has a unique landscape that includes coral islands, volcanic islets, man-made archipelagos and coral reefs. These are some of the most pristine environments left on Earth, and some of the world's most beautiful beaches are found in Palau. Although Palau is a member of the United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum, it is not a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which governs maritime affairs in the Western Pacific Ocean.

I'm a novice player. Can you walk me through the basic quests for me?
Can I join the Dragonborn quest line?
I want to do the Dark Brotherhood quests, but I don't know where to start. Can you walk me through the process?
How do I kill dragons?The easiest way to kill Dragons is to use the ElderScrolls.com dragon killer's guide.
Use an all-round, high-level character to kill the dragons. Ideally, choose a spell-casting character, because a strong attack build doesn't have much trouble hitting dragons.
Choose a follower who can handle ranged combat. If your follower doesn't have a bow (and thus can't hit the dragon) or if they lack the magic skill to target the dragon, you will probably need to run the first fight.
Once the dragons are out of the way, you have an easy time killing them.

1,"realms The realms are the vast domains in which the Elder Gods and the mortals interact, but only at high levels. They can be described as ""places where gods play"", where mortals and god-kings might talk to each other, but they're not real places. The realms can only exist when the Elder Gods agree to grant mortals such powers as the Eldar god of Time granted R'lyeh the ability to project shadows, or the Mists goddess Mimir, or the dwarf god Thorndinn. For mortals the realms are only temporary, and can never be inhabited (unless, as in ""Purgatory"" and ""Valhalla"", they exist in the present as a sort of parallel universe to the material world). However, they can play a role in events outside of mortals' control: for example, in ""Purgatory"" the realm of Fafnir and the realm of Jörmungandr, both connected to the mortal world in some way, were used to grant Loki's wish to reverse the fall of Asgard by allowing Thor to kill him and bring him back to life, and thus allow the gods to take over the world. The realms are often referenced in myths, myths which are stories written down by humans about the realities of the gods' lives; as a result they are described both by mortals and gods as an actual place, but are usually just a single space (e.g., the realm of Death, the realm of Fafnir, or the"

1,"fables The Oldest Story Tellings in the World: Why Animals Still Regard Humans as Stupid
What are our favorite children's stories? For many, it is difficult to answer that question without first considering some of the other stories that have been told, in different languages, for centuries. But which are the oldest?
I recently had the chance to hear some stories that were once widely known, but were either too obscure for most people to hear, or were too old for many to remember. This includes ""The Fox and the Hound"" by Roald Dahl, ""The Three Bears"" by Robert Brautigan, and ""The Fox and the Grapes"" by Louis Sachar. I was particularly interested in hearing these stories because of their common theme of animal versus human relationships.
I was also intrigued by the fact that all of the stories I heard, even though they came from nearly 100 years ago, are timeless. Even if you know the story, you can't help but be surprised every time you hear it, because the human beings who created and read these stories no longer exist. What they created was not a pastiche of myths and legends, but rather a new language. Each story was its own language, written in a style that was both beautiful and timeless, for people who had lived through that world.
What is so striking about these stories is that many of the ideas that they convey are still relevant today. We may think of the stories in terms of an anthrop"

This is a film that takes its name from a magical act, so it's not only a film of wizards, but of wizards performing the most horrific magic conceivable."" The film was also selected as one of the best films of 1998 by the Los Angeles Times. The film received positive reviews from critics, with a 99% approval rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.
The film had its world premiere on September 9, 1998, at the Newport Beach Film Festival. It went on to be screened at over 40 other film festivals before going wide on November 9, 1998. It would also be released in most of Europe, the UK, Ireland, and Australia, where it received good to great reviews for the time. It became a cult favorite,"
1,"pirates The official Twitter account of the Toronto Blue Jays just tweeted a photo of a ‘pirate’ costume the team will wear in a coming game. The team’s Twitter account has since deleted the image.
We haven’t confirmed the identity of the costume or which game it will be worn at, but we’ll update the post if we learn more.
The tweet appears to be part of an on-going promotion for the Toronto Blue Jays. The team has been running a Twitter game, #RedOrBlueChallenge, where it asks people to share photos of themselves dressed up in blue or red, or both, and they in turn tweet photos of themselves dressed up in similar attire.
It’s also not the first time the Toronto Blue Jays have worn pirate costumes. The team previously donned the costume for a 2012 tweet promoting the team’s upcoming season opener.
As part of that same promotion, Blue Jays players also dressed up as pirates for an event at the team’s Spring Training facility in Dunedin, Florida.
We’ll keep you posted if we find out which game the team will wear the pirate costumes.
Update: The Toronto Blue Jays have revealed that they will be wearing the ‘pirate’ costumes in a series against the New York Yankees on June 13 and 14. It’s not clear if there will be a third game.

1,"dragons The dragons are said to have descended from the skies to protect mankind, who could never fend them off alone. Their fiery breath is a deadly and terrible thing.
The dragons are powerful and they always want to rule the world. That is why, in the dragon's lair, there are a whole lot of gold and silver, so that they can do whatever they want without any problem.
The most amazing thing about the dragons is that they are the only animal in the world that has its own name. When you think of dragons, you can't think of the same as you used to. They have changed so much that we can't even recognize them anymore. But we have to respect and fear them even today, because they are the ones that have always protected our world from evil. They have always been our allies and friends.
As for why I chose the dragon, I have to admit that dragons are very powerful animals. If there are so many of them in the world, why haven't they already taken over the world?
All in all, I hope you like this dragon and I'm sure that this animal is your favourite animal in the whole world. 
  Enjoy this awesome creature that has always stood by your side to protect you from everything that's wrong and evil in the world. 
  Do you like this dragon? Do you think it is a great design? Let me know in the comments below.

1. This section applies to characters who aren't wearing armor or wearing clothing. The character chooses to wear or not wear armor or clothing as part of a character's basic ability. Characters who aren't wearing armor or clothing also have access to the same special features, abilities, and restrictions that apply to characters who do wear armor or clothing, in effect allowing characters who are unarmed to use the same spells and abilities that characters who are wearing armor or clothing do.
2. To gain the benefit of an unarmed combat feature, a character must have one or more of the following:

Wear no armor, choose not to wear clothing, be at least 5th level.
Wear light or medium armor (including leather), choose not to wear clothing, be at least 7th level.
3. While the character is wearing armor or not wearing clothing, the character may not move in a direction different than the chosen direction. The character chooses to move in a chosen direction as part of a character's basic ability.
Characters who aren't wearing armor or clothing have a +2 bonus to their AC (to a maximum of +8), and have disadvantage on saving throws. Additionally, the character's Speed and Jump are reduced by 2 (to a maximum of 4) while wearing light or medium armor or by"
1,"fortresses Fortresses were fortresses that were built and run by the United States Army and Navy during World War II. Built in anticipation of a possible attack on the United States and its allies in the Pacific Northwest by the Imperial Japanese Army, some of the buildings contained special armaments, defensive systems, and other features. Fortresses were also built in anticipation of attack on the United States by Nazi Germany. The first fortress, Fort Lewis, was built by the United States to protect against a Japanese invasion of the Northwest, and was completed in 1940. The fortresses played a crucial role in defending the Pacific Northwest. They contained both permanent positions, and more temporary positions that could be moved to different locations. The buildings were designed with a number of unique features, such as bunkers, defensive positions, and other fortifications.
""Fortress"" is an accurate description for some of the fortresses. These forts and their location in the Pacific Northwest played a critical role in the defense of the Pacific Northwest against invasion and the threat of attack by Japan, Germany, and now, by China. They were built to be the last line of defense in the event of a Japanese or Nazi attack. Their primary purpose was to defend against attack by land (with ground forces) or by sea. The Pacific Northwest, and the U.S. Pacific fleet in particular, was placed under siege. The U.S. Army built a total of ten forts in the Pacific Northwest. The first fortress was Fort"

i don't like all the people who say aliens is an adjective that means ""things that are not from earth"" or ""things from outer space."" i don't like that because the definition of alien is ""an alien is a person from a different country or culture."" ""aliens are something that came from outside."" you can't define something that has a different culture as not being from earth.
so if you want to call a person from a different culture ""alien,"" then that person must be not human. so it's not like the word has been put in the dictionary with a definition that makes people think ""it's a person from another culture.""
there is a big group of kids in my school who say aliens are just people from outer space or from another planet. well, that's what my teacher says. i'm sorry i don't believe aliens come from outer space. i'm sorry if that makes me an alien hater. aliens are weird but they are people too.
the last thing i'll tell you about aliens is that there are many different kinds of aliens. aliens are everywhere. the things they do aren't the things you do. so it's like they are aliens but they are so much more than that. that's why they can't be your ""alien enemy."" aliens can't be your enemy. you can't hate them. there is"

Galaxy Laniakea (abbreviated GALLA) is an elliptical galaxy approximately 2 million light-years away in the constellation Lepus, the leprechaun. This galaxy is well known because it is a spiral galaxy, with a bright nucleus and a multitude of jets of hot and charged gas spewing from its nucleus and forming filaments and clumps of material in the direction of the galaxy's rotation. It was first discovered by William Herschel in 1790 and is one of the most recognizable examples of an elliptical galaxy. GALLA has several large galactic nebulas in its nucleus, the most prominent being the giant cluster IC 1522. This large cluster is composed of a multitude of smaller galaxi, including NGC 6262 and NGC 6734. As a result of its proximity to a galaxy cluster, GALLA also contains numerous galactic nebulas.
Galaxy Laniakea is the sixth most luminous spiral galaxy in the southern constellation Lepus. GALLA has a visible-light magnitude of 5.9. According to its distance from Earth, it is approximately 200 million light-years away in the southern sky. The apparent magnitude of the nucleus varies with the position of the observer; in the constellation of Lepus it is seen at magnitude +8.0 with 10 degrees of arc. In its"

This week we have two very special guests. My good friend and fellow CNC machinist and engineer Paul Hildreth. He is currently a software engineer at a leading technology company but he's most well known for being one of the first CNC machinists and machinist educators. We are both very proud to be representing the CNC machinist community in our guest posts for this column. He's also the author of Machinists: The Definitive Guide To CNC Machining and a series of other books on the subject and we're going to learn how to run a machine from him.

1,"survivors Survivor (and its variants) is a British television drama created by Jon Foskett and based on his novel of the same name. The series, which aired on ITV from 20 February 2000 to 7 February 2001, was an adaptation of Foskett's first novel of the same name, originally published in 1990. A second adaptation, titled ""The Body"", premiered in October 2004.  It was also later made into a feature film titled ""The Body"", which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008.  In the US, the first series was made available on Netflix.  A feature-length version titled ""The Body"" was also released in the UK in May 2008. In both the UK and US feature films, the original music score is composed by Brian Tyler.  The series focuses on a group of individuals trying to cope with a sudden and mysterious death.  A central plot point of the series involves the group's attempts to figure out who is responsible for the murder of one of their number.

A total of eight episodes were made for the first series, and the total episodes for the second series was eight, made from 30 July to 9 September 2001.  The characters of the lead characters were also expanded upon in the two series.  The cast of the series is made up of three major actors - Michael Sheen as Jon Finch, Martin Shaw as Mark Williams and Tom Cullen as Tom Hardy.

1,"warriors It was a typical Friday night out on the town for the Sacramento Kings, who were gearing up to play in the NBA Finals. That is, until an earthquake triggered a massive avalanche and forced the team to abandon their flight home.
Hours after the 6.4-magnitude quake struck at around 1:30 a.m. PT, the team posted a Facebook video showing them all standing on the tarmac and preparing to take off. That's when a huge swath of ice broke through the roof of the airport.
""It just lifted the entire plane off the ground,"" team publicist Matt Matthews tells The Salt Lake Tribune. ""They started trying to slide down the ramp, but they couldn't make it because the plane had lifted off the runway.""
In the video, there are no immediate indications the team suffered any injuries. However, some of the players ended up stranded outside the airport while others were evacuated to safety.
The Kings eventually got a flight home that arrived in Sacramento at around 4 a.m. Saturday.
While an earthquake will usually generate snow and ice in the Northern Rockies, these Kings had ice on their flight.
""You hear about stuff like this in the Bay Area and LA, but to see it happen in Sacramento is crazy,"" Matthews says. ""But we're lucky. It could've been a lot worse.""
The Kings won't get another crack at playing in the Finals, but a trip to the second round is still possible."

The game pits two different civilizations against one another over time, with the players choosing from two races per game. It consists of a timeline of events and campaigns set over a number of years.
In the game the player takes the role of a civilization in the ancient era. As the story moves forward through time, their civilization advances technologically. At some point, however, the player's civilization faces a challenge from a rival civilization. The player must battle their way to the top, leading their civilization to victory. The game uses dice rolls to determine success. 
Civilization: War for the Planet of the Apes was originally released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. On 5 October 2015, the game received an update for Android devices that added compatibility for the Xbox 360, bringing the total supported mobile platforms to six. 
The game received ""M"" rating in the European Union for blood, violence, and crude content. The game was nominated for the RPG.com Game of the Year in 2012, and was a runner-up in the 2011 RPG.com Award for Best Game. In 2014, the game was awarded the Roleplaying Game of the Year Award by the ""International Guild of Game Journalists"".

1,"empires The three kingdoms of Ancient China, known as ""southern"" or ""emperor"" states, were the Ming (1368–1644), Qing (1644–1911), and Qingxi (1644–1911) empires, which ruled much of China during the Ming, Qing and Qingxi Dynasties. 
The Ming Empire was founded by Ming Emperor Yongle and ended with the Qing Dynasty. The Qing Empire was founded by Ming Emperor Gaozong and ended with the Qing Dynasty. The Qingxi Empire was the fourth and youngest of the three Chinese dynasties. It was founded by Ming Emperor Xuanwu in 1571 and ended with the Chinese Republic in 1911.
The Ming, Qing, and Qingxi empires were all characterized by a centralized, central government in Beijing. The Chinese civil code, the Manchu Code (明后六典), came out of these monarchies and was the basis for the system of government. The Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history is known for its military successes. One of the most famous military victories of the Three Kingdoms was the battle of Nanjing in 1368. This battle resulted in the fall of the Ming Dynasty and the foundation of the Qing Dynasty.

This week I realized that this name has also been used for one of the most iconic planeswalkers in the Magic universe, Gavony Township.
Gavony Township is the name used for a giant red dragon, which is also how Gavony Township is known in the physical world. This is pretty amazing for a name, as it was only a few years ago that Gavony Township was just known in ""the real world"" for its role in the Magic the Gathering world.
Gavony Township's role in the Magic world is actually not just in the planeswalker deck ""Gavony Township."" I had a chance to interview Jace Beleren (from the most recent set, Shadows over Innistrad) in late 2009, and it's something I remember really well.

1,"detectives On this week's episode of “Dirty John,” the true crime-inspired podcast, the former couple, Frank and Debra, who lived the story in front of us, is getting the close-up treatment for the first time since their separation in 2015.
In the “Inside the Episode” article, host Johnahan talks to a psychiatrist and a relationship therapist, as well as Debra’s brother, about what makes people keep getting involved with these kinds of personalities. And Frank’s sister, Mary Jane, who was a frequent visitor to the house, talks about her brother and Debra’s relationship in depth, and why she doesn’t regret any of the choices she made at the time.
Frank and Debra’s relationship story was covered extensively by The New York Times, which spoke to Frank’s friends and family, as well as a psychiatrist who treated him for years, about his personality and his relationship with Debra. But as the podcast reveals, Frank’s friends and family also described him as a manipulative man.
He is described as manipulative in the text of the memoir by Debra (which you can read on The New York Times’ website), and this is borne out throughout the show. At one point, Frank’s sister describes her brother as an “assistant of one type or another” to all his girlfriends, including Debra. The fact"
1,"criminals How do you stop a criminal?
In most places (US excepted), the answer is not to stop the criminal but to arrest him, put him in jail.
This is a bit unusual because most of the people who write crime-fighting books tend to promote the ""stop and frisk"" option because they claim that it is a way to prevent many crimes.
But, if we look at the data, we see that most shootings (of the civilian kind) that occur in cities are done by people already known to police or, as a result of prior police dealings with them.
This means that we have already solved at least part of the problem by simply arresting these suspects. It doesn't mean that we should not seek to solve the rest.
It also means that criminals already know that they can kill or maim, and go about doing so.
One possible reason is that it becomes very expensive to arrest all those who commit crimes and then put them in jail when they will not be put back out on the streets because of the cost.
So, as we've seen, arresting suspects may help in some ways, but not in others. 
So, now we come to the issue of reducing the crime rate.
Now, crime rates have tended to drop over the years (although for some categories, like violent crime, it is still high). We also see crime rates going up in some places. So, in some areas, it looks like crime"

1. A bloodsucker is a human with a blood type that attracts others into drinking their blood. This can be a curse or blessing, depending on how it's used.
2. The act of sucking the blood of another is called blood-drinking. While not all vampires are blood-suckers (this is a secondary quality of their nature), it's an important distinction.
3. A blood-drinker is someone who consumes the blood of others (whether they are aware of this or not). This usually causes them to become insane (or at least insane enough) to satisfy their hunger.
4. Blood-sucking is used to denote human beings that are attracted to human blood.
5. Blood-drinking is used to denote vampires. Note that blood-drinking does not necessarily involve a bite (though sometimes it does, depending on the situation).
6. In the Harry Potter series, vampires are referred to as ""bloodsuckers"" or ""blood-drinkers.""
7. There are many definitions and connotations that vampire fiction can take. In particular, it's important to differentiate between the vampire and the bloodsucker.

1,"angels The Angels were one of the teams involved in the ""New York City Subway System for the Public Transport of the City of New York"" project of the New York City Subway, which was to be a free, underground train system. The project was to be a collaboration between the New York City Transit Authority, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city government, and would have provided access to subways from the rest of the transit system's lines in the city of New York. On July 22, 1883, the Angels were granted a $300,000 grant from the city for their portion of the project and in 1888 the Angels and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) agreed to develop a tunnel from the Madison Square Garden (MSG) and Yankee Stadium (YS) subway stations down to the waterfront.
Due to a lack of capital and a lack of progress on the project, however, the Angels withdrew in 1891. Their portion of the tunnel was completed, but the tunnel itself was not used by the public. The MTA began to operate it in 1901.
In October 1891, a large crowd of the public had begun to crowd around the tunnel. After a short time, officials closed the tunnel to the public. In response, a strike was begun and the tunnel was reopened to the public after three weeks. In 1902, a third tunnel was built to connect the other two parts of the tunnel and to link the tunnel up to the Williamsburg Bridge, also under construction at"
1,"demons they are spirits that roam the earth. in the olden days, their existence was a mystery, but they were often associated with witchcraft.
an old witch's curse can be traced back to a devil's temptation to lead someone into temptation and destruction. in a witch's curse, the devil tempts the person to do an act that causes the person to sin. this could be anything from giving the devil the last slice of pizza, or telling the truth to your best friend.
in many ways, witches were real. they were real people who did the things the people in this book did. they were real people who cursed people, and they were real people who were tricked into doing things that they shouldn't have done.
even if it was all just a trick of the devil to lure you into sin, if you believed that, you could go to hell, because you were wrong. the bible says that god doesn't allow people to go to hell for bad deeds; he accepts people who repent.

1,"superheroes I've always thought of the idea of a ""superhero"" as a kind of superhero as opposed to a normal human person. It's funny that when people refer to themselves as ""a superhero"" or describe their powers, they almost never mention any superpowers that might be ""normal"" to the average person. I never knew that these fictional superheroes had such unique abilities. I thought they had all the abilities that any person would have!
I just looked up the Wikipedia definition of a superhero. I thought it was interesting how the word ""superhero"" isn't mentioned in the article. I've always thought that it was used to describe characters that were super-powered and strong. It also mentioned that these characters usually wear costumes. It's always been used to describe these characters that have superpowers. It didn't mention anything about wearing a costume. It just described them as the superheroes in its title.
Wikipedia said that the first super heroes in America weren't created as a ""celebrity craze"". They had powers like flying, strong, and superhuman strength. The first super heroes didn't wear capes, though. They wore tights to hide their powers. They were very ordinary people who had extraordinary abilities. They were the people who had ""superpower powers"". The Wikipedia article says they became known as superheroes by 1938! That makes them ""very early superheroes"". This would be really amazing if they had superpowers that were discovered accidentally.

but, in some ways  our dreams about our past is nothing new, we all dream about our future but how often do we think about our past?  we think about our future but rarely about our past.
i've heard that a person who is really thinking about his past is really thinking about his present, his present is really hard and he can't get through it unless he takes a break and think about his past.  for instance, i have dreamt about my past several times in the last weeks.  and if it's a good or a bad dream  i still want to think about it and think about it and think about it...

2,"secrets I want to learn some advanced magic tricks. It's time to turn up the heat and get a head start on Halloween. 
There's nothing worse than being left to wonder what's going to happen next, so let's get straight to the chase and find out how to create your very own witchcraft. This isn't one of those ""here's 10 easy spells to do at home"" things. I've taken a lot of care to make these tricks extremely challenging and hard to perform, but I've kept things simple enough that even beginners can do them. 
I use modern materials to help you make these potions, but I've never used any actual magic ingredients. No real magic spells were cast for this book. Even if they were, you probably wouldn't be able to find the ingredients to make them. I recommend sticking with modern and readily available options.
The ingredients I use all have a specific purpose, but are not necessarily tied to magic. If you're looking to make things for practical reasons, these might be out of the question for you. If not, you can find instructions for making these potions in the book. 
If you do use the potions, keep in mind that magic potions can be deadly to consume. If you've got any kind of allergic reaction, don't drink it. It's also dangerous to consume the powder in the book. That's why I put it in a pouch, so you can only get a little at a time. If"

2,"treasures The best thing about the National Trust for Scotland’s newest property, the Kintore Castle Hotel, is that the hotel is more than a place to stay overnight. It’s the future of Kintore.
The Kintore Castle Hotel is the first project to be launched as part of the National Trust for Scotland’s £100m Kintore Landscape Partnership. The trust’s £1m fund will go towards creating an outstanding destination that will transform Kintore.
The hotel was created from the original castle and is designed to be as authentic as possible. It was built on the site that used to be a granary, and contains original features such as a timber floor and the stone fireplaces. There are also more recent additions, including a restaurant, a bar and some modern rooms. But these are designed to look like the original building, or at least a little bit like it.
There are a number of unusual structures scattered around the gardens, including a timber gable that has a secret entrance built into it. The gable was originally used by the castle’s owner as a meeting place, but in 1772 became the home of local doctor, William Dunlop.
While the buildings may be older than the garden, they’re not the oldest thing in the gardens. That honour belongs to the tree fern. Some tree ferns have been growing at Kintore for hundreds of years,"

If your entire unit gets killed, all of your units are lost until you respawn them (they will come back the next turn; the rules for that are a little different)

2,"monsters Lore
The first humans encountered the Naga were Naga-infested ships fleeing the Great Fire, which occurred some 3,000 years ago. The fire, which was caused by an Naga's magic, destroyed the village of Yshmael. The survivors fled north to the area now known as Tengrinbode, where they eventually founded the world of Tengrinbode. Over the course of many generations, the Naga took control of the region, forcing the survivors to fight to survive, while the Naga enjoyed life in the newly established land. The Great Fire that caused the destruction of Yshmael was caused by a Naga's magic and caused the region's entire population to be cursed with death in less than an hour. The Naga then turned against the survivors and began to enslave them in an effort to preserve their power. After centuries of constant warfare, the survivors eventually began to build great cities in the mountains, but the Naga eventually attacked the city of Sartar, where the only person left alive was a young woman. The Naga enslaved her in an effort to keep the race from being destroyed and created many children in an attempt to maintain their power, but soon learned that the young woman's children were more than enough to take over the world. The Naga created numerous cities and took control of the planet, but their power diminished with each new generation. Eventually, the people of the world developed many technological advances,"
2,"heroes heroes is the first studio album from British musician and singer-songwriter David Bowie. It was released in April 1970 on RCA Victor, a subsidiary of RCA Records.
As with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, Heroes was recorded at Abbey Road Studios. It was released to a generally positive response, although critics were largely divided, with some finding the music to be innovative but lacking in creativity, while others were critical of its use of a variety of vocal styles. It spawned two UK hit singles: ""Let's Dance"" (number three) and ""Starman"" (number four), and is widely recognised as Bowie's best-known debut album. It was later reissued in 2013 by RCA Victor, a three-CD box set. In 2013 Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was honoured as one of the Top 100 Greatest Rock Singers of all-time by the Guinness Book of Records.
Bowie had begun recording in early April 1970. ""I got into it because of the process,"" said Bowie in 1993. ""I wanted to work with someone I trusted, someone who could tell me what to do, and I'd heard of David, so I thought, 'Right, I'll go over there.' I wasn't expecting that, I just thought we'd do a bit of what we normally do."" Despite this, a week of recording in May had Bowie leaving the studio"

2,"kingdoms The Kingdom of Edessa was located in Asia Minor, in what is now the eastern region of Turkey. It was an important military province in the late Roman Empire and was conquered by the Seleucid Empire in the 3rd century BC. It was a major trading centre for gold, and was conquered by the Parthian Empire in the 2nd century BC, then reconquered by Rome again in the 1st century BC. It was conquered by the Byzantine Empire in the 3rd century AD, and then by the Sasanian Empire in the 4th century AD. In the 5th and 6th centuries AD, it was annexed to the Roman Empire, which lost it to the Arabs in the early 7th century. It was an important Byzantine naval base, and was captured by the Byzantines in 687. Edessa then became an Arab imperial fiefdom, and the last Roman administrative and military outpost in Asia Minor. It was eventually incorporated into the Abbasid Caliphate, which then transferred it to the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate after 711. Its last rulers were Umar, and Abbas ibn al-Hakim. The region suffered significant military defeats in the first Muslim–Roman wars in the 8th century, and was recaptured by the Arabs in the early 10th century. Edessa remained within the Byzantine Empire and later became a fief of the Arabs, whose first ruler of Edessa was Muhafiz ibn Mihrit."

2,"voyages The Voyages and Discoveries of Christopher Columbus is a 1616 book written by Christopher Columbus. It is an account of his voyages from 1492 onwards. It is believed that Columbus had written a similar account as a journal in 1493, but this had never been recorded.
In it, Columbus recorded many of his voyages and discoveries in order to show his accomplishments to future explorers, and to give credit to all of those who had helped him. Although some were skeptical, it was soon accepted as fact and became a cornerstone of history, due in part to his book and the films based on it. It was reprinted in 1857.
The Voyages and Discoveries of Christopher Columbus is the first book by Columbus to use a Latin language title. The Latin title was from  (De rerum natura et historia, or ""On the Nature and History of the World"") from the First Book of Euclid, written around 250 BC. The English title is from the  by Christopher Marlowe, ""The Adventures and Discoveries of Christopher Columbus.""
This account, along with his  The History of the Indies, and the account of his discovery of America in the, was later published in.

2,"beasts There has been a lot of talk about how to improve the AI for beasts, which is certainly necessary as they don't feel like a real part of the game, and a lot of people do have a problem with them. The purpose of this answer is to explain what I mean by AI. When I use the term beast I generally mean anything which has more than basic ""move"" or ""attack"" properties that can be controlled with keys. It may not feel very natural, but you are controlling it (or a piece which acts similarly) and it has its own priorities, is driven by its own needs, and responds to you as a person. The Beast AI is set up to deal with situations in a way that makes sense to the beast. This is important because a beast is not a human playing as a beast and it doesn't care how it ends up doing on the scoreboard. It just wants to behave like a beast. In other words, this is what I mean when I say that the Beast AI is ""unobvious"". This is because it is designed to work on its own strengths, not to have all of the tools at its disposal to do something which it isn't built to do. The Beast AI, however, should be fairly obvious in what the goals of the beast should be, what kind of choices it should be making (and how it should choose between competing options), and how it should be reacting to the decisions that are being made around it.

Hawaii's northernmost island, Maui, lies to the north of Oahu, but is not part of the Hawaii group. Oahu is the largest island, located to the south and south-southwest, and is separated from the main island by the Lanai (pronounced /luh-nee/; Hawaiian, meaning ""little isle"") chain to the north. To the north are two other main islands: Kahoolawe to the west and Lanai to the east. The largest island, Oahu, is the most densely populated, and Honolulu is the capital and largest city. The entire group comprises 786,000 ha (1.8 mi²; 3.4 km²) in total. There are 19 inhabited islands and atolls in the group. Many Hawaiian legends and myths state that the islands were created from the ocean by the gods, who cast the first stone. It is believed that the Hawaiian archipelago originated from volcanic activity which resulted in the formation of the largest known island group in the Pacific Ocean (the Hawaiian Islands are also referred to as ""The Big Island"" and ""The Island of Hawaii""). The population of the group is approximately one million people.

2,"challenges I was pleased with my own performance, but also very much looking forward to the challenge ahead. Having spent last winter in the United States, I’d grown to appreciate a large and diverse array of fresh, healthy food at restaurants, but I’d been missing the wide variety of high-quality, prepared food offered in some of the less developed parts of Africa. 
My first meal was delicious. I ordered a bowl of spinach, rice, and vegetables, which was very good, but I would have enjoyed a bit more variety. I also had a glass of very good wine, which I savored with my meal. The restaurant was located in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood, and everything about it was charming and relaxing.
After two days of very good food, I was ready for a change. I asked to see a list of healthy options, and was pleased to see that my choices included salad, soup, and yogurt, all very healthy choices for me.

After a two-hour drive, we arrived in the next town, and our mission was successful. We found a very interesting bakery and grocery store. The owner was very friendly and helpful, and explained to me about his food policies and healthy choices. I ordered a smoothie and also enjoyed a cup of coffee.

2,"fables Fables (fāb(ə)r-s(ə)s) (from Greek fable, ""tale"", Latin fableta, ""fable"") are short, narrative, usually allegorical, fictional stories intended to teach a moral. The fable often takes a realistic setting to illustrate moral truths in a moralistic manner. An allegory is a story that attempts to convey a moral lesson by drawing parallels with a physical or natural phenomenon to demonstrate an underlying moral truth. In fable, the subject of the tale may take the form of a man, a beast, a plant, a God, a moral, a relationship, a law, or an event. Each fable tells a story of virtue and vice, of good and evil, of light and darkness, or of wisdom and folly.
These short tales from Ancient Greek and Roman mythology and other cultures have a special place in many religions, and have appeared in different guises in a variety of other cultures. A fable is not really fiction because it is told from the point of view of a character in the story, rather than being a first-person account, or based on a literal fact. A fable is not only an allegory, it also may be a parable. A parable is an allegory, but not strictly speaking a fable.
A fable might have a moral or a teaching story, or it could be a fairy tale, telling of the plight"
2,"guardians We were playing in a casual match when two Guardians, as well as their teammates, appeared out of thin air and attacked our team in no time. One Guardian was so strong that I was stuck behind its shield, the other Guardian was too weak to do anything at all. We had no good weapons to deal with this Guardian, but our best chance to win was to defeat the other two Guardians before one of them kills us all. In the end, we succeeded. That was when I realized that Guardians don’t have to wear any armor to be strong. It was just like one of my friends had brought all these Guardians into the game. That’s how it is in the real world too. There are many people who can bring Guardians into the battle. Some people are more powerful than others, but I would say that you can have a chance to defeat Guardian too. That was my experience in the game. I hope to share more interesting stories like this in the future.

2,"sorcerers These mysterious and powerful wizards, as well as their secret societies, play a major role in The Lord of the Rings. Not only are they the only wizarding race capable of bending nature to their will, they also wield the power of the Ring.
As you might have guessed, they're the only wizarding race in Middle-Earth that's also human. In The Lord of the Rings, wizards are humans, elves, or, if it's the Second Age, dwarves, but that doesn't mean they're the same ones as in Harry Potter.
Here are a few different sorts of wizards in Middle-Earth:

Sorcerers are the only wizards in Middle-Earth capable of casting a spell.
Mortals can use sorcery in some cases, but it has to be learned through years of training. You can read more about this here.
The most common type of sorcerer in Middle-Earth is the elven sorcerer. They usually prefer magic as a means of defense rather than for offense. These men use their magical ability to defend themselves from harm, or attack others who have done harm.
Elves are also known as the ""wanderers of the mist,"" or ""wise folk."" These elf races are capable of both offense and defense. One can read more about this in the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King book.
Elves live a quiet, peaceful life in Middle-Earth. While it is possible for them to turn against"

2,"dragons dragons  It’s a classic children’s fantasy tale with a unique twist – dragons are a way of life for the Merfolk. Their culture values the ability to summon and control the mighty beasts and they have used their magic in ways that include healing, creation and defense. The dragon’s unique body shape is reminiscent of a mermaid’s and in modern stories, their ability to breathe fire and use their long tongue has been harnessed for other means as well. From medieval knights to science fiction writers, dragons have fascinated us since they appeared in story.
The merfolk are a clever and resilient culture that has embraced the dragon. There is no denying that the Merfolk are an unusual, magical people.

The fortress is located on the top of a hill, at the crossroad of the main roads north, south and east of the Maghreb. The fortress was built to control the surrounding territory and the ports of the Mediterranean, as well as the Berber tribes living in the area. The fortress was a major Berber stronghold during the Middle Ages, and has preserved its historical and architectural characteristics from that time. In the fourteenth century, the fortress passed into the hands of the Ottoman Empire, and was used by the Ottoman sultans of Tunis for various purposes, until it was destroyed by a French bombardment in 1877. In the nineteenth century the castle was rehabilitated, and today the castle is open to the public, while its fortifications are still considered to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Lithographs were once popular and widely used for advertising and business cards.
Lithograph prints can be bought cheaply at art supply stores.

2,"galaxies The vast majority of the galaxies in the observable universe reside in the constellation Cassiopeia, and the vast majority of these contain stars within their nuclei. While some have more massive stars and others are composed entirely of empty space, all have nuclei, and these nuclei have an incredible amount of information waiting to be extracted.
Stars are formed as material from the cores of giant molecular clouds condenses and clumps together, forming stars, neutron stars, and even black holes. These clumps grow into massive galaxies like ours. As the clumps become large, the gravity of their star fields pulls on each other, forming new stars in the process. These galaxies expand as they gather material and interact with other galaxies and the Milky Way, forming new stars at an even faster rate.
As their central black holes spit out material onto our galaxy, spiral galaxies continue expanding at this exponential rate and eventually reach a critical mass, where the galaxies can no longer hold on to their star formation. In these galaxies, they begin to collapse into ""cosmic cores"" in which the galaxy's dark matter is pulled out into the centers.
When two galaxies collide, they pull out stars from their nuclei, either to form new stars or to add to their already large numbers.
It's at these ""collisions"" that we've found the most massive galaxies that have ever existed. These collisions release a tremendous amount of energy, and the two galaxies that collide are the most massive objects"
2,"robots 2,000:000:000 - This one has a bit of history. In the 90s when the web was really taking off, a guy named Bruce T. Lee took the idea of a robotic interface and pushed it to its limit. The result was an extremely advanced interface that would take over the control of a car from the driver. It was a huge step in terms of safety and convenience. He was able to create the interface through a computer on the dash, which he would then instruct to take over the car with commands. However, it all came to a halt when the government shut down the internet. I guess Lee's patent was invalidated... which means that other people are going to be able to put together interfaces similar to his, or just make their own. It would take years before such a system was made available commercially to the public but I still think that it might have been worth it.

The team was founded in 1968 and is a founding member of the NBA West Division. The Warriors are considered to be one of the most successful NBA franchises of the last forty years, having won five NBA championships (1969, 1971, 1973, 1994, and 2015) and eleven NBA Finals games (1971, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1990, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2015, and 2017). Along with being one of the three most successful NBA franchises of the 20th century, the Warriors have also made the playoffs in 30 consecutive seasons. Along with the Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls, Golden State is one of only three teams in NBA history with a playoff record over.700 in consecutive seasons (the others being the Boston Celtics (1990–1997) and Los Angeles Lakers (1978–1988)).
""Warriors"" also refers to the team's home arena, ORACLE Arena. In November 2014, ORACLE Arena had its third naming rights partner. This was the first time Oracle Arena did not have a naming rights partner.
The Warriors have won numerous NBA championships, most recently in 2017.

2,"explorers Explanation of the ""Mermaids"" Explorer patch for World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.
In the years since the Burning Crusade, new content has come in the form of expansions such as Wrath of the Lich King and Warlords of Draenor. With the release of the third expansion, Shadowlands, these patches are no longer relevant to the game as it was played. Since no one has officially updated the game, we made an unofficial patch for the expansion.
The patch does not affect the original game; it merely adds new content, similar to how the expansion content is added.
The patch's primary content is the set of 10 patches called the ""Mermaids"". These patches revolve around the theme of mermaids and can be read individually, or in a storyline context with the other patches. The patches can also be played in the order they were released, without much in the way of game mechanics being changed.
The patch includes content from the following expansion sets:

Mermaids of draenor
Mermaids of stormheim
Mermaids of northrend
Mermaids of maelstrom
Mermaids of southmorang
Mermaids of the underbelly
Mermaids of the undying sea

While the patches do not contain any new content, there are some cosmetic changes made in the patch itself.

2,"civilizations The first major human-civilization in the Americas was the Maya in what is now the Yucatan Peninsula. Other significant civilizations in the Americas are: the Aztecs in the Mexican highlands, the Maya, Toltec, Zapotec, Incan, Quiche, and pre-Columbian Spanish civilizations.

Maya civilization was an ancient civilization in what is now Guatemala, the western Caribbean, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. The Maya developed their civilization during the 4th millennium BC, and their civilization collapsed in the late 900s. Maya civilization reached its peak during the 1st millennium BC, but this was probably the only peak as the civilization suffered from an ecological crisis, followed by civil wars during the 9th century that resulted in massive destruction of most of the cities.

The pre-Columbian Incan civilization, which thrived from the 6th to the 14th centuries, is an extremely complex civilization in the Americas and the pre-eminent civilization of the Inca Empire. Other notable pre-Columbian civilizations include: the Maya (in the Yucatán peninsula and in Central America), the Aztec, Toltec, Zapotec, and pre-Columbian Spanish civilizations, and the Inca.

2,"empires Slavery was a fact of life in Roman Britain, but was illegal in the Roman Empire, and in the Roman Empire proper only in areas of the Roman Republic.  Emperors had a range of powers that in practice were often overlapping. The empire was divided into the ""empires"" of the Praetorian prefects, the ""emperors"" themselves, and the ""emperor provinces"" which extended from the Roman frontier to the sea.  The ""emperors"" themselves were often called ""emperors"". The main feature of the empire was that a Roman soldier was legally considered ""an imperial citizen"". This had been enshrined by Julius Caesar in the Roman Law of September 7, 43 BC, which later gave legal effect to the First Punic War. The Second Punic War was fought in the years of Augustus (29 BC to 4AD) and his successors, and it is therefore regarded as part of the first Empire.  At the end of the Second Punic War, Rome had become both the first Empire and the first global empire.  This article uses the term ""emperor"" to refer to a person in this position.  The emperor, being an emperor, was usually referred to as ""Roman emperor"" and ""first Roman emperor"". Emperors were also referred to as ""emperor of Rome"" or ""first Roman emperor"".

The Wizards were the 15th and final team in the Milwaukee Bucks' ""Downtown Express"" of the American Basketball Association (ABBA). They were part of the Bucks' Eastern Conference rivals, the Chicago Bulls. The Bucks changed their name to the ""Milwaukee Bucks"" for the 2001–02 season. The Bulls changed their name to the ""Chicago Bulls"" prior to the 2004–05 season. The Wizards joined the NBA in the 2001–02 season when the Bucks changed leagues. The Wizards had a successful first season in the NBA and made the playoffs for the first time in their first five seasons. In the following years, the Wizards remained competitive, but failed to make the playoffs. As the team's fan base grew and the franchise improved under first-year head coach Rick Adelman, the Wizards began to have success under Adelman and a series of players who contributed to the team's rise to prominence. During the 2004–05 season, with Adelman leading the Wizards back to the playoffs after the franchise's fifth non-playoff season (in six years), a new era of success was begun. After leading the Wizards back to the postseason in 2004–05, Adelman was fired after the Wizards were blown out by the Chicago"
2,"detectives John, it's a detective!

And it has a gun!
I can finally stop watching Criminal Minds!

I need you to find out if this is true or false:

I left my purse at my desk, but it's not missing.

I used to have a job where I had to keep a desk. I did this once. The police thought my desk was missing, but I had actually left it at my desk while I was at work, but they weren't able to catch me in the act. That is a lie!

How do you tell the difference between whether or not I'd given my desk away to someone?Let's look at the context of the statement. First, the sentence includes a location, which might indicate that the desk is missing. If the context didn't mention the location, then the statement would include a word like ""was"", which would not be followed by a location. Second, it includes a verb. Verb verbs in general are a little more difficult to understand because we can't use context to deduce what they imply. However, in this case, the verb is ""used to."" The verb implies a situation in which something was used to something else; in this case, the desk was used to something, and not the other way around. So we can assume that the desk was used to the phone. Finally, the word ""but"" implies that the desk was used to something else"
2,"criminals The National Rifle Association (NRA) has taken a huge hit in fundraising this year as major donors have cut off their contributions in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead.
The NRA's finances have never been a secret, but this year's financial disclosures are different.
Donations from major donors have fallen, with more than $4 million less collected so far this year than last year, according to records obtained by the Miami Herald. As a result, the group has to turn to outside sources to keep the lights on.
That includes a $200,000 loan from the NRA to the Republican Party, the largest amount the party has received from the group in three years.
In the meantime, former NRA president David Keene, who resigned on Friday, is calling for a reorganization of the embattled group that would restructure its operations by cutting out the executive director and putting all of its power in a board of directors that would be elected at gun ranges. The board would then choose a permanent executive director.
""We need to get all these executive leadership positions on the NRA board, which will make everyone whole,"" he said. ""You need a new start.""
Some members of the board want to see significant changes.
""Right now there's no organization in the world that has the same level of accountability that the NRA has,"" board member Wayne LaPierre said. ""We get blamed for everything.""

2,"vampires 1. How do vampires get their powers?

The ability to live without sunlight can only come from a genetic or genetic-like mutation. For some vampires, their mutation was a power gained from drinking vampire blood. Others, however, were born with the mutation.

For the most part, vampires either rely on human blood (and thus lack the need to drink blood) or eat the blood of others, vampires that may not feed off of human blood but can still receive human blood and so, can live off of animal blood and the blood of others who don't know they're vampires.

2. What is it like to be a vampire?

The ability to live without sunlight comes with a range of problems, from feeling sick to the inability to control ones bodily functions.  Because vampires don't control their bodily functions, they can not only go insane, but cause other problems in the community as they drink or become ill. In addition, sunlight kills a vampire. Therefore, one of the most obvious problems is the fact that a vampire's mortality is dependent on sunlight exposure.

Because most humans fear vampires and want to keep them away from their homes and children, vampires typically don't have the freedom they want or need in their life and do what they can to gain more control over themselves. To live a vampire's life, one must be a blood-eater, have the ability to drain the life out of others and drink their blood, or at"
2,"witches There has been a lot of talk recently about female superheroes, especially the ones who aren’t portrayed as blonde, blue eyed, and fit. But why are women, especially women of color, treated differently than men when it comes to superheroes? 
  
Superheroes are men’s characters. So why are women portrayed differently? Why is Scarlet Witch or Ms. Marvel or Black Widow not a main protagonist? Why did Captain America, Hulk or Wolverine not die in the latest Marvel movie? What happens when a black woman wears pants with a skirt for a costume? 
  
This is more about gender than race. But how much difference is a woman wearing a cape and a woman who wears pants and a skirt? 
  
We decided to dig a little deeper to see why women get to choose their own costumes and men don’t. We found out that the most important reason for the difference is financial. 
  
A female superhero would make more money than a male superhero because there’s more money in women. 
  
“Superhero movies are a huge market, and they’re a huge market for girls, for women, for the female consumer,” says Andrew Donahue, founder and CEO of WME. “For most of my life, I’ve been female, and the only superheroes I can remember seeing were male. It’s"

The Devil’s Club is a very well known area of Los Angeles. It's a very rough area; most buildings are torn down and replaced with one-story bungalows or converted strip clubs. Most of the time you're going to meet your end there. 
However, if you know your stuff then it can be a wonderful place to make friends in a completely different way.

The Devil’s Club is full of people who are bored and out of place. They don't have much money and don't have many friends. Some of them are into drugs but most just drink alcohol. The place has a very unique, dirty feel about it; but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You'll find a lot of people who are interesting and not so mainstream as you.

You have to have an idea of what you are looking for. The more you are able to recognize people who are willing to talk to you the better. You'll also find people who are willing to buy drugs from you if you're willing to sell them. This happens more than you think. You'll also find that the people who are willing to sell you drugs are the ones who are most likely to be looking for friends and partners in crime.
There are a lot of people who are willing to talk to you because they love what you're doing and you'll be in good company if you are trying to find a partner."
2,"superheroes Wonder Woman & The Justice League is a video game about the DC Comics universe, created by publisher Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game was released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Windows, Nintendo Switch and iOS. It is the sequel to 2016's Batman: Arkham Knight.
The game is an action role-playing game in which the player can play as the characters Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman, and The Joker as they fight to save Gotham City from being taken over by the villain Ra's Al Ghul. The game's plot focuses on the relationship between Batman and Wonder Woman as the game is played from Batman's perspective. It is the first game in the Batman series to focus entirely on a single character.
While most other games in the series feature characters of other genres, this game has the setting of Gotham City which has been altered by the presence of other super-heroes, with some examples being Superman and Green Lantern. Wonder Woman's appearance in the game was heavily influenced by her comic book counterpart as she was originally seen as being a goddess in the comics, and the developers wanted to feature her as such on the game. The game also features a female Batman and Superman in the form of Barbara Gordon and Jon Kent/Clark Kent.

2,"time-travelers There are two schools of thought when it comes to time travel. The first one says that time travel is possible and it is done by using superstring theory. That is the theory which states that everything has a energy component and that the string theory can be used to calculate the energy that is needed for a wormhole to be made by a certain mathematical process.
I don't know much about this theory but it was suggested by one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, Einstein, the man who predicted, ""the special theory of relativity"". I don't know if you remember the special theory of relativity, but it is one of the most important theories of all time. It is the idea that we are in space, but at the same time in time.
Now, I have to tell you that this theory, if it is true, means that time travel is possible. There is a great chance that time travel is possible, because the universe could have been created in just a few seconds when the first explosion happened in the big bang. Now, time travel does not mean that we have to go to the past but it could be a way of travel to the future.
The second school of thought, the time travelers say that the universe could have been created thousands of years ago because time travel is the only way for me to reach the future. That's why we have this theory that if we can make a wormhole and travel to the future we can also travel back in"

However, I realized when we made the first draft of the story that it would be way too convoluted to turn into a standard RPG, and since it was our first game jam, we needed to decide how exactly to tackle this problem.
We ended up deciding to make a ""light"" RPG with more action, adventure and RPG-y combat than most RPGs and that is what we ended up with. You can see from the above picture how much we simplified the story to fit within the game. I really liked that this game was able to show off a bit of the skill level we had as a team, and that the game had a lot of atmosphere that really came from the setting (we ended up making a whole other song for this soundtrack)!
In addition to that, the game is built on a custom engine written in C++ to power both the graphic engine and the game engine. It"

2,"legends It's time for a new game, so we're back to it! We'll talk about our favorite characters from the last game.
We get to pick some pretty crazy ones, huh? There are a lot of characters in this game that should be a huge disappointment to their fans. There are, for example, characters who should be in this game but aren't.
Who do you hope to see in the game? Who are your favorite characters from the previous game that you're hoping to see in this one? Let us know!

2,"dreams I have very vivid dreams. Sometimes I don't remember them until I wake up, but that's quite rare. I wake up a lot in the middle of the night, often dreaming that I've woken up from my dream. I think that I dream more than I wake up these days, which is a little disconcerting. When I wake up in the morning, I often feel a little tired, especially if I've just woken up after a long restful sleep. One thing I enjoy very much about my dreams is that they're very diverse. I often find myself traveling, but sometimes I find myself in an unfamiliar landscape, like in the ocean.

I once dreamed that there was a long queue of people waiting to visit the library. It seemed to go on and on, and I wondered what they were waiting for, but I was too busy having a great time to notice the queues. Once, I woke up and thought about that dream and tried to work out what it meant. It felt to me that there was more going on in the dream than just a queue of people waiting to go in and out of a building. I had a sort of intuition that the main element was something I was very interested in and I was very curious about. I had to wait until my mother was awake for me to talk about it with her.

The dream also seemed to be about my relationship with my mother. I wondered if they were standing in a queue or"
2,"secrets This is a very fun and creative activity that can be done with any two or more people. I also thought it would be useful in a game of ""Secret Agent"" (like Operation).
This is a simple and fun activity. You will need a few supplies such as paper, pens and tape. Your goal is to write a secret message. For this activity you may use some plain paper with no embellishments on it. You could also use a notebook instead of paper, but make sure it is lined. The pen should also be lined. When you say the secret message, your partner has to find it on the page.
1. Get out some pieces of paper. You may use any pieces of paper you like, but I like the one from the cereal box. This is because the writing is not too big, and the cereal box is more likely to be found lying around than someone's closet.
2. On each piece of paper draw a square on the top left corner of each. The purpose of doing this is to make the person finding the square in the right spot a little lucky.
3. Write the following on each square:

My secret is 
I love you
My secret is out
My secret is in
My secret is on the page
My secret is written in the sky
My secret is in your purse
4. When you are done writing the secret, you can tell your partner, and they will have to find"
2,"journeys Welcome to the online travel journal of John Paul Tisdale (I just can't bear to call him John).
This is an ongoing record of what I hope will be a series of journeys undertaken around the world.
Each entry gives a brief description of the journey, the name of the city or area visited, any highlights and a link to the next entry. Most entries are also accompanied by a photograph and I'll try to make sure that most of these have been taken on a smartphone or camera which takes a reasonable amount of quality pictures.
I'm hoping that this will encourage people to take fewer trips when travelling, but see them as less ""work"" - instead of just going through the motions or because there's nothing else to do. Instead, they will have been planned with a purpose and will be as satisfying as doing work. This is not to say that the first ""work trip"" that I go on will be perfect or that I will always take as good pictures as the ones I'm posting now. It's simply a challenge for me to see if I can improve.
The blog will be in the same format as JohnPaulTravels.blogspot.co.uk, but I will also post some of my images to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Flickr.
The hope is to be able to travel more often and more extensively than I have been able to in the past. That includes taking more photographs and being able to post more detailed and full entries each time"
2,"treasures You've been searching the countryside for years for the mysterious Lost Ark. The Ark is supposedly a magical object containing all the gold in the world. And now you've found it. What do you do with it? Do you keep it, make some fortune, or leave it to those who are worthy to discover it and reap its wonderful rewards? It is up to you. Your decisions and actions will have a lasting effect on the history of the game.
I have played it for 8 years, and I still find myself enthralled with it at least once every 2 weeks, just as I did when I first started playing in 2006. I always have a blast when I do play it!
The game was actually in development for a long time before it finally came out in 2009. Some of the characters were even finished back in 1998. The fact that the game is still very popular shows the amount of talent and creativity behind it. The game has had numerous expansions added to the original version, making it far more complex, but never making it less fun to play.
My husband and I both enjoy playing it together. He's usually the explorer and I'm usually the guard, as it gives me a chance to prove my worth!
If you're thinking of getting into the game yourself, I strongly suggest downloading it and checking it out. You won't be disappointed.
I love this game and I'm glad that you enjoy it as much as I do. I love exploring"

2,"myths In the United States, Americans drink more alcohol than any other country and are at a higher risk of alcohol-related deaths than other people. It is often mistakenly assumed that the more alcohol that a person drinks, the more alcohol they drink and the worse that person will drink. This assumption is true for younger drinkers, but it is false for older drinkers. This myth is based on two studies, which were both published in the 1990s. The studies found an inverse association between drinking frequency and blood-alcohol concentrations: that is, people who drank more alcohol tended to have higher blood-alcohol levels than those who drank less. This study had a short duration and so it cannot be used to gauge the effect of alcohol consumption over time. This study was a retrospective study, meaning that it looked only back at what a person’s blood-alcohol level was at a certain time. They did not take into account how many drinks a person had at any one time. Therefore, this study cannot determine the effect of drinking on a person’s health over time. The second study was a prospective study. This means that the researchers followed people over time and, therefore, could take into account the effects of drinking over time. However, this study did not have enough data to prove that drinking more alcohol leads to more health problems. This is why this study does not disprove the inverse association between drinking and health problems. This myth also relies on two studies published in the 1990s. Both of"
2,"monsters What does it mean to be a monster? What are monsters if not the embodiment of the fears, the weaknesses, and the strengths of humans and monsters? Here are nine great monsters that have been and will continue to be around all of our lives, in every culture, and in every language.
Monsters are always fascinating because they show us how people can take things to the extreme. Here are ten terrifying real-life monsters.
1. Cthulhu
Cthulhu is the most famous of the monster of the deep. While Lovecraft’s Cthulhu is a sea monster of a supernatural sort, the more normal “sea monster” Cthulhu is just as horrific.
Cthulhu is thought to be a result of the mixing of a human soul with a fish-like creature’s body. The result of that fusion is a creature described as having a bloated, tentacled head, with human body parts scattered about it. He is usually portrayed wearing a black robe with red accents.
2. Cthulhu Mythos
This fictional horror is a collection of novels and short stories written by H. P. Lovecraft (1912-1939). The Cthulhu Mythos contains stories that feature the Cthulhu monster, or various aspects of it. In particular, he wrote about creatures known as tentacled ones, and cosmic cosmic-scorpions.

2,"heroes This article is about the South Korean band, Hero, also known as Han Geng and Lee Tae Jin. For other bands from the same genre or other names, see Heroes (band).
Hero is a Korean pop group formed in 2002. They debuted in 2003 with the single ""Who's That?"" and released the second single ""On My Own"" the following year. The group's first extended play ""Honey"" was released in 2005. In 2007, they released their second extended play ""Possum"". After a gap of two years, they released ""Who Is That"". It was the first time that they released 2 studio albums in a row. The group released their third studio album, ""A Way"", on August 18, 2013. It peaked at number one in all major charts.

2,"kingdoms The first recorded appearance of ""Kings"" on a English document was the charter of William Rufus in 1295, to William Fitz-Rufus, which established the rule of Fitz-Rufus as Earl of Westmoreland. The first recorded title of the King of England, however, is given to a king of Mercia in 1299, on the title of ""King of the East Mercians"". The title did not emerge on a national basis until 1292, when Edward I established the title of ""King of England"" following a conflict with Thomas a Becket and the subsequent 1291 Concordat with Pope Eugene IV. As Edward I, King of England, became increasingly unpopular, by 1301 he had lost the support of his own nobility. He then sought the support of the French King, and the King of France proclaimed himself ""King of England"" and ""King of all England"" in a document called the Armagnac Treaty. With the defeat of the English in France and the occupation of Paris in May 1301, this proclamation effectively ended English pretensions to the title of ""King of England"". The title of the king of England did not become an official one until Edward II's reign. Edward II's reign was also notable for the introduction of the Tudor standard, which took the form of a large Tudor rose, surmounted by a Tudor cross. During the reign of Henry VII the coronation of a reigning monarch took place using the title"

I'd just walked in when I saw a young woman with a long black trench coat, black leather gloves and a black mask. She stood there, right in front of me, not moving. There was no doubt that it was the ghost of the girl that I'd seen when I was alone on the bridge a year earlier. She looked at me, she smiled, and then she began to walk away.""

2,"voyages On January 5, 1810, British explorer Captain James Cook, sailing the Endeavour, arrived in New Zealand’s Bay of Islands, after an eight-month voyage from England. Cook’s crew named the land New Zealand after the explorer’s father, John Cook. The discovery of New Zealand transformed New Zealand and the rest of the world, changing the course of British colonial expansion and the development of modern science.
The Endeavour was carrying more than 2,000 pounds of silver. Today, New Zealand’s Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa has a replica of this cargo of silver that has been in the museum since 1811.
Cook and his crew were searching for a passage to the Pacific Ocean when they discovered the Bay of Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. They named the land New Zealand after the explorers’ father, who also sailed in New Zealand. The discovery of New Zealand transformed New Zealand and the rest of the world, changing the course of British colonial expansion and the development of modern science.
The silver had been carried in a chest buried on board the ship. In 1811, Captain Cook buried the chest in the nearby town of Wellington, New Zealand. It was discovered by two local men, Joseph Buller, an explorer and farmer, and Thomas Sturdee, a farmer. It was exhumed in 1914 by Professor Thomas Bruce of the University of Otago, who found the chest had been looted"
2,"curses This section describes the basic aspects of curses.
The curses command line utility makes it easy to execute commands, including those that execute programs. This utility can be run over the top of any other command, or as the only command on the command line; a file can be specified as an input stream, so that commands issued on the file will be sent to all other processes on the machine. The curses command set provides an extensive set of command-line and user-level operations that can be specified as input streams.
curses is a Unix utility, which means that it is written in the C programming language. The curses package also includes the Xlib library, which makes it possible to do graphical applications with curses.
The curses C language bindings are part of the C++98 and C++11 standard libraries and are available from the command line via the curses utility.
The Xlib library is part of the Xlib package, which is included with the GNU system. If you don't have a complete system available, the curses package should also include the Xlib package.
The curses C interface is defined in the Xlib library documentation.
X11 is a set of libraries for creating graphical user interfaces on Unix systems. It was developed by the Xerox Corporation, which also developed Unix and designed it to be a graphical operating system. It is now maintained by Red Hat, Inc.
You can download and install the latest version of Xlib, version 1.4."

2,"beasts Beast Mode: You've heard of an animal being ferocious, but what about a beast? 
  
 In Greek mythology, a monster (often a beast) is a mythical creature, generally depicted as a man-sized monster who often terrorized people. The word ""beast"" has come to have the sense of ""fierce"", usually ""fierce as a lion,"" or ""majestic."" In ancient times, the Roman historian Livy reported that these monsters were called metamorphoses, although the Greek word was omegaleion. The word metamorphoses may derive from omegale, meaning ""changeable"", and ""moirai"", meaning ""beasts"" or ""monsters"", or it may derive from the verb metamorphy, meaning ""to change into a beast, especially a beast from a monstrous form"". The word ""boreas"" is another word that comes from the Greek word omegaleion (metamorphoses), used to mean ""man-sized monster"", but in this case it is used to refer to the sea monster Boreas and its mythological counterparts. 
  
 In the English-speaking world, ""monstrous"" (and sometimes ""beastly"") is most often applied to human-sized monsters, including dragons, ogres, and ghouls, and is frequently applied to human-sized monsters, such as Godzilla, the Hulk, Dracula, and the Terminator. In the sense of"
2,"islands It is not uncommon for tourists to ask about Iceland, a country with its own peculiar culture and history. In their eyes, they often encounter a land that is all ice, glaciers, and frozen volcanoes. But if you think that that is what Iceland looks like, you are probably not very aware of the different landforms. 

If you have ever wondered how Icelanders travel all around this land, what the glaciers look like, or how much money they are making from tourism, then these articles will help you. Take a look and find out what really Iceland looks like.

Geologic formation of the South Coast Peninsula

South Coast Peninsula is an island that is part of Reykjanes Peninsula. At the North coast of South Coast Peninsula is the island of Mývatn. To the east of South Coast Peninsula there is the island of Eyjafjallajökull. The shape of the island changes throughout the day depending on the amount of melting or freezing.

There are two main rivers that flow into the East Sea, Raufoss and Grindavik. On the East side of the Island there is a great landscape and natural areas where you can hike and explore. You can easily access the East Sea by car.

2,"quests The quests in this game are often hard to explain and may require you to look for other players to complete them. There are several examples of this with the following being some of the most common:

A quest called ""Return to sender"". This quest is a simple one, you must travel from the front of the city, to the middle of the town, to the back of the town and back in a certain amount of time. You need a portal, you need a character that can portal, you need another character that has already portal, you need a team of three and you need to complete the quest before the end time.

You may get other quests that will require different resources, but the end result is similar. Some of the quests are only for members, some for non-members.

A quest called ""Kill 50 animals"". You need to kill 50 beasts that appear in the woods. These beasts are very dangerous, but some are very easy to kill. The catch is that you are required to catch every single beast that you kill. So you need to bring a lot of tools, supplies, traps, and other items to complete this quest.

The rewards for quests and certain bosses vary.

There are also a lot of quests in the game that will require the use of potions, alchohol or other items that you can find in the game. These can range from simple, but easy to complete, to very hard to complete."
2,"realms This realm is a physical place. It can be a place in the sky, or the ocean, or an entire island, or anything else. This realm belongs to a single person, and they choose who can access it.
For example, the realm of the Dark Lord.
This realm belongs to Voldemort. He chooses who can be in his realm. As of the beginning of the story, only Harry and Neville are in the realm. Voldemort cannot remove people from the realm without their consent. If they want to leave, they can, and Voldemort can remove anyone from his realm without their consent. He can even ask other people to enter his realm.
You can find out what the realms of other people are by listening to the Ministry of Magic. They talk about the realm of Voldemort in several places.
Note: The names of people are often in quotes (as in ""In the realm of the..."" or ""The realm of the...""), because the name of the realm is often different from the name of the person living there.
realm The Realm of Fire

This realm is associated with the Dark Lord, Voldemort, and is his actual body. The Dark Lord is locked in the Tomb of the Dark Lord.
This realm is outside of time; time stops here, and it does not flow in or out. The Dark Lord controls it. He uses the power of the Dark Arts to rule the Dark Lord's realm.

The farmhands come and go, and so does the little boy's father. The ghost that the boy grows up to love is the old farmer, Mr. Brown, and he is often by the boy's side. A neighbor, the farmer's wife, also comes to the cottage often. The cottage has also been visited by old ghosts, spirits that are not so friendly. Old Gray, a ghost with bad breath, and Mr. White, a ghost with a heart the size of a grapefruit, are frequent visitors. Gray is a man who has died in his dreams, and had not awakened. White is a ghost with long white hair, and he is a child's ghost. The cottage has been the scene of much mayhem, and each ghost has a reason for his or her presence. Gray, who is the ghost of a poor farmer, was beaten and left for dead by a group of cruel men when the men found that he was blind. He roams the fields, searching for an open field where he can sleep and be in the light. White and Gray are also seeking out an open field, but for very different reasons.

2,"pirates They were a fearsome crew of marauders and pillagers, but the pirates known to history were also some of history's most fascinating characters. With all its violence and adventure, is history repeating itself in the 21st Century?
From the time the Spanish explorer Christopher Columbus first laid eyes on a group of Indians, he has been fascinated with pirates. This was mainly because they were able to wreak their own kind of havoc on a whole nation, and in a way the history of the Americas may well have been shaped by the pirates of this era.
The first pirate attack in the Caribbean dates back to 1520, when a Portuguese explorer discovered the island of Guadalupe. The native people there, the Taino, took over the island, and named it San Juan, after the Virgin Mary.
As the Spanish and Portuguese battled for dominance, they clashed not only in the waters of the Caribbean, but in the land as well.
In 1492, the Taino were defeated by Spanish forces under the command of conquistador Francisco Pizarro. Pizarro massacred the people and captured the women and children.
In the next century, the Spanish explorer and navigator, Cabral, was in the Caribbean when an Indian called Bartholomew Roberts led his band of pirates against Spain.
Bartholomew Roberts was born in what was then the Dutch province of New Netherland. The Dutch had already been the dominant commercial power in the Caribbean"

2,"enchantments The world is full of enchantments. 
Enchantments are different from spells: 

Enchantments are not limited in time; they may exist for as long as the creature they affect lives. They can also affect the same creature more than once, though the effect of the enchantment may decay over time. (See below for details.)

Enchantments are not limited in scope:  

Enchantments can affect things like locations (an enchanting ring that can make anyone into a king in your kingdom), persons (a knight who can make himself impervious to poison), and objects (a sword that won't break until someone strikes it with another sword). 

Enchantments don't require the spellcasters to know the spell's effect. In fact, the spellcaster doesn't even need to be aware of the enchantment. The enchantment can exist as long as the creature's caster does. Thus, if a wizard casts a spell, but never discovers that it produces an enchantment, that enchantment could exist for centuries, much longer than any spell.

Enchantments last only as long as the caster of the enchantment still lives. (See below for details.)

The effects of a creature's enchantment are permanent, so the enchantment doesn't need to wear off in order for that creature to lose his or her status (such as being a knight).

The enchanting creature can still be used for other purposes. Thus, a"

The fortress fortresses were constructed mainly during the late Ming Dynasty, while the walls of the fortress in the north and east was constructed during the late Ming Dynasty. These were constructed by the Ming emperor Kangxi. There were many smaller, but important forts, constructed during the Ming Dynasty as well.
The ancient wall had been destroyed and rebuilt many times in its history. As of now, the fortresses on the wall in the southwest have been destroyed by an earthquake and the fortresses in the south and east had been greatly changed by the time the Ming dynasty was ended. The south and east walls had been changed to a plain wall, while the northern wall was still made of bricks. The Ming emperor had repaired and strengthened the wall so that it can withstand further change to the wall and was built a fortress in the northeast corner of the wall to protect the most valuable items in the Ming era. Although it was repaired, the Ming emperor decided to tear down the most valuable and ancient fortresses and reconstruct them when he had the Ming Dynasty ended.
The walls of the ancient fortresses was built by the Ming emperor Kangxi. At first, there were two parallel walls, which stretched from the southeast to the northwest. Each parallel wall was built by the Ming emperor Kangxi, which is approximately 15 m long. The walls have several passages through it.

2,"dimensions Nominal Dimensions: Width, Height, Depth, Length
These are the dimensions of the robot as a whole, and will include everything from the arm to the battery (if applicable). These dimensions are intended for planning purposes only and will not necessarily be the same as the dimensions given by the build documentation or any other 3D printing method.
The dimensions that you see in this chart are for a complete unassembled build, meaning that it includes all of the required parts to make the robot complete as shown. These dimensions do not include any additional custom 3D printing parts or upgrades. The recommended final dimensions for the robot should be around 1/3–2/3 of this size, as long as the final dimensions include everything required for assembly.
For any custom builds, keep in mind that the final dimensions will depend on a lot of factors. For example, the parts you print on your printer will be longer or shorter depending on the resolution you print at, as well as the part size and material you chose for your prints. The additional upgrades you will install can also affect the final dimensions, as you can easily change the sizes or add features to make your upgrade more effective for your specific needs. Please note that no two complete builds will be exactly the same, and all dimensions will vary slightly depending on the final size of the finished model.
When you place an order for a printed part or upgrade, you will be given a quote that includes a free measurement service. Using the"
2,"galaxies In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token ""|||||"". Your task is to summarize them.(Phys.org)—Astronomers have spotted the youngest galaxy ever found. The object is thought to be just 200 million years old, which would make it about 12 times younger than the oldest galaxies. In contrast, the universe as a whole is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old. The team of international astronomers discovered this galaxy while studying the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 2 and noticed it quickly moving out of view. They estimate that it's roughly five times more massive than our own Milky Way. In a new paper, they describe finding the object, its age and some other observations. They are confident in the object's age because it's the right size and they think it formed at the right temperature. They also note its location—it's part of a group of galaxies that formed together in a single cluster of hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. If proven correct, this object would be very old and ""one of the most recent galaxies to appear in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.""
This is the first time anyone has found a galaxy as young as this in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, said one of the authors, Michael Hintze of the University of Arizona. One of the researchers who spotted the object, Jonathan Binford of the University of North Carolina, called the object ""an early signal of a"
2,"robots This is a discussion on robots within the A Brief History of Cprogramming.com forums, part of the Community Boards category; I think robots have great potential to add a lot to programming and teach us a lot about programming...

... while I think it's the case that it is a bad idea to use robots to solve problems that are better solved using a human, I think the opposite is also true - that it will force a lot of people to try programming because they might not have thought about it before. It is possible, for example, that a lot of people will get hooked on programming and then begin to teach themselves. The only danger there is that programming could become an addiction for some people. In fact, I would not be surprised if some of the top developers have a programming addiction (I've seen it and even experienced it myself). The same applies to teaching beginners. They could become addicted to teaching.

What do you think about this? In fact, what is your take on robots? Are they just a bad idea? Or do they have a chance of being beneficial in certain cases?I'm of the opinion that robots can be useful, but need some control in the language they are being built in. The thing about the problem of teaching beginners is that if they are able to get hooked, they can then teach themselves. This can be a good thing for many, but, in some sense, it limits their learning. I know that the C"

2,"explorers Nostalgia is a strong word and not the first word which comes to mind when you think of games of the last 20 years. Yet, the most successful games of the last two decades - from Tetris, Mario, and Super Mario World to SimCity and Grand Theft Auto - started out as obscure arcade games or were released on a single console.
Games are often defined by their beginnings, and the launch date of the games listed in this article can be used as a landmark when looking back at a game's first years in the industry.
The game was inspired by an old arcade game called ""Crazy Taxi"" by the same studio. In 2001, it was released exclusively on the PSX, which was already a very popular platform at the time.
After spending less than a year in its arcade form, the game was released on the Nintendo 64 and PS2. On both systems, the game received a positive reception.
In 2002, a new version of the game was released on mobile devices and the PS3/Xbox 360. The Mobile Version was a remake while the PS3 and 360 versions were direct ports.
The PC version was released alongside the Mobile Version, but it was later made available to purchase as a standalone title.
This port was met with mixed reception by critics, but it received mostly positive reviews. The game was a commercial success, selling over 500,000 copies and was recognized as one of the best arcade games of all time.

 One of the biggest, richest and most influential families in the world is about to face some pretty serious questions from some of its most important customers: Wall Street. 
  
 The family owns two-thirds of American Express and the other one-third owns Citigroup. They are some of the largest investors in both companies, and both of them are set to receive reports tomorrow—from the Fed and from their own board of directors—that are expected to spell out what they can do to help the financial system. 
  
 As of now, they're already doing a pretty good job of that. And the family also owns 20 percent of Visa, which owns 8 percent of Goldman Sachs, and 6 percent of MasterCard, which owns 5 percent of Goldman Sachs. 
  
 But now those families are going to face some serious decisions. As I wrote this morning, there is already talk—with no evidence whatsoever—about whether A.E.G. could help the market crash. And there is also talk about whether A.E.G. could rescue it.

2,"wizards Wizards is a strategy board game, published by Avalon Hill in 1994. It is based on the board game Settlers of Catan. It was the first game in which the rules of all the components of the game were presented. The original game featured 2 to 4 players, each playing a unique card for each player, and one player controlling the cards of the other players. In the 2-player variant, the other players are the game's counters and the one player controls the counters by placing them on the map. This variant was also the first board game that was packaged with a rule book, and featured artwork by Paul Rand.
The 3-player variant uses 1 rule book and 2 game boards. The game is a relatively simple strategy game that involves the players playing their hand of cards to win the game. Players take turns placing cards on the map in order to increase or decrease the amount of cards in their hand. Cards placed on the map will be drawn by another player, either based on the placement of the card, or if no player is available to place it.
In 3-player, each player controls two maps. The first player places the cards on his map. He then turns off that map and passes the controller of the two maps to the second player. The second player takes turns placing cards on the other maps, but the first player can challenge that player to a hand fight, by selecting one card from his hand, and placing it on the map. The"
2,"detectives ""Detective"" is a detective series, consisting of eight novels and a novella written by American author Nancy Drew. The series is set in the fictional town of Washington Heights, New York. The protagonist is Nancy Drew, a 14-year-old detective who uses her wits and skills to solve crimes and find evidence. The series, which became extremely popular for its mysteries, is currently being republished in paperback format.
""Detective"" is the first novel in the Nancy Drew series. The character was created by Carolyn Keene and was first published in her Nancy Drew comic book series in 1939. The title was later changed to ""Detective"" because Carolyn Keene wanted to capitalize on the popularity of radio shows and movies that used the title ""detective.""
""Detective"" is set in the fictional town of Washington Heights, New York, and follows the adventures of Nancy Drew as she investigates a case of missing money and the murder of a police officer. Both the series and the books became enormously popular, and the series of novels is often seen as one of the most successful and influential youth novels of all time.
The first edition of ""Detective"" was published in 1939 by G. P. Putnam's Sons, a leading publishing company that began in 1847. Its success was so overwhelming that they were forced to print another edition of the book just two weeks later. This was the start of a long-running and successful series of books in which"
2,"criminals Criminals and corrupt officials are responsible for making Zimbabwe a failed state, writes the Financial Gazette. President Robert Mugabe’s economic policies have been blamed for high unemployment, a failing medical system and widespread hunger.
A leading economist argues that Zimbabwe’s economic ills are caused by criminals and corrupt politicians who have no interest in creating jobs for the country’s unemployed youth, The Chronicle reports.
Andrew Gudlau says Zimbabwe has been hit hard by the scourge of politicians who are more concerned about their positions and bank accounts than doing things that will help the citizenry.
“They are the ones who are the real culprits. They do not care how many jobs are created or how many people get fed as long as they are not losing their positions,” Gudlau, director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, told the newspaper.
“The country is being run by a very small group of people, who do not care about the lives of their people, but only their own personal interests. The government and security services have been given the power to decide on the fate of their people by virtue of their positions. This is unacceptable.
“All of this would have been avoided if Zimbabweans had politicians in parliament who were focused on solving problems rather than serving self-interests,” he said.
Gudlau said while the current political dispensation has failed to address key economic issues — jobs,"
2,"ghosts I believe in ghosts. There are many reasons why I think they exist. One of them is because I have had experiences which make me question the reality of the one I'm with. I used to live in a haunted house, for instance. Some of the times I'd be downstairs, when I'd hear footsteps, or a door slamming. Other times, I'd be upstairs, when I'd be able to hear a ghost moving around my room. That's a little spooky, don't you think? I never saw a ghost, though. Maybe I did, but I just don't remember it. But, I still think there are some. Just to prove it, I'll show you some evidence. There was an incident with a ghost I had a few years ago. I had been to a funeral in my childhood, and I'd just gotten back to my house. My family lives in a tiny little neighborhood, in a house which is, honestly, kind of creepy. It's old and rundown, and it's filled with dark corners and dim lighting. Anyway, I'd been walking around a bit, and was standing in front of the kitchen's big, old window. It's the only one in the house, and it lets in a ton of light. Well, it was late in the afternoon, and a beautiful, sunny day, so I was standing outside in the light.

But the team didn’t really consider using “apocalypse” as a title for the game.
“In Poland you could say this is a zombie apocalypse, but not this game is set in this universe or this era where there is zombies,” Legutko explained.
“When you talk about zombies there’s only one place in the world and that’s the Caribbean. So we came up with riptide, a reference of a riptide, which is a thing in the sea.
“We came up with that because it’s a place where a lot of zombies can come,” he added.
Dead Island Riptide is slated for release on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC on February 21 next year. A PS Vita release has also been announced.

But the government has a lot of balls to throw, and these demons don't want those balls thrown at all, especially in this hot, humid climate.
Because of that, the government is going to have to make some tough decisions to decide which demons -- or demons-in-human-form -- deserve protection under the law. Those decisions will have to take into account the fact that, in this heat, the government's balls are very wet and slippery, and can become dangerously lost.
Those balls also don't want the government to be thrown around by an overly aggressive government. And so, they've started looking for a place to hide: inside the human body. And they're trying to recruit Americans to do the dirty work for them.
Those humans include doctors. And those doctors have developed new ways to create human-in-a-human-body organs, such as livers and kidneys -- organs that aren't made by humans, but by humans who are then inserted into a human body. Once that human is done being inserted, the government-created organ is removed.

2,"superheroes A superhero's greatest fear is being caught.
The FBI is closing in on ""Batman"" before he can apprehend criminals in Gotham City. But one man wants to help the masked crusader: his best friend, James Gordon. He just doesn't know it.
Batman, played by Christian Bale, is determined to keep his identity secret from the world. So how can he manage to pull off the greatest heist in the history of the universe, without ever setting foot in Gotham City?
The answer to that lies in a ""secret weapon"" that the world's greatest detective never knew he had, in the form of a young tech genius by the name of Gordon, played by Joaquin Phoenix. But the story is not really about Batman or the mystery of his identity. It's about two friends learning to understand and accept the fact that we all are capable of extraordinary acts if we put our minds to it.

2,"time-travelers If there are multiple versions of the timeline or the future, what are the chances of an earth bound time traveler being the one who is able to travel to one of them, or even another one? 

A:

That possibility is the very reason we have time machines. The more likely one's timeline is the more likely one is to be able to observe it. Time machines enable observation, which allows future-travelers to influence the past.
The question you're asking is about temporal causality, that is, what causes the past or future to be the way it is. There are multiple ways of doing this: causal causality, the law of cause and effect, or temporal causality. We can't really answer that question without knowing how that works. 
Causal causality states that there is a particular order to events, like the arrow of time. We call that causal causality because events tend to follow a particular path. Things that are caused by a temporal agent (time machine or no) typically don't cause temporal agents, as such agents can only cause temporal agents.
Temporal causality is what is typically seen in time travel stories. One agent starts a chain of events by doing something, then something else follows, and the chain continues until some event or some event happens. The chain may continue indefinitely. A temporal agent changes the state of the past to create some events that might or might not have happened but do, and then starts"
