A2,"Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings like museums to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Then, the engineers work out how much weight the walls, floors and roof can hold. The builders then come and make the bricks and concrete needed, and put them all together. It is a team effort and everyone is very important.

## How buildings are made

The first step is to plan the building.

Everyone must work together and work safely.

## Tips

1. To design a building, we first need to know who is going to use the building, why they are going to use it, and where it is going to be built. This way we can design a building that is suitable for everyone.
2. The team has to work together, so that everyone can put their ideas and skills into the project.
3. It is important to plan and work safely because safety is essential for every individual, and everyone should get home from the building site at the end of the day.

After we go the people here in Dante's Peak will stay. They have their shops and their businesses. You think only about volcanoes but this is about money too.' 'OK' Harry said with a smile. 'If I'm your best man I have to be there for you. We need to know when you are leaving. We need to get out of here.' Paul knew exactly how his friend felt. In a place like Dante's Peak it was clear that Harry's specialised knowledge of volcanoes made him feel uncomfortable. All his time in the town had been spent analysing, observing and worrying. His thoughts were rarely distracted and he felt a constant sense of foreboding. But his role as the best man was all about loyalty to his friends, and the decision to stay or go was not a difficult one to make for Harry. 'Today we have a chance to save lives. Maybe we could go away tomorrow if we wanted.' 'No' said Harry. 'I won't go. I'm your best man and this town has problems.' 'Yes' said Paul 'you are my best man. But you must understand something.

A2,"Careful! Fight with your head don't fight with your heart boy!' shouted Bowen. The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter. But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code. Sir Bowen and all the kings princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. And the Old Code made it all work. The knights made sure there were no battles in the land. The kings were responsible for the wellbeing of their people and made sure every peasant had enough to eat. This was why knights fought for king and for country. In battle the king never told his knights to fight. Instead he told them to 'serve and protect'. Sir Bowen saw his task as both teaching Einon to fight and teaching him the ways of the knight. So he often made up exercises that combined both training and teaching. Today, Bowen had sent Einon to collect water from the well at the other end of the grounds. At the other end of the grounds Einon found a man he recognized as a vagabond. He had been begging in the streets since sun-up and would sleep under a bush until dawn. Bowen always said that beggars should not be given anything. It was the knight's job to send them away without giving them a penny. Einon was just about to fill his water skin when the vagabond started talking to him. ´Who are you?´ asked the vagabond. Einon told him his name, but didn´t say he was Bowen´s boy. ´Are you a peasant? ´ asked the vagabond. ´No, I am a knight´, said Einon. The vagabond laughed. "
A2,"The History of Farming Before people started farming they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. They found out that they could help plants grow by putting their seeds into the ground. This meant they did not have to keep on moving to look for food anymore. In the beginning they grew a few plants such as wheat and barley. Barley is a plant that is used to make beer.

They invented tools, learned new things and built villages. Some even began to keep animals, first for food but later for work too. This made farming easier.

A2,"ICE-FISHING If you drive north from Toronto for three hours you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter the lake becomes ice and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. The ice is so thick people can walk across the lake.

Ice-fishing in Canada is like summer holidays for the Canadian fisherman. It is also the best opportunity for the local people to work. When the lake freezes in January, the businessmen in town, who sell supplies to the fishermen, have a good few months of business. Restaurants and hotels do very well, and there are even ice-fishing contests in the towns near the lake.

In the summer, many people visit Nipissing, the fishing capital of Canada. They sit in their boats or fish from the shore. There are guides, stores, and restaurants.

The fishing here is world-class and some of the lakes are more than 200km2. However, the lake is most famous for its walleye, a type of fish that everyone enjoys eating. In the winter the walleye move deeper into the lake, so it is best to go ice fishing.

However, the ice fishing season is not very long. From January to March fishermen can catch walleye, pike, and trout in the icy water. To catch the fish, they use an auger which is like a special saw which cuts a hole in the ice. Through this hole, the fishermen drop a piece of fishing line called a jig, with a small bright coloured lure attached to it."
A2,"A man heard me and looked round. Then this big man saw me in the corn. He walked to me and I began to shout loudly: ' His foot is going to kill me ! ' The man stopped. For a minute he looked down at me carefully. (We look at a small animal in the same way and think: 'Will it hurt me?') His foot did not kill me!

As the man looked at me I could see him counting my fingers! I could not believe how big he was, even bigger than a house. I could not move, but I was not scared because I knew he would not hurt me. It was not the fear of death, but a fear of having my feet kicked. Then he realized that I was a person. His face changed from being friendly to hostile and angry, and he began to shout, ' I will kill you!' but it was more like a threat or warning.

I realized that he was not going to kick me, but only wanted to use me as his friend. Then he said that he wanted to be my friend. ' I will protect you!' he shouted angrily. But I was scared!

My friend tried to catch me but I escaped. Then he tried to get me again with his foot and he missed me. I managed to escape. But he caught me after he tried to kick me three times! Then he kicked me three times with the same foot and I fell to the ground.

When I got home I was happy that he did not kick me. When I was in the corn I was a little bit scared. My mother scolded me because I was out late, and did not come home. So, she was very angry with me and she blamed me for lying. When I was in the corn,"

A2,"Big cats There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot! Tigers live in India and Siberia. They are good swimmers and can catch fish in rivers and lakes.

Lions are not the biggest cats but they are the kings of the jungle. They are found in Africa. They are good swimmers and climbers. Lions live in groups called prides. There are usually between 3 and 20 lions in a pride. Male lions are the dominant members of the pride. They will fight to protect their females and their cubs from other male lions.

There are also smaller cats like the ocelot. These are found in South America and they love to climb trees. They are agile and can get around very quickly on the ground and in the trees.

In the end the main differences between big cats are size and where they live. Lions live in the jungle while tigers live in forests. Ocelots are found in the trees! Despite their differences all these cats have a lot in common. They are all carnivores and they are all predators. They will hunt for their food. They have strong legs and sharp teeth for catching their prey. They will often choose the same prey. They eat birds, small animals and sometimes other cats! All the big cats are beautiful animals. Their different patterns make them easy to spot and identify.

Lions have a distinctive pattern of white patches on their body. This pattern"
A2,"Marco stood at the door of Silvia's flat and watched Gabriel leaving. He looked carefully at his clothes and his shoes. Why didn't Silvia open the door? She was in there. Then suddenly it opened. 'Silvia dear' Marco said 'you look wonderful ...' He stopped. Silvia didn't look wonderful. Her face was red and she looked unhappy. Then he saw the room. Silvia's paintings were all over the floor. He looked at her with great concern. 'I'm sorry' he said. Silvia burst into tears and threw herself in his arms.

I think this story is about Marco, who wanted to surprise Silvia with a romantic evening. Marco thought that he had a good idea of what she would like: romantic music, a meal cooked by a professional chef, and roses. When he arrived at the door of Silvia's flat, he looked at Gabriel, who was leaving. Then, he was surprised by the way Silvia looked. He assumed that something must have happened with Gabriel. He was shocked when he saw the mess in the apartment and the paintings on the floor. Silvia was very unhappy with his surprise. Then he tried to comfort her, but it didn't work.

First, I would change the title to ""The romantic surprise.""

Second, I would start with something like this:

Silvia had just received a letter from Marco. In it, he explained that he was coming to visit her that night. He was going to arrive at her door step with roses in hand. He wanted it to be a romantic surprise.

He was a wonderful friend, and Silvia enjoyed his company very much. She was very excited about his letter, but she didn't really know why he was coming to see her.

A2,"'I am quite well' I always answered. Why did I say that? Why did I not ask for his help? Perhaps because in one sense it was true. I was not in pain. 'It cannot be the mysterious illness from the village' I thought. 'My illness is now three weeks old. I think it will never get better. I think it will always get worse.''

F.Scott Fitzgerald

""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" a 2006 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, tells the story of a man who ages in reverse. Benjamin Button, a character with a curious biological condition, ages in reverse. His physical appearance rejuvenates with age. Benjamin, unlike most humans, grows younger instead of older as he advances through the years. ""For all of my life people have done things in front of me, but now, for the first time, I can make my own choices and have them followed, even when they are stupid choices,""

The story, originally published in the September 1922 issue of Collier's Weekly, reflects an extraordinary concept of aging. The author uses this concept as a backdrop to explore various themes such as love, time, and mortality. By reversing the aging process, the story questions the traditional notion of time and encourages readers to reconsider their understanding of time's linearity.

Benjamin Button, born with an aging disorder, lives life in reverse. Growing younger as he ages, he learns from experience, not through age. At the beginning of the story, the protagonist is an old man, but he grows younger as he goes through life. ""I am two months old"

A2,"POSTCARDS Today people like to send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards often have pictures of beaches mountains or castles on them and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. But for thousands of years people sent letters to each other.

PAPER The oldest paper ever discovered was found in Egypt and is almost 3,000 years old. It was made of papyrus. Before there was paper, there were scrolls. Some of these were very long, but because they were made of paper, they could be rolled up and carried around. People didn't usually write on one side of the paper, they wrote on both sides.

LETTER WRITING People used to write letters to their friends and family when they were far away. They did this because there was no telephone. The person who wrote the letter would write their message with a pen or pencil and then put it in an envelope. They would then take it to the post office and give it to a postman, who would take the letter to another post office. Then someone there would take the letter and deliver it to the person who had written it. The person who received the letter would then read it and maybe write a reply.

POST OFFICE The post office is a place where you can send and receive letters and packages. It is run by people who are called postmen or postwomen. These are the people who work at the post office and drive the special vehicles that carry the mail from one place to another. They used to be called mailmen, but women were not allowed to work, so now it's politically"
A2,"The history of horse racing From the first history books ever written it is clear that horse racing has always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. From the earliest recorded racing in 1174 in England (when King Henry II established the St. Albans horse races), it has continued to be one of the most popular sports in the United Kingdom. The English set the standards for the sport and the other nations followed their example. The history of horse racing in the United States dates back to the 1600s when the first English colonists arrived. They brought with them their horses and the passion for the sport. The first race was held in 1674 and, as the popularity of the sport increased, the first organized horse races started to be held. The most prestigious races in American horse racing are the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. The Kentucky Derby, held in Louisville, Kentucky every year since 1875, is known as ""The Run for the Roses"" and is considered by many to be the greatest two minutes in sports. The Preakness Stakes, held near Baltimore in Maryland since 1873, is the second leg of the Triple Crown Series and traditionally comes second in the order of races. The most prestigious horse race in the world is considered to be the English Triple Crown, which consists of the 2000 Guineas Stakes, the Epsom Derby, and the St. Leger Stakes. The winner of these three races is crowned the winner"
A2,"It was more than three months after Lynette's death. Jude and Dad were sitting at the table looking at a map. Mum was out walking. Suddenly Dad stood up. 'Come with me Jude' he said. 'Where are you going Dad?' I asked. 'To a meeting.' 'What meeting? Can I come?' 'No you're too young' said Dad. They left. I was bored. Then Mum came in. 'What are you doing here?' she asked. 'They've gone to a meeting.' 'Let's play cards, let's play rummy.' 'Alright Mum,' I said. 'Rummy it is.'

A little later Dad came back with a bag. 'We've bought you a bike' he said. 'Thank you Dad!' 'Be careful you must wear a helmet to be safe' said Mum. 'Sure, sure,' I replied.

I waited until a week later before I went riding the new bike. As I rode along I felt happy and excited because it was the first time for me. I rode from my house to the park and back, and in total I rode for 15 kilometres. It was a big day for me because I had my very first bike! I was able to go where I wanted without anyone's help, and I felt free, even though I had to wear my helmet because I needed to be safe.

In the afternoon, Dad and Mum took me to the beach. I rode my bike to the sand where they were. I played in the waves and sands feeling happy and free. I am sure it was the happiest day of my life. I now have a bicycle and the ability to go places by myself. But I must remember to always wear a helmet.

Suddenly Sancho Panza, who was walking behind the horses, noticed a sheep lying in the grass. He quickly picked it up and ran to his master. 'Look Don Quixote. Look what I've found.' Sancho held the sheep in front of Don Quixote. 'You'll have to carry the sheep as well' said the driver. 'I'm sure it's an enemy of yours' 'Who me? I can fight a lion, can't I?' said Don Quixote.

Soon they arrived at a farm. They asked the farmers if they could stay the night and were given permission. They decided to have dinner in the kitchen. The cook asked them what they would like. Sancho suggested they could eat lamb chops. The cook replied, 'With pleasure. I see Sancho has brought us a lamb from the mountains for our dinner.'

Then the driver decided to open the box in which the lion was sleeping. To everyone's surprise, they saw a beautiful donkey inside. 'Ah!' said Don Quixote. 'Here is my greatest enemy. I have defeated him at last.' The farmers, who had gathered to see this new adventure, laughed a great deal.

The next morning, the driver and his donkey left with the horses and Sancho Panza stayed with Don Quixote. They continued their journey to the next town."

A2,"Kong went back to Ann and took her down from the high rock. For the first time in this jungle she felt strangely safe. He jumped across a ravine and then across a river. She was a small plaything between his large fingers. Then he stopped and put her down. “You are my friend now, Ann.”

The Jungle Doctor’s Journal by Dr. Wilbur Pickett, first published in 1951, is a collection of stories written from Dr. Pickett’s experiences as a medical missionary in the jungles of the Belgian Congo. This book is unique in that it offers a first-person perspective on early medical missions, showing the challenges faced by missionaries and the love they had for the people they served.

For more information on this title and other books by Dr. Wilbur Pickett, visit:
www.JungleDoctorJournal.com

Dr. Wilbur Pickett was a medical missionary in the Belgian Congo in the early 20th century, and he used his experiences to inspire a series of novels. The novels follow the doctor’s adventures as he journeys into the remote jungle, treating the sick, and converting the heathen to Christianity. The stories are interesting, but they also show the reader how the Congolese people are superstitious, and how the locals have a deep respect for their missionaries.

The Jungle Doctor’s Journal is the first book in the series, and it is a collection of short stories. In the first story, the doctor tells of his introduction to the jungle and its inhabitants. He meets Kong, a local who is fascinated with the doctor and wants"

A2,"Madame Tussaud's One very famous place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Here people can see figures of famous people made of wax. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle a doctor made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris. Madame Tussaud joined her uncle at the museum. The French Revolution came to Paris and people from all over the world came to see it. The museum made lots of money. The museum was attacked during the revolution and the figures were destroyed. Madame Tussaud had to move. She went to London in 1802. She opened a museum in London. Madame Tussaud has figures of famous people.

Madame Tussaud's museum has grown over the years. Today, there are more than 300 figures in the museum. It is a very famous place to visit in London. Madame Tussaud's wax figures are very lifelike. They look exactly like the real person. You can touch their hair and skin and they look like real skin and hair.

The figures are so good that some people don't believe they are wax. Some people think they are real and try to talk to them. Madame Tussaud's figures are made by artists. The artists use special tools and materials to make the figures. The figures are made of wax and cloth. The museum in London is very popular with visitors. People like to come and take pictures with the figures. The museum is very crowded, especially when a new figure is added.

Madame Tussaud's museum has had some famous visitors over the years. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited the museum in 18"
A2,"The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are quite near each other. On the road between them there are a lot of green hills and fields. On one of these hills is a picture of a very large man. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to him is called Cerne. He is very famous in Britain and many people like to come and see him.

The Cerne Giant, or Cerne Abbas Giant, is a prehistoric chalk drawing on a hill near Cerne Abbas in Dorset, southern England. The figure is known locally as the Rude Man because of the size of his penis. The hill figure was initially cut in the Middle Bronze Age and has been restored and repainted various times since its creation. He stands over 180 ft (55 m) high and 197 ft (60 m) long, although not all of this can be seen from ground level. The outline of the giant and his shield is visible from a great distance, and the figure is often considered to have been a sacred and possibly healing site. The site is also famous for the presence of several small stone settings or circles, one of which has been identified as a lunar observatory.

Sherborne and Dorchester are two historic towns in Dorset. Sherborne is known for its medieval castle and historic abbey, while Dorchester is home to the Thomas Hardy birthplace museum and the Dorset County Museum.

If you're interested in exploring the area, there are many walking trails that can take you through the picturesque countryside, including the Cerne Abbas to Maiden Castle walk, which takes you past the Cerne Giant and through the beautiful Dor"
A2,"The Rhino There are five different types of rhino in the world today. The Black and White Rhino live in the open fields of Africa. The others live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have big heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The great body of the rhino stands on four short legs. They have a strong head, large ears and a short, twisted horn on top of their nose. The horn is made of a material called keratin, just like the horn on a deer, but it is tougher. Rhinos do not always have a horn but many of them do. When a male rhino is mature, he grows a second horn on his forehead called a 'nasal' horn. The rhino is slow to move and does not have very good eyesight. They use their sense of smell, hearing and very sensitive skin to find food and enemies. Rhino can gallop at about 30mph if they need to get away quickly. They feed mostly on grass, leaves and twigs. Although most people would not class the rhino as pretty, their thick skin and stubby legs give them a great deal of protection from other animals. They can weigh between 400kg and 3000kg! This makes them one of the most massive animals on Earth. A white rhino. They can weigh up to 3,000 kg. Black rhino. They are also one of the biggest land animals and can weigh up to 2,000 kg. The two types of rhino that live in Asia are the Javan and Sumatran, the smallest of all the rhino types, weighing up to 1,000 kg. There are several problems that rhinos face in"
A2,"CANADA GEESE Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there. Last spring Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. He thought he'd help them learn how to fly and migrate to warmer climates by hitching a bicycle to them. It was a fun and exciting way to find out if young geese could fly and migrate as their parents do.

One bright morning in May Bill went out to his farm to check on his sixteen geese. He saw they were doing just fine, and he got this great idea. He would build a bicycle with wheels that were eight feet tall. It would hold twenty-six geese. It took him a few weeks to finish the bike, but when he was done it was an incredible site. It had huge wheels, it could fit twenty-six geese, and they could control the height with ropes. The tallest part was nine feet and three inches.

Now it was time to see if the geese would climb onto the bike and learn how to steer it. The first time Bill sent them out the bike was tipped over when the geese touched down. The second time around they did it right and they were off and flying. It was great and it was time for Bill to find some geese that need his help. He found some. They were three weeks old and ready to go.

A month passed, but these geese never really learned to migrate and fly all that well. They were scared of their shadows and they didn't like flying high off the"
A2,"Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago a long time before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died. The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There are many different kinds. Some were big; some were little. Some had very long necks. Some had very small heads. When scientists look at dinosaur bones, they can tell many things. They can tell what kind of dinosaur the bone came from. They can tell how big the dinosaur was. They can tell how old the dinosaur was. Scientists can tell how active the dinosaur was. They can tell many other things too. Dinosaurs lived in many different places. They lived in hot climates. They lived in cold climates. They lived in dry places. They lived in wet places. Dinosaurs ate lots of different things. They ate plants. They ate animals. Some dinosaurs were meat eaters. Some were plant eaters. There were very big dinosaurs. The largest dinosaur ever found was as long as two big school buses end to end!

The information in the text suggests that:

1. Some dinosaurs lived in climates that are hot.
2. There was a great variety in the types of dinosaurs.
3. Dinosaurs had no living relatives when they existed on earth.
4. Dinosaurs are extinct but their species survive in the form of birds.
5. Dinosaurs didn't live and eat the same way because some were meat eaters and others were plant eaters.

A2,"Piano players - when they were young Ivan Petrov Ivan was born on a farm in Russia but from the age of twelve to eighteen he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from the opera. His mother began to teach him the piano when he was six. By the age of twelve, Ivan was already a very able player. Ivan began to make a name for himself after one of his piano pieces was picked to be performed on a radio programme. The next few years passed and Ivan became more and more popular. When he was 19, he won a national competition and took the title of ""The Young Maestro"". Two years later he started at the conservatory.
Afterwards, Ivan Petrov began to perform in various countries. He played piano in cities like London, Berlin and Paris and became well known throughout Europe. In his later years he decided to teach at a music school where he shared his knowledge with others.

Teaching Tips: This passage is an excellent source for a ""predict/read"" activity. You could ask your students to predict, before reading, what the story will tell them about Ivan Petrov and what music skills he has. Then ask them to compare their predictions with the facts of the story. Use this opportunity to discuss the nature of deduction and predictability in texts.

The first piano was invented by a German, Bartolemeo Christoffel in the 1690s. Although his piano was a great improvement on the harpsichord, it was not a very great success, perhaps because it was extremely expensive to produce. In fact, Bartolemeo Christoffel was never"
A2,"After a long hard swim Pedro Serrano fell onto a beach tired but alive. There was no sign now of his broken ship lost under the waves. He waited for other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. The next morning Serrano looked around the island that saved his life. And saw a big snake in the grass.

There’s something wrong with this text. There may be a number of mistakes, but if there’s anything obvious, please tell me.

In any case, I’d rather give you a simple answer first. It’s not only that the narrator is telling the story of the man Pedro Serrano, but the man Pedro Serrano is telling the story. For this reason, the narration has to be done in the first person, since the man is speaking in the first person and the narrator also needs to. And that’s where the mistake is.

Another correction is the missing comma after the word beach. In English, if you have two or more related adjectives describing one thing, you need to use commas to separate them.

After correcting these mistakes, we could say something like this:

After a long hard swim, Pedro Serrano fell onto the beach, tired but alive. There was no sign now of his broken ship lost under the waves. He waited for other sailors from his ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. The next morning, Serrano looked around the island that had saved his life. And saw a big snake in the grass.

Note: Another point to consider is to add the word “his” to “his ship” so it becomes clear that the ship belongs to"
A2,"The Ruwenzori Mountains Mary Daniels is a student in England. This year she had a very interesting summer holiday. She travelled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help make a road through a forest between two big towns. 'It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops where we could buy food' said Mary. There was always a lot of rain. Mary and her friends had to walk very far to get to the forest. There was a river with a lot of crocodiles, so they could not drink the water in it. The people in the villages could not work. They had to stay at home. The most important person in the group was the leader, a man called Tim. He had a lot of experience in Africa. When the weather was good, they could sleep in the forest. They had to work very hard. In the evenings, they played games, sang songs, and sometimes they even told stories. After that, they went to bed early. Mary was tired a lot of the time, but she never forgot to do something interesting in Africa. The weather was very strange because it was often raining, but sometimes it was sunny. Now Mary's holiday is over. Her friends go back to their countries and Mary goes back to England. 'I really enjoyed myself in the Ruwenzori Mountains, said Mary 'I'd like to go there again someday. I met some friendly people there and I saw some wonderful things, such as wild animals, beautiful flowers, and wonderful views.' We think that the weather wasn't so bad, the people there were very friendly and it was really worth visiting the Ruwenzori Mountains.

A2,"There were many big fights at that time. People fought on horses with swords in their hands. The strongest and best knight always won. 'Perhaps the new king will come to the fight' thought the Archbishop. Sir Ector went to the fight with his two sons Sir Kay and young Arthur. When Sir Kay was about to have the fight, Sir Ector said to him 'Son, look for the weakest man and strike him first'. But Sir Kay answered, 'Sir, I can't find anyone to beat me. I can't find anyone to strike' He really wanted to fight against the best fighter in the tournament. Sir Ector was angry because he wanted his son to win the fight. But Sir Kay's young brother, Arthur, wanted to fight, too. He was very strong and he wanted to win a lot of prizes. So, Sir Ector allowed him to fight. Arthur fought with a giant named Surlamanca. It was a very hard fight and at first Arthur lost. But then Arthur hit Surlamanca with his sword on his neck. 'Ah!' screamed Surlamanca. Arthur won the fight. The Archbishop was very pleased because young Arthur was so good at fighting. The Archbishop told all the people that young Arthur was the best knight. When the king was at the court, the Archbishop told him all the news. 'Now the people will say that the son of the king is the best knight' said the Archbishop. 'And he deserves to be king!' said the Archbishop. Then, the king decided that Arthur should be the new king. But before Arthur could be king, he had to win a very hard fight against the best kn"
A2,"A great idea! Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys who grew up in the same small Canadian town. They have always been friends and classmates. Like all their other friends they enjoy going fishing or swimming at weekends. But for the last few months they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop.

What is it that keeps them so busy? They've both been passionate about movies for a long time and they want to make their own film!

They are both responsible for different aspects of the film. Frazer, who loves literature, is in charge of the story. Peter, who loves action, is in charge of special effects. At last their film is complete. It's a science fiction story about a group of children who fight against a strange virus which is going to kill all plants and animals.

At first they show the virus spreading around the world and causing devastation. They use a lot of special effects, like when a plant suddenly dries up in front of us, or when the virus appears in people's hands and they can't control it.

Then, the children's reactions to this tragedy are shown. They are all very scared and worried. Some of them show their frustration by destroying things.

The second half of the film is about a solution. The group of children find a way to save the world, which involves a lot of courage and determination. They show the children running towards danger, with a look of determination on their faces, just like superheroes.

Finally, they show the world returning to normal, with everything green and lively.

The film ends with the famous phrase used at the end of all James Bond films: ""the end"".

We started to believe Clayton too. It was only a story when he started and Clayton told very good stories. But now he was being very serious.

'Why don't you ask Clayton yourself?' asked Sam.

But Clayton had left.

'I was talking about my life,' said Clayton. 'He was trying to find out more about me. The ghost wanted to know what I did and what I felt. But I couldn't tell him. I didn't know.'

'Well, I'd like to meet him,' said Sam. 'Did he say where he came from?'

'I don't know,' said Clayton.

'That's silly,' said Wish.

'Perhaps it was one of your ancestors,' said Sanderson.

'I don't have any ghosts in my family,' said Clayton. 'You know that. We're normal people.'

'Did you think it was the ghost?' asked Sam.

'I know it was,' said Clayton. 'I saw it. I felt it. You can't imagine the feeling that comes over you. But when I tried to tell you what happened, I couldn't find the words. And I still can't. I feel as if I'm crazy.'

A2,"CROCODILES We can find crocodiles in tropical parts of the world for example Africa South America and Northern Australia. They spend most of the time in slow-moving water but they can move fast through the water and on land. You often see crocodiles together in large groups. They eat everything they catch like fish birds and small animals. Crocodiles do not make a roaring sound. They make a loud hissing sound or a low growling sound. Crocodile babies are independent from the moment they are born. They do not stay with their mother or the group of other babies. Crocodiles can live to be 70 to 100 years old. They may eat anything that is near the water but they prefer to catch bigger animals like deer and wild boar. Crocodile eyes are on the top of their head so that they can still see if most of their head is under the water. Crocodiles have a tough armour of overlapping bony plates that run down their back. This helps to protect them from other animals or from their own sharp teeth and beak-like jaws. Crocodiles can live in either salt water or fresh water. 400

I would like to return to England but next time I will stay in a different city. Thanks so much for all the nice times we spent together.

It was very kind of you to help me with my homework and I will always remember how friendly you were to me. I will miss you my dear friend and I hope we can keep in touch.

I have to tell you something very funny that happened to me on the plane back to my country. The man who was sitting next to me had a dog. A small dog in the plane. A real big dog. He had a leash, but no one at the airport wanted to let the dog on board. I thought he would never give in, but just when we were about to land, they let him and the dog on the plane. It’s funny how things happen sometimes!

Take care of yourself and give my regards to our other friends. I hope you are doing well.

Every morning I took some guns and walked about three miles to my place on the hill. I felt great. One day, the Chief of all the cannibals came to the house to see what I was doing. He had no idea what I was building, or why. He just wanted to see. I kept working, not bothering to tell him anything. Then, he saw the guns, and he asked about them. I told him that I had them for my protection. I said, ""I'm going to live here. It's my house, but if you want to come in, you can, and have a beer."" But I kept telling him I only wanted to protect myself. The Chief told me that he never saw anything like it. I liked that. It was nice to impress such a great man. After that, I helped him build something he wanted to do. That is the way to make friends. I gave the chief two of my motorbikes. One he could keep, and the other to show his people that he could ride a motorbike just like a White man. The Chief asked if he could ride with me to the next village, and I said, ""Sure."" There were about 20 motorbikes on the road. There was a lot of cheering. It was like a huge motorcycle parade. All the people were really excited. I was impressed, and so was the Chief.

P.P.S. 1st period had been very difficult today and I had been feeling down so I decided to share something that has brought a smile to my face which is a child's creative writing. I hope you enjoyed reading it too!

I am open to your thoughts and suggestions. I would love to know if you have any ideas on making the assignment more effective and engaging.

The assignment is to let the child use their imagination and create a story. I am open to new ideas so please share your thoughts!

P.P.P.S. The children all draw their own characters to go along with the story. They have their own unique way of telling a story and I believe it helps them to understand their own creativity. In addition, the Mayor character is from my previous home school which was an elementary school where I used to teach 2nd and 3rd graders. He was a popular character and I decided to bring him to my current home school (elementary school) to make the children feel comfortable. 😊

But I find it very difficult to sleep at night after a concert because my head is full of music. Sport is important. I like to play soccer or swim a few times a week. It keeps me fit and healthy. I've got an electrician friend who's mad about fishing. He keeps talking about how healthy it is and how much fun it is, but the only thing I can catch is sunburn, I'm not very good at it. I don't like beer, I don't like to smoke, and I don't like to stay out drinking and smoking late into the night. Those things are bad for you and make you feel tired the next day. Instead, I prefer to sleep or exercise. I think, I should have more time to eat healthy food, but I don't have much time. When I do have time, I prefer to have Chinese or Italian food. They're delicious and less fatty than fast food, like burgers and fries. Because of the travel, you can't eat healthy food all the time. I sometimes take vitamins. I do feel better after taking vitamins, but I don't like to take them very often. And of course, drink lots of water every day to keep you hydrated. My father gave me some advice.

A2,"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today there are policemen everywhere but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. The streets were filled with thieves, beggars, drunken sailors, and people who did not mind hurting others if they had to. The police force in 1739 London had a big problem with crime. Thieves stole anything that wasn't nailed down. Murder, assault, and robbery were common.

The King of England (George II) and the Lord Mayor of London wanted to do something about it. They got together and decided to pay for a group of men to walk around the city and keep people safe. A man named Robert Walpole made a law to help pay for the new police force. 1840 THE METROPOLITAN POLICE The police force had many problems at first. The men were not trained and the equipment was very old. The Metropolitan Police was officially born in 1829. In 1840, it expanded to become the 13-division force that it is today. In 1860, the police started to use the peach colored uniforms they wear today.

Bobbies (as they are called) are the most important part of the London police force. Today, they can handle all kinds of problems. THE RANK STRUCTURE The rank structure of the Metropolitan Police is like this: 1. Commissioner, 2. Deputy Commissioner, 3."
A2,"There's something out there! It threw an orange at me! Elliott said. ""Ooooo!"" said Tyler a friend of Elliott. ""An orange! Very dangerous!"" Elliott's mom Mary took a light and then she and the boys went into the yard. ""What did you see?"" Mary asked Elliott. ""Something there"" he answered. ""But it can't be there"" she argued. ""It threw me an orange"" Elliott insisted. ""Did you see this happen?"" ""Yes! That was when I was eating oranges in my play room"" she replied. ""Well,"" said Mary ""perhaps, a neighbor is having a barbecue"" Elliott was not convinced. ""No, we don't have any neighbors"" he answered. Then he looked at his friend Tyler and then back at the dark. Tyler had an idea. ""Let's investigate a little deeper"" he whispered. ""You stay here Elliott. I'm going inside to get my flashlight""

Tyler did as he said. He turned on his flashlight and then took both boys to the garden. There was total silence. They looked around for a few minutes. ""Do you see anything?"" Elliott asked. Tyler did not answer. He had the flashlight, which was now pointing to the ground. Suddenly, the light shone on something orange. It was not very big, but it was definitely orange. It seemed to be a fruit, maybe an orange. Tyler turned to look for Elliott who was no where to be seen. They called for him but he did not respond. They started to panic, as they could not find Elliott. That's when, they saw a tiny man holding an orange in his hand. ""Help! Help"
A2,"He started walking down to the village. It was difficult because he was very tired. He went carefully because he didn't want to fall again. By the end of the day he was at the river and he stopped for a drink. There were beautiful flowers near the river. 'This is a lovely place' Nunez thought. He saw something shinning at the bottom of the river. He went closer and saw that it was a gold coin.

Nunez felt very happy and thanked god. Then he started collecting other coins, and by the end of the day he had 10 gold coins.

When he got back to the village, he was very surprised because many people had come to welcome him. They all wanted to talk to him, and they were all very nice. When he told them what had happened, they asked him to tell them where exactly he had found the coins.

Nunez was very cautious and did not want to lead other people to the site. In case they took all the coins, he told them that he had found the coins near the river but not exactly where.

Nunez had 10 gold coins now and he didn't know what to do with them. He thought that it would be better to go to the nearby city and exchange his gold coins for money.

He took his bags and walked along the path to the city. It was a long journey and took him a few days to get there. When he reached the city, he went to the biggest hotel and asked for a room. In the evening, he went to the goldsmiths to exchange his coins for money. The goldsmith told him that all his coins were fake.

Nunez was very sad and disappointed."
A2,"That night it rained heavily. Mary woke up and could not sleep again. Suddenly she sat up in bed. 'It's that sound again!' she thought. She left her room and walked through the dark house. Sometimes she stopped and listened. She came to a door with a light under it.

Mary walked into the room. It was her mother's room. Her mother was not there. She saw some strange papers on the floor. She bent down to pick them up. Suddenly, she saw her mother's hand reach out to stop her. 'Mother!' Mary screamed. 'Don't!'

Mary's mother looked frightened and surprised. She was in her nightdress. She didn't look real to Mary. She knew that her mother was a ghost.

Mary was not afraid. She said, 'Mother, why do you come here every night?'

Mary's mother said, 'I wanted to be with you... I never wanted to leave.'

Mary replied, 'Mother, you have to leave now. The world is waiting for you.'

Mary's mother disappeared and the strange papers disappeared with her. Mary closed the door gently. She knew that the ghost of her mother was now at peace.

A2,"Parrots Perhaps you have seen these beautiful birds with their lovely colours and long tails in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil Australia and India. They usually live in large groups and because they like to eat fruit they are sometimes a problem for farmers.

Parrots are social birds who enjoy talking to each other and they are able to mimic sounds very well. They even sound like talking! Some of them can say hundreds of words.

Parrots usually build their nests in holes in trees. They lay between three to eight eggs that they take turns in sitting on. When the baby parrots are born they leave the nest and go and live with a group of other parrots called a flock.

Parrots need plenty of food and they like to eat seeds and fruits. They also need lots of exercise. One type of parrot even likes to climb trees! Parrots have very strong beaks and can break nuts to get at the seeds inside.

In the wild, parrots are facing threats to their survival. Many of them are losing their homes because of deforestation, so not all of them are able to live happily ever after in the forest anymore. Fortunately, some of these birds are now being taken care of in zoos and bird sanctuaries.

A2,"From: Greg To: Anna Hi Anna I’m not having a very good week! Yesterday my team had a volleyball match but we lost. The other team played much better than we did! Then my friend Jeff who lives in Australia telephoned with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he's got a summer job. Today my pet dog went to the vet's to be put down. I didn't get to go to the football game because I was taking my dog to the vet. I am so depressed! Could I go and play tennis tomorrow? Could you ask your mother? Love Greg

Here is my response: Anna to: Greg Hi Greg! Thanks for letting me know! 
I think your week has been bad and I am really sorry to hear about your dog. It’s always sad when a pet dies.
It seems that your week is a total disaster! First your volleyball team lost the match, then your friend can’t come to your house and finally your dog was put down by the vet.  
To be honest, if I was you, I would just stay home and rest. Playing tennis tomorrow is probably not a good idea because you are tired, sad and stressed out. You need some rest to get your energy back and to forget your recent troubles. 
Yesterday's match was a very important occasion for you but you weren’t able to make it because of your dog. This is really sad. Your friend can’t stay with you during the holidays which is also a real shame. 
I'm sure things will get better. It is important to always see the bright side of life despite our difficulties. 
Please take care and don't be upset. I'll let you know as"

""Where?"" asked his brother, Mark. Alan pointed out of the window.

""I think we're landing,"" said Alan. They watched the plane land.

As soon as the plane had landed, Alan jumped from the plane and ran to look at a huge dinosaur. He ran back to the plane, ""I've found one! We have to tell mum!"" he said. The two boys then found themselves in the jungle.

The island seemed almost magical. Alan and Mark loved finding dinosaurs. They found them everywhere. But then it all became scary. Alan fell from a tall tree and couldn't move. Mark knew they were in danger and he had to make a difficult decision to save his brother. Would Alan be able to walk again? Will they find a way to get off the island?

A2,"Curly couldn't attack the other dog because he was very fast. Suddenly he pushed Curly over and she fell on the ground. The other dogs ran at her and Curly barked with pain. But she couldn't stand up and the other dogs attacked her again and again. Buck couldn't move. He had watched all of this happen and now stood petrified, unable to do anything for his mate. Curly barked and whined in pain. This was the worst day of her life. It was something she would remember forever.

Curly loved Buck, and Buck loved her too. They had been together forever and always took care of each other. She was gentle, loyal and trusting, and that was what made her so vulnerable. She didn't trust the other dogs, and Buck had tried so hard to keep her safe. But he had failed.

It was a clear afternoon when the attack happened. They were walking in the woods near Buck's territory. The other dogs had been watching them for some time. They hated the strange newcomers, and now was their chance to get rid of the pair. The other dogs had planned to surround them, and one of them would push Curly to the ground, while the others attacked her. They had practiced this before, and they knew that their plan would work.

Buck knew what was going to happen and so did Curly. They had seen the other dogs in the woods before, but Buck thought that they were just passing through. He didn't know that they were planning an attack, and so he didn't prepare a defence. Curly was oblivious to the danger, as she didn't understand the intentions of the other dogs. When Cur"
A2,"There were very old things in the window and Mr Brown liked old things. He went into the shop. 'Good afternoon' said the man in the shop. 'Good afternoon' said Mr Brown. 'Can I look round the shop?' 'Please do.' Mr Brown looked at the things in the shop. He saw an old doll with a sad face. It looked as if it was weeping. There was a beautiful old clock and it was very precious. It could tell the time to the nearest second. There were other things as well, all old. There was a very old man in the shop. He was sitting behind a table with some old silver coins on it. The man spoke to Mr Brown, 'Have you come to buy anything?' said the old man. 'I don't know yet,' said Mr Brown. Mr Brown looked at the clock again. 'I shall have to think,' he said. He wanted to go back to his house and look at all the things he had in his rooms. 'All right,' said the old man, 'you can go and think about it.' 'Thank you,' said Mr Brown. Mr Brown walked out of the shop and went home. He thought about the old things. He wished he had come into the shop with a lot of money. Because he didn't have enough. 'I will come back tomorrow,' he said to himself. 'And then I'll see what I can buy.' On the next day Mr Brown came back to the shop. 'I want to buy the old clock,' he said to the old man. 'It tells the time to the nearest second,' he added. 'It's a beautiful old clock.' 'But you haven't enough money,' said the old man. 'You haven't got any money at all.'"
A2,"Then he climbed out of the water. He hit the fish on the head with a rock. He gave some fish to Peter and he carried the other fish. They took them to Mary and cooked them for breakfast. They couldn't eat them all so they carried some for their dinner later. They all sat and ate the fish for breakfast. Then they all went to their homes.

I will be honest, these sentences are hard to follow, and I am not sure what exactly is being communicated. There are problems with the syntax and the cohesion of these sentences is somewhat lacking. Perhaps a more fluent, fluid version of this text would be something like this:

Then he climbed out of the water and hit one of the fish on the head with a rock. He decided to give some fish to Peter, who carried the rest. They went to Mary's house and cooked the fish for breakfast. They couldn't eat all of the fish, so they took some home for dinner later. Sitting down for breakfast, they enjoyed the fish they had cooked. Afterward, they all went to their respective homes.

Again, I have no idea what kind of ""story"" you are attempting to tell. These sentences seem disjointed and disconnected and do not clearly relate to one another. However, if I were to speculate, it seems like the story is about a person who somehow caught a large quantity of fish (either from a lake, pond, or perhaps ocean), and decides to share their fortune with their friends Peter and Mary, who prepare and consume them. If this is indeed the story you're aiming to tell, the revised sentences I've provided would likely serve you better. I"
A2,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop age 14 Last summer I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. There was a small water tank on the fourth side with an elephant lying down in it. I sat with my family near the back of the square. Then two men came out wearing funny hats. One was a small bald man who spoke to us and showed us some hand signs. The other was a tall man with a strange hat and big glasses. They did some tricks with the elephant – it danced, stood on its head, splashed water and sprayed mud over itself. The tall man climbed on the elephants back and waved a red flag. Suddenly, the elephant leaped into the air several times, almost knocking the tall man off. It was great fun to watch, and we laughed a lot. After the show, we clapped and cheered and the elephant bowed to us with its trunk. Then we took lots of photos with it. Finally, we bought some souvenirs from the small booth selling them. This show was the highlight of my holiday. I still think about it and how much I enjoyed it. I’d love to see it again.

A2,"Mount Kilimanjaro Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are several paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists.

The Marangu path starts in the southwest at Marangu Gate. From there it goes up to Mandara Hut. Next, it goes up through the rain forest and over a bridge crossing the Mweka River. It continues to Horombo Hut. From there it goes on to Kibo Hut. Finally it goes to the top of Kilimanjaro. The Marangu path is quite busy. That's because it is the most popular path.

Kilimanjaro

## Climbing

You should be in good shape to climb Kilimanjaro. You also need the right equipment. For example, you should wear warm clothes and have a warm sleeping bag. You should also have enough water to drink and some food for the climb.

It's also a good idea to bring some money with you. It's important to be able to pay for the help of the guides. That's because you will need them. It's quite difficult to find your way up to the top of the mountain. You can find guides in the park at the base of Kilimanjaro.

## Weather

The weather on Kilimanjaro changes a lot. It can rain in the morning and then be sunny later in the day. That's why you need a rain coat or an umbrella. The temperature is also different depending on where you are. In general"
A2,"Stop the ship! This is too dangerous"" Hayes said to Englehorn. ""We'll get out of here and find better weather"" Englehorn said. ""How much water is under the ship?"" he asked his sailors. Every man on the ship wanted an answer to that question. Englehorn and Hayes didn't know this way. It was true that they hadn't studied their ship much, but they did know that the only time they'd been worried about this was at high tide. ""How much water is under the ship"" Hayes asked again, more desperately. Englehorn was starting to worry and he wasn't even on the ship. He just wanted this expedition over so he could go home. ""There's at least a foot of water under the ship"" one of the men said. ""You see the boat isn't floating, it's just sitting in a small puddle of water. Now the boat is about 6 feet in length and 3 feet deep so that's-"" ""Yeah"" the sailor said, ""that means the water is only an inch over the boat"" It turned out that the sailor was wrong and the ship could only stay afloat in one foot of water. If the water became any deeper, the boat would begin to sink.

Chapter 10: The storm

While the ship was still floating, Englehorn and Hayes decided to go onshore to get water and food supplies for their journey to the east coast. As they approached the shore, they saw that the storm had destroyed the small fishing village. The ship was completely washed away but the buildings still stood. As Englehorn and Hayes went ashore, they were stopped by the village elders who were asking them to"
A2,"Dear Sir I lost my bag on a train last week. I was on the 8.30 a.m. train to Cambridge on 10th May. It is a large blue bag and my name is written on the outside. Have you found this bag? Yours faithfully Mary Johnson Dear Ms Johnson I am pleased to tell you that we have your bag here. It was handed in to our Lost Property Office on the day of your journey. Thankfully, it has been well cared for by the passenger who found it. This is one of the many reasons why it is important that any Lost Property found on our Trains is stored in our Lost Property Office for three days. If it is not collected within this time frame it is then returned to our Lost Property store. Yours faithully Mr David Williams - Lost Property Office.

The writer of the letter is Mr.David Williams who heads the Lost Property Office of the train. He is happy to return the lost property to its owner as that's his job. The lost property is looked after properly till it is collected by the owner. This is a good reason why lost property is kept in the property office for three days, as there is a chance the owner might return to collect it. The owner may be travelling from a place to another for a short period and may come back to get the lost property before their journey.

The writer of the letter seems to have a good work ethic as he makes sure all the lost properties are kept safe and handed over to the owner. He believes in honesty and safety of the lost properties, so he is sure to tell Ms. Johnson that her bag is with them. He treats every owner with respect as he thanks them in his letter.

Mr. Williams, the writer of the letter seems to be a responsible person,"
B1,"The Young Achiever of the Year Kal Kaur Rai has always been interested in fashion and has just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since she was a child she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her hard-working parents who own a supermarket that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She says: ‘I thought I would be a disgrace to them. They would have thought I was silly to go into fashion.’

It wasn’t until she was fifteen years old and received a scholarship from the London College of Fashion, which she applied to without her parent’s knowledge, that she began to study fashion and design. This experience helped to further fuel her passion for fashion.

The following year she applied for Central St. Martin’s in London which is one of the world’s most prestigious fashion colleges and received a scholarship to the same institution. At the age of 16, she enrolled for a one-year art course at St. Martin’s.

By the time she was 18, Kal had won the Fashion Forward competition in Italy and her designs were showcased at the Milan Fashion Show. She has also worked with Roberto Cavalli’s design team in London.

Despite her achievements, Kal was nervous before the Asian Business Awards ceremony and worried that she would not win. When she was announced as the winner, she was in shock and could hardly believe it. Her parents were there, and she was extremely proud to show them what she had achieved. The title of Young Achiever of the Year will certainly help her career and she is now working on launching her own brand.

B1,"THE ICEHOTEL For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. The idea behind this was that the hotel should be built in the winter so that guests could enjoy the winter season and also the spring – when the days got longer and there was still snow and ice to play with. The concept of The Icehotel was first discussed in Jukkasjärvi in December 1988.

Jukkasjärvi is a village in Swedish Lapland, near the Arctic Circle. It is one of the northernmost inhabited places in the world. The temperature in winter drops to minus 30 degrees and can last for months.

In October 1989, after a year of planning and preparation, the first Icehotel was inaugurated in the village of Jukkasjärvi. The hotel was located by the river in the midst of snow and ice, with the river still frozen and the Arctic cold right around the corner. It was a fantastic experience and became the first and only hotel in the world made entirely of ice.

The Icehotel has since then changed location every year as nature has decided. The winter season in the Arctic starts with autumn when the cold weather begins to set in. Snow starts to fall and the first snow falls in November. The snow melts away in May before summer starts.

The Icehotel today is an art hotel made of snow and ice. During spring, snow from the surrounding areas is compacted and transformed into"
B1,"Climbing to the top of Britain Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland and because of its northerly location the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. We'd been there before and knew the ground was very uneven. As we arrived at the base of the mountain, the first thing that struck us was the harsh cold. It was biting and I soon started to shiver. The wind blew cold into my face as we started climbing. At first the walk was fine, but the wind picked up, and then the snow came in swirls across the path and we knew we'd be walking in snow for some of the journey.
  Our climb had started at 8.00 a.m. We'd hoped to reach the top before the afternoon, but as we climbed higher, the weather began to worsen and the visibility became very bad.
 The snow was getting deeper and the wind was stronger, and we had to put on more clothes. We also had to carry our equipment with us, which was very heavy. The climb was becoming very difficult.
  It was now noon. The wind was howling, and the snow came thick and fast. It began to get very cold and it was difficult to walk. We decided to put on extra clothing and even our waterproofs, but it made no difference to the cold.
 I had to keep my mouth shut and breath through my nose to avoid having it freeze.
  By 1.00 p.m. we had climbed a large part of the ridge but the weather was still terrible. The snow fell heavily"
B1,"Being an older student At 32 I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary although I was earning a reasonable amount of money I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. I was aware that my salary was not going to increase much during the rest of my working life. Therefore, after much thinking I decided to go to university to better my career prospects. Going back to the classroom was initially very difficult. I was afraid of not being able to keep up with the workload and I had to learn to be more independent. My family have been very supportive and my parents are very proud of me. My mum helps me with research for my assignments. I am studying social studies at university.

The course is three years long and it is very demanding. As a mature student it is sometimes difficult to fit in with the age of the other students. I find this quite embarrassing as they still consider me as being much older than them even though I am only three years older than most of them. A number of my classmates have found it very difficult to accept me at times. This has sometimes resulted in me feeling isolated in the university environment.

At the age of thirty-three, I will finally complete my degree. I will then have the satisfaction of knowing that I have been dedicated to a course for three years. The feeling of achievement will definitely be worth it, as I have worked very hard to overcome the challenges of balancing my family, job and course.

My ambition is to become a social worker. I know that with my degree I will have the opportunity to make a difference in people's lives. This is important"
B1,"No Title When I injured my back I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. I thought there was an elitist attitude from the organisers. I thought people would be more open to the sport if they had other women to run with. I also felt that I should use my knowledge about running to help the other women. I knew there was a need for a women's only group because I knew a lot of women who wanted to run but felt intimidated by the existing all-male running groups. What do you think, can it be fun? Can it be fun to have an all-female running club? Is it necessary? Well, I think so, and I'm not the only one. Women's running clubs seem to be becoming more and more popular. I think that it is important for women to have opportunities to do exercise where they feel comfortable. There is no reason why exercise shouldn't be fun, and why women can't have the chance to enjoy the social, fitness and health benefits of running. So, what are the main reasons for setting up an all-female running club? What do you think? To encourage more women to participate in sport. To support women's health and fitness. To have a friendly environment where women can feel comfortable. To make running more social and enjoyable. To give women a sense of achievement.

I'm not sure, but... I have some ideas...

1. A women's running club can help promote a more inclusive sports culture for everyone"
B1,"Grass Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are over 9000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. They are the primary food source for billions of people. 

1. Where do grasses grow?
Grasses are found all over the world, from the Arctic to the Antarctic, but the most concentrated growth occurs in the warmer climates.

2. What are grasses?
Grasses are classified as monocotyledons, having one seed leaf that emerges when the seed germinates. They have long, slender leaves growing from a basal rosette that forms a circle around the stem. The roots go down only about 4 inches and then shoot out, forming a mat that helps keep the soil from eroding.

3. How do grasses reproduce?
Grasses reproduce both by seed and vegetatively. They have a short life cycle of 1-5 years.

4. How does grass grow?
Grass grows from the base. They don't have flowers, but they produce flowers in the tops of the plants. They do this because it is easier to spread seeds this way. Seeds are spread by wind and animals.

5. What are grasses used for?
Grass is mainly used as pasture for livestock and for making hay. Grass can be cut and dried or left to wilt and dry naturally.

B1,"Maria Mutola In 1988 Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl in an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. 'We won' she said. 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.' The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha who had encouraged other African athletes learnt about Maria. 'Maria? he said. 'Can you run? Can you jump? And the rest will follow.' She was just 14 and in 1989 won a silver medal in 800m at the World Junior Athletics Championships in the former West Germany. By the time she was 21, she had won three consecutive world titles at 800m and had taken gold in the Sydney Olympics. In 2000 she was appointed goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme. She was the Mozambican flag bearer at the 2000 Summer Olympics, the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2010 she was awarded the prestigious Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year for Lifetime Achievement, making her the first woman of colour to receive the honour. And just to show how far she has come: it was only in 2011 when Maria's father got his first ever pair of shoes. He was 80.

B1,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival an annual nine-day event. The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. The first festival was so popular with residents and tourists that it turned into an annual event.

It is now one of the largest balloon festivals in the world. The event takes place in mid-October and features over 500 hot air balloons of various shapes and sizes which fill the skies over the city for around 90 minutes before sunrise. At this time of day, the conditions are perfect for flying, as there is usually little wind and a cool temperature. The festival is not only about ballooning; it also has plenty of music, food, drink, entertainment and other attractions.

There are also various contests and competitions which pilots take part in, including distance and accuracy contests and ‘the Dawn Patrol’ (where pilots try to hit targets using the glow of their lit balloons). The event also sees many special shaped balloons in the sky, including a balloon which looks like an animal, a camel, or another shaped to look like a famous character, for example, Bugs Bunny and Homer Simpson.

The festival has been held for over 40 years, drawing visitors from all over the world. In 2002 it was voted ‘Best Outdoor Festival’ in the US by USA Today readers. The festival not only provides a spectacle of beautiful and unique hot air balloons but also raises a substantial amount of money for charity every year."

B1,"THE ROCKIES The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America. They start in the North-west but lie only a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies but the best way to see them is to travel by train. The most famous of these railways is probably the Canadian Pacific Railway. This railway was built in the 1880s to join Canada's Atlantic and Pacific coasts. At that time the Rockies were still wild, uninhabited mountains. Today the railroad winds through forests, across bridges, and over valleys, passing through the great parks of Banff and Jasper. The Rockies are known for their unpredictable weather. The clouds can move quickly and snow can fall at any time of year.

B1,"Little Chefs For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.

The Little Chefs organization was set up in 1992 by two friends who were frustrated with the lack of creative, fun cooking programmes for children. The popularity of their cooking course shows no sign of diminishing. So they decided to look for more space and decided to move their cooking school from Fulham to Battersea.

Now that they are in a new location, they also offer evening and weekend courses for adults. For more information contact 020 7622 4862.

For the more advanced students, there are also workshops where they are taught how to make a variety of dishes, using ingredients like game, which they may not have had the opportunity to use before.

So the Little Chefs programmes have helped children, who have always been more interested in food than in playing games, get the chance to learn the fun art of cooking.

For children with a passion for creating culinary delights, Little Chefs offers a chance to have fun and learn at the same time.

B1,"Detective-Inspector Cornish and Chief-Inspector Craddock were discussing the murder at the local police station. 'Mrs Bantry said that Marina Gregg had a ""frozen look""' said Cornish. 'Did she see someone on the stairs? There were two people from America - Ardwyck Fenn and Lola Brewster a film star. Fenn appeared drunk, but Lola Brewster was charming as you can imagine. Perhaps Mrs Bantry might know. I understand that Lola Brewster went out at 1.30 am.'

Chief Inspector Craddock replied, 'We have questioned Mrs Bantry already, and she was quite unhelpful. The dead man is Colonel Lacey. He was found in the dining-room with his throat cut.'

The above is an extract from a short story by Agatha Christie. It gives a flavour of the type of mystery that could appear in a story by Christie, and sets the scene for the tale that follows. It is, of course, typical of Christie's work. It features an investigation, suspects, clues, and a clever deduction by the detective to unmask the murderer.

I love Agatha Christie and I was pleased when I saw that there was a challenge to read as many of her books as you can in a year. I am only reading a few, but I wanted to post this up to make sure that I can look back and see which ones I have read during this challenge.

She was running past the half-open door of one of the rooms when she saw someone inside. It was Mr. Crawford!

Virginia was astonished.

""I'm so surprised to see you here, Mr. Crawford,"" she said.

He got up and came to meet her.

""Hello, Miss Virginia, I am expecting you, that's why I'm here,"" he said, with his usual manner of speaking with her.

The young lady, a little embarrassed, went into the room with him.

""What's the matter, Miss Virginia?"" he asked, looking at the torn skirt.

""I was running up the stairs, I'm afraid I was doing it too fast, and the skirt of my riding habit got caught on a branch of the tree and tore.""

""And you have decided to mend it, that's good,"" said Mr. Crawford, with a strange smile, but then the sound of footsteps upstairs made him raise his voice.

""You can bring me some of the material that matches, and I will do the mending for you,"" he said, without waiting for an answer.

""No,"" replied Virginia, ""it is very unlucky that Mr. Crawford is here, that was my first thought. I'd prefer to mend it myself. I will do it right away.""

B1,"Winter Driving Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow waiting to send you off the road. These conditions cause drivers to have to be even more cautious. Driving in the snow and ice is so difficult that you might want to stay home, and that is the best thing to do if you are not a very confident driver. You have to make sure to check the weather forecast and plan a good time to be out and coming back home before the bad weather. If you need to be out and drive, make sure the car is in proper condition, the windshield wipers are functioning well, the defrost and heater are working, and the snow chains for the tires are on. During driving, keep your speed down and allow plenty of following distance. Slow down when coming to an intersection. Watch for pedestrians and other vehicles. Winter tires are highly recommended, and make sure to clear snow and ice off your car. Remember to put more distance between the car ahead and you, and don't be aggressive while driving. It's best to take your time and make sure to get to your destination safely.

Always plan ahead to be safe and use the most appropriate route based on the current weather conditions. When you plan your trip, try to avoid any unnecessary travel. If possible, don’t drive at night, and don’t leave home unless you really have to. If you are on a long journey, you must stay at a motel overnight. If you must travel at night, prepare the vehicle with everything needed and be extra"

She was discovered by the driver after he had completed a trip of over 500 kilometres. It was the end of a long day. Bo was in a shocking state; exhausted and filthy. Bo’s owner was incredibly relieved to find her and Bo was just so happy to be home.

Bo had been missing for two weeks. The 6 year old black and white cat had gone exploring, never expecting to be found in the back of a furniture removal van. Bo had snuggled down amongst the furniture and slept through a trip from Wynnum, in Brisbane, to New South Wales. She finally arrived in her home city of Melbourne with the driver none the wiser. Fortunately, the driver had taken a wrong turn and Bo’s owner spotted her.

The story of Bo the explorer will feature on The Animal Rescue Site.

The next day the snow started to go away and Emma was excited. She knew that soon they would all be out and about again. Emma liked being out and about with Mr Elton and Harriet. She couldn't wait to go out and about again but she also wanted to see Mr Knightley again. Mr Knightley was very pleasant to be with. He would come to Hartfield a lot when Mr Woodhouse wasn't there.

B1,"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST Hypatia was born in Alexandria in Egypt in 370 A.D. For many centuries she was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books. Hypatia's father was director of Alexandria University and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual as most women then had few opportunities to study. Hypatia herself studied mathematics, astronomy and philosophy and became the world's first female Professor of Mathematics at the Neo-Platonist school in Alexandria. It's said that the Neo-Platonist philosophy that Hypatia taught was a mix of Plato's ideas on philosophy and Pythagoras's work on mathematics. Hypatia was a brilliant teacher and many students came from near and far to learn from her. She was also highly respected for her wisdom and was often consulted by the authorities in Alexandria on various matters. Hypatia was eventually murdered by a mob of Christian fanatics in 415 A.D. This happened in a church where she had gone for her safety. Although she was not a Christian, she was considered a heretic by the Christian fanatics. Hypatia was buried in Alexandria but her works were destroyed by the mob. The ancient world, and Alexandria in particular, was a center of science and scholarship, and Hypatia was an important figure in this world. Her story is told in the book The Woman Who Lost her Head by Charles Kingsley.

At my first ballet class I was nervous as I didn’t know anyone. Everyone gathered round asking me questions all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. One of the students took me to a corner where she showed me how to stand properly. She introduced me to the ballet master and gave me a piece of paper with all the names of the students in the class. I was very worried that I would forget them all. I didn’t have any ballet shoes so I had to wait for the teacher to arrive to borrow some from her. She gave me a pair that were a little too big, but she showed me how to keep them from falling off. During the class the teacher was strict but not aggressive. The other students were very nice. They are my classmates, friends, and tutors. Ballet is my passion so I want to be the best and achieve my dreams.

B1,"Sharks  Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks do not have any natural predators.

In our stories we are going to learn a little more about sharks, and also how they live in the big ocean.

1. Who are Sharks? 2. How Do Sharks Hunt? 3. How Do Sharks live and what do they eat? 4. What is a shark?



1. Who Are Sharks? Sharks are very strange creatures that live in the ocean. They have pointed noses, a rough skin and powerful body. Some sharks are even dangerous to people! But the fact is that there is no bigger fish in the ocean than the shark. They have survived all these millions of years in spite of the efforts of man to catch them. Sharks have teeth like daggers in their mouths and they can attack their prey very fast, in just one second! Sharks also have excellent eyesight and can move quickly.

2. How Do Sharks Hunt? Sharks are carnivorous animals. They are always hungry and they eat meat. They eat various kinds of fish, fishes like sardines, anchovies and mackerels. And they also eat squids and crustaceans. They hunt mostly at night. They feel when their prey is nearby, they swim quickly and attack with their sharp teeth. Sharks also hunt in a group.

But 6000 holidaymakers still go there annually to visit what is probably Europe's most unusual accommodation. In this hotel you eat drink and sleep in rooms made of ice. If you want you can even get married in one. The hotel has 46 rooms. All are carved from a wall of ice 50cm thick 45m wide and 18m high. The ceiling is snow and the floors are ice on which guests walk barefoot. Every year the whole thing has to be melted down and re-carved into a new shape. Some years it is a medieval castle other years it may be a palace or an igloo. A chapel has an ice altar and ice lectern. Guests are provided with warm sleeping bags in ice beds but as winter temperatures outside can be -35° C ice has to be heated with blowers. At least three metres of snow also has to be shovelled away every day so there is space for guests to move about. The hotel is in an area in the Arctic circle which is one of the last places on the earth where people can see the spectacular natural phenomenon called the Aurora Borealis - the northern lights. The hotel can be seen from space as the earth rotates. People have been coming to Jukkasjarvi for many years to go dog sledding and snowshoeing. There is also an ice sculpture park nearby. And for Christmas many of them stay in one of the 20 specially carved ice rooms which have a window showing the snowy landscape outside. There is also a reception area and sauna in the complex but no restaurant because there is no

B1,"No Title The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six"" says Margaret Porter a violinist and music teacher. ""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret who lives in London prefers to take pupils at three and four although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds.

Around the age of three children usually have enough coordination, concentration and listening skills to learn the violin. By the age of four children will be able to understand what they are being taught. By the age of five children's attention may not be as good as adults so extra effort may be needed to keep them focused.

Violins are not a toy and should never be treated as such. It's important to start learning violin at the right age so the child can learn properly. It's important to show them how to treat the instrument correctly. ""Violins are expensive and there is so much to learn about playing one"" Margaret continues ""We must take care of our instruments and take our lessons seriously"" she says.

Margaret is a good teacher and takes her job seriously, she can understand why some parents might wish to wait before they pay for lessons, ""Sometimes I'll take children on a trial basis to see how they cope."" she continues ""But I still think three to six is the best age.""

It's the children who have parents and/or grandparents who play instruments themselves who usually start earlier, they are given a violin as a present and are naturally very excited to play along with the adults.

Children who start too young may have difficulty grasping the concepts of music and stringed instruments. They may not have the necessary motor skills required to learn a musical instrument"

B1,"SAMUEL PEPYS The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting description of everyday life in England between 1660 and 1669. Pepys writes about important news stories of the time like disease an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames and the Great Fire of London. He also writes about less important daily things like what he ate and what he saw.

Here is the entry for Tuesday 2nd September 1666, which describes a busy day during the Great Fire of London: ""This morning, about a quarter before eight, I was called, and found the house all burning, and a great fire in the King’s house, near to us, that we were in some danger. I went into my lord’s chamber, and got my wife and her maid up, and had them out at Lord Brouncker’s house, where I had left my son Tom and my maid there; and I sent a boy of mine to Westminster for my stock. I had a great loss in my books; for all my library, in the gallery, being wooden, was all up in smoke, with some pictures; and my house and office, also some of the stores and records of the Navy, and all the King’s ships' money that was in my custody, amount to about £15,000 in gold and silver, all melted down. I sat and saw them all in a flames. My own and my wife’s jewelery, of great value, also all gone. I have lost about £140 in ready money, and a great deal in plate, to say nothing of my books. The loss by the fire in my house, of household furniture, clothes"
B1,"The History of Shoes In the past importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today but other materials such as silk plastic or cotton are also popular depending on what is in fashion.

The 1st pair of high heeled shoes was created in China during the 13th century and only worn by the Emperor. The high heel had a practical use for horse riding, which enabled the wearer to stay in the stirrup if their foot slipped through the stirrup. The high heel shoes are very expensive as they are hand made and only produced by a few people who still have this skill.

In the 19th century rubber was introduced which meant shoes could have elastic laces and soles which were not leather. Today’s modern trainers (or sneakers in America) were invented in 1892 by an American man named William R. Johnson. He made them out of Kangaroo leather and rubber for the soles. This material gave them their cushioned feel.

Throughout history, shoe styles have changed dramatically but their basic function remains the same – to protect and support the foot from the ground. The ancient Egyptians considered shoes to be a status symbol and only royalty wore them. It wasn’t until the 18th century when footwear became widely available and affordable.

The Roman army required their soldiers to wear shoes made of leather, while the Greeks wore sandals for most occasions.

In the 16th century, it became fashionable for ladies to wear high-heeled shoes with wide toes, called chopines or c"
B1,"The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the ‘famous Ghan’ which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known above all for being late. The name Ghan is derived from a name given to the Afghani camel drivers who in the 1860s first traversed this desert crossing. This journey is a great introduction to Australia’s diverse climates, cultures and landscapes.

### Accommodations on The Ghan

The Ghan train offers two accommodation classes, Gold Service and Red Service. The journey can be done in style in the private Gold Service cabins which offer more space, a personal attendant and fine dining with Australian wines. The Red Service cabins are more basic and affordable, offering good value. Both services provide air-conditioned comfort and a restaurant car for dining.

### Route of The Ghan

The journey begins in the Northern Territory capital of Darwin, then heads south to Katherine and Alice Springs in the heart of the Australian Outback. From there the Ghan heads southwards across the deserts of South Australia, and after a run along the coast it finally reaches its southern terminus of Adelaide.

### Journey Time and Highlights

The journey takes four days and three nights. Among the highlights are the Katherine Gorge, the red centre of Australia, the ghost town of Marla and the abandoned railway station of Finke. The train crosses over 200 bridges and passes through over 1,100 kilometres of some of the driest landscapes on earth"
B1,"Henry Ford Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863 but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen he began work as a mechanic and in 1893 he built his first car. After he had driven it 1500 kilometres he sold it and built two bigger cars.

In 1903 he built the Ford Motor Company. 28 years later, he stopped making cars in order to work for peace and his belief in the goodness of people. Ford died in 1947 and left his great company to his son, Henry Ford II.

Henry Ford’s most important contributions to the world were in the automotive industry and to manufacturing. By inventing new ways to produce and assemble cars, Ford lowered the price of cars for most Americans. This mass production method is still used today.

Ford’s work in manufacturing extended beyond the automotive industry. He also developed Fordlandia, a large rubber tree plantation in Brazil. His methods helped transform the way products were made.

He was famous for his belief that businesses should give employees fair wages. Ford’s $5 work day was introduced in 1914 and many workers were thrilled to be earning five times what they had been making a few years before.

Henry Ford’s achievements have left a lasting mark on the world. His vision for the automotive industry has helped shape the modern world. He believed that technology could be used to improve people’s lives, and he worked to make that belief a reality.

Ford’s belief in the power of technology extended beyond the automotive industry. He believed in the power of information and was an early advocate for the internet. He"

B1,"No Title A month ago I had no idea that on a Saturday afternoon in November I'd be hanging 30 metres above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me and realised why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The next day we took an hour-and-a-half bus ride through the mountains to the rock-climbing site. We spent the morning getting equipment and training. By midday I was hoisting myself up a cliff face. The hardest part was getting over the fear of falling. My climbing mate Matt had been doing this for a while. He told me to look around. The scenery was beautiful. The hardest part was getting over the fear of falling. I have always been afraid of heights, but I wasn't going to let that stop me. So I took a breath, started to climb, and let myself relax. For a while, I went slowly, carefully using all my strength. But as I climbed higher, I felt stronger. At that moment, I was happy to be climbing. I was also thankful that the activity centre's owner had put me at ease about falling. He told me it wouldn't happen because I had the right equipment. That's when I knew I wanted to do more rock-climbing in the future. Matt and I descended the rocks. On the bus ride back, I realised that what we'd experienced was much more than a weekend adventure. It was a life experience. As I looked through the bus window at the beautiful mountains, I knew it would be hard to say goodbye to this place.

B1,"Letter to the Newport Evening News On Saturday afternoon I left my handbag on the bus. In it were my cheque book address book and my purse which contained about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realised what I had done it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old I was a long way from home and I was quite worried. But what really frightened me was when I telephoned First Buses later that evening to report my loss and I was told that they had no way of tracking lost property. I think it's outrageous. I'm sure I wasn't the first to lose something on one of your buses but it won't be the last. I have to tell you that First Buses has lost 30 years of custom from me because I can't trust it anymore to look after my personal possessions. Now what are you going to do about it? If nothing, then we'll have to see what compensation is available at law. I should have expected much better from you.

Sincerely Mrs D.J. Patterson

Newport, South Wales, UK.

The Newport Evening News have not replied to Mrs Patterson's letter. If they had replied and said that they had taken her complaint seriously and would put a new policy in place with regard to lost property the situation would have been resolved satisfactorily from the Newport Evening News' point of view.

They could have reassured Mrs Patterson that they have put in place new tracking measures for lost property. This would have shown that they take their passengers' concerns seriously and would have reassured other passengers that their personal possessions would be safe.

B1,"Shopping for furniture A report by Dave Worthington Homestyle a new furniture shop was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers including a leather sofa on sale for £45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). There was also a TV for just £5 (and only from 8 am to 9 am). This is typical of what Mr Homestyle himself described as 'A typical frenzied mid-Night madness.' The shop was open 24 hours so you can buy furniture at any time, however, it was still closed last night. You just have to find a better shop where the furniture is more reasonably priced. If you are looking for furniture, you might like to know that Mr Homestyle is now planning to open up a new shop in your neighbourhood sometime soon. 27 May 2008 Morning 58 083 2431101.

B1,"The Eden Project Since it opened the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK’s most popular tourist attractions. At first sight the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. From tropical plants and rainforests to the Mediterranean shrubland, visitors are able to experience climate change for themselves. But the Eden Project is not only a tourist attraction: it is also a venue for conferences, performances, weddings, exhibitions and, of course, educational programmes. There are also various horticultural courses and programmes such as Planting Design, Green Technology and Planting Design for Business. The Eden Project offers opportunities for everyone, both within the complex and without. For example, they have a special section on their website encouraging young people to study STEM subjects and offering tips for their future careers. The Eden Project in numbers 8.5 million visitors since opening; 2,200 hectares of site area; 360 plant species in the biomes; 37 000 tonnes of compost per year used at the Eden Project; 900 employees.

B1,"NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH AN OPEN UNIVERSITY DEGREE Like any other university the Open University can give you a degree. However you don't have to stop working to study. It can also open up a whole variety of interests. If you have never studied before you will enjoy the special new pleasure of increasing your knowledge. If you are already well qualified you will find that studying in this way has its own particular advantages and interest. A good example is the person who has perhaps already graduated in science but wants to study for a part-time law degree. Or a student who works as an engineer but has always been fascinated by the theatre, or a manager who wants to study politics. The Open University can offer them the chance to explore these interests. The Open University is also useful if you want to improve your qualifications to get a better job. If you have a good degree you may still find new areas of study to interest you. You can study with the Open University in order to increase your chances of getting a job. For example, if you have no background in computing but are faced with the challenge of using new computers in your own job, you can take a part-time computing course. The Open University also allows you to study any number of subjects at the same time. You can take an arts degree and a science degree at the same time, for example. This allows you to see how different subjects relate to one another, and it also means you can get a broader education. Studying in this way also allows you to build up a lot of different skills. It can help you become more creative, for example. It can also allow you to be more flexible in your thinking. The Open University offers you courses by television and computer. So you can study wherever you are. The courses are"
B1,"JAZZ By Katie Atkins aged 14 I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools – and our band won! Each band had their own costumes ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly-coloured T-shirts. We played a variety of jazz songs such as ‘Hit The Road, Jack’ and ‘Caravan’ and improvised our own ideas as we played. During the two weeks leading up to the competition, we practised our parts and the whole performance every day for at least two hours each session. The winner’s trophy had a beautiful trumpet inscribed on it. The moment it was placed on the table, we cheered and hugged! I was so proud to be a part of the winning team. My jazz band friends had never felt so enthusiastic and we couldn’t wait for the next performance. Jazz is a fantastic music to play and is so much fun when you perform as a team. I hope the competition inspires other students to join their school’s jazz band.

B1,"San Francisco San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it was discovered by land rather than by sea. However Spanish settlers were quick to realise the potential of San Francisco Bay and they began to colonise it. A town was established in the 1830s, and by the 1840s San Francisco was already a booming trading post. In 1849 San Francisco was inundated with gold prospectors heading to the gold mines in the nearby Sierra Nevada mountains. The city quickly grew to become one of the West Coast's greatest and most diverse cities.

The Bay Area and the city San Francisco is a major port in North America. San Francisco's beautiful setting, mild climate, economic strength, and its cultural vibrancy, make it an exciting city for business and pleasure. The bay area of San Francisco is home to some of the most highly regarded educational and research institutions in the country. Also it is the home of Silicon Valley, a technology centre that's produced a string of tech industry giants, including Google, Hewlett Packard and Apple. It's not hard to see why so many people love to live here.

Location: San Francisco lies 81 miles north of San Jose.
Size: San Francisco covers an area of 119.6 square miles.
Population: San Francisco has a population of approximately 775,000 people.
Climate: There is an average of 260 sunny days each year.

B1,"STAMP COLLECTING - IT’S A HOBBY THAT CAN GROW AND GROW Millions of people of all ages enjoy a hobby which is both interesting and fun. And every year more and more people start a stamp collection of their own and discover an interest which can last a lifetime. Starting your collection is easy because stamps are everywhere. In fact, it is almost impossible to go anywhere these days without the presence of stamps. Not only do stamps exist in the traditional forms of postal stamps, but they appear on cards, envelopes, letters and stationery too. By collecting stamps, you will not only learn about history, geography and the art of design, but you will have fun and possibly even make new friends with similar interests. The world is truly yours to explore through a hobby that has been enjoyed by millions of people for years. To start your collection, there are three basic steps to consider. 1) Start a basic collection: Choose your speciality area and then try to collect as many of the stamps in that area as possible. This can include a focus on country, specific era of history or a certain type of stamp subject such as birds, flowers or architecture. 2) Organize your collection: Once you have a set of stamps you would like to begin collecting, you need a means of storing and organizing them. Consider investing in an album or binder specifically designed for stamp storage. In this album or binder, you can place sheets of clear cellophane or stamp covers to protect the stamps. Another option could be stamp cards or pages which provide space for a description of each stamp and its history. 3) Start a study of stamp history and catalogues: As your collection grows, you might find yourself wanting to learn more"

B1,"New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role 'I never expected to spend some of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I’d only ever acted at school but I'd loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her. Of course, when I was at school, I never thought of acting as a career, but I thought it might be fun to try it out and see if I could do it. Luckily, they liked my audition. I had a fantastic time playing Polly but it was hard work. The Finnegans was a six-part series and I was in it every day, sometimes twelve hours a day. The workload was enormous and I had to be extremely organized. It was tough to juggle work and college commitments.

'The Finnegans is a wonderful book, full of humour and drama, and I am really happy that I have been given the chance to bring Polly to life. I have been a bit worried about how it would be received because it was very much a classic and it's hard to know whether contemporary viewers will appreciate it.

'What I love about Polly, as opposed to the other characters in the book, is that she has this wild innocence and excitement about her that really appeals to people. She has an endearing energy about her and a way of looking at things that makes you want to smile. The story is about the trials and tribulations of a poor family and it has this great warmth and depth about it.

B1,"Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car recycling wine bottles not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out. I want to be clear about one thing right from the start - it wasn't my idea to become the BBC's ethical man. My producers thought of it. In our first meeting we had our first argument - I wasn't keen on the title but I didn't really have a choice. You see, I already had the job of presenting the BBC's Newsnight programme. It was one of those classic jobs where you spend two weeks in the field reporting on the most serious stories of the day, and then one evening sitting in the studio chair, surrounded by a bunch of people who could be your best friends, but when the camera is rolling all bets are off. When we are on air, we are fierce competitors - we need to be, it is a huge responsibility. So there was my problem. As a news presenter, I was expected to be neutral, but I was also a husband, father, brother and son - and I'm not neutral in my family. What to do? I don't think I found the answer really. That is, not until I went to China. I'm a great fan of Chinese culture but I've always been puzzled by its contradictions. A communist country with a capitalist spirit, a society that promotes materialism, but does it through the medium of a thousand ancient philosophies. I wanted to understand how people square these contrasts in their day-to-day lives, so I decided to spend a month touring the country, looking at the great issues: How does it square a belief in human"
B1,"We went to the park. We knew of fifty-two sons in prison. We made a circle of lights one for each son. People stopped to look at the dancing lights and came to ask about our campaign. By the time it was dark our camp had grown to more than fifty women. All of us standing for the freedom of our sons.

Nora

The idea for this exhibition was born in 2009 when I was working on an assignment for the Guardian newspaper about imprisoned women.  One of the women I spoke to asked me if I had any sons.  When I told her I had five, she replied “You have a lot of work to do.”

On my return from Egypt I asked Nora if she’d like to come to the UK to speak. We organised a tour together, and on 8th May 2010 we held an event for Nora at the Amnesty International headquarters, in London. It went very well, around 40 people came. At the end of the event people asked how they could help, how they could get involved, and asked if they could buy the photographs from the exhibition.

My next challenge was to find a way to continue the project after Nora returned to Egypt. I wanted to make the voices and stories of these imprisoned women more widely heard, and find a way to continue helping their families. One way was to raise awareness, another was to raise funds to support the families of political prisoners.

It occurred to me that with this model of exhibition and collaboration we could help many more families, and at the same time highlight the plight of these women.

So we continued our journey, with exhibitions"

B1,"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod which means 'far distant place'. This town and the surrounding country was so inhospitable and rugged that it needed something to provide supplies and messages to its isolated population. Dogsledding was the method of choice. Dog teams could travel overland whereas ships could not, and they could be loaded and unloaded much quicker. But things changed. In the 1920s the trains took over the supply of goods. The airplane made its appearance and soon became a vital link to the distant communities in the bush. Trains were faster, cheaper and more dependable than the dog team. A lot of dogs became useless and many sled drivers (mushers) found themselves jobless. In 1925 there was a terrible diphtheria epidemic and a number of children in the town of Nome were affected. The serum to treat the disease was being transported to Nome by train, when the track was blocked by snow. There was no time to spare, and the only way to save the children was by dogsled. Dr. Curtis Welch, and twenty dogs and their musher, dog sled driver, Leonhard Seppala, set off from Nenana. They travelled 800 miles in 5 and a half days and saved the children. This event proved the worth of the dogs. In the 1960s Joe Redington, Jr. from Anchorage, had a dream to rev"
B1,"No Title When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976 my only object was to earn enough to feed my children. Today 'The Body Shop' is an international company rapidly growing all around the world. In the years since we began I have learned a lot. I would like to share this learning with you.

Firstly, I am convinced that if our businesses do not respect our human values we will one day go the way of the dinosaurs. I believe with all my heart that there is a future for our businesses, but only if we respect the things that are most important to us, only if we go back to basics - to the most basic of all - respect for life.

Our greatest need is for a new way of doing business - a new business ethic. The old business model, the one that drives competition and maximises profit at any cost, has to go. It is destroying the environment, driving people to greed, and driving animals and people out of their natural habitats. It is time to do away with the idea of infinite growth because growth in a finite world will lead us only to ruin and disaster.

In the 1950s and '60s there were only a few people who believed that we could do better than the way we were running our businesses. We could do better by caring for the world, its people and animals. Today this idea has grown. Today there are thousands of businesses - small, medium and large - that are now working in a way that makes people and the planet come first.

A new business ethic that puts people and planet first is not just good business practice - it is a moral duty. There are many examples today"
B1,"Rock Band Two years agoour 14-year-old s onBen asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At firstwe were very much against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time' Ben argued ’and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end we gave in.

At the time I was unaware of how much I would enjoy the activity of playing the drums myself and have actually learned how to play Rock Band.

Last weekend we took Ben's drums to his auntie’s birthday party and he and my niece, a drumming fanatic who studies drums and guitar, had great fun.

This weekend we are taking his drums to a party for our nephew and niece. We are wondering if it would be inappropriate to do so, as they have a very noisy birthday present, a quadbike.

Any advice is welcome.

B.N., Scotland.

Dear B.N.

I feel sure that drumming at a noisy party wouldn’t make things any worse and might make things a bit more fun. The quadbike seems an odd gift for a party – particularly if there are a lot of children present. Quadbikes can be dangerous for young children. Do ask them about how it is going to be used and if they really want it, rather than expecting them to have a good time with it without being told what to do.

I remember at Christmas my mother-in-law bought us a set of drums for the children. It made a terrible racket and I wondered why on earth we had been given such a present. However, after the initial shock and the complaint to mother-in-law,"

B1,"ZOOS People began to keep animals in zoos over 3000 years ago when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally. 75 per cent of the world's top zoos are in the USA. The most famous in the USA is the Central Park Zoo in New York City, which was established in 1864 and contains around 1400 animals. Zoos are very popular in Europe. France has one of the oldest zoos in Europe, the Jardin des Plantes, which was established in 1793. One of the oldest zoos in the world is the Tiergarten Schoenenberg in Vienna, which was established in 1752. The largest zoo in the world is the Beijing Zoo in China, which has an area of 860 hectares and houses over 5000 animals. The second largest zoo in the world is the Phoenix Park Zoo in Dublin, Ireland. Some people think that zoos can help to protect and conserve endangered species, whereas others believe that the animals should be in the wild.

B1,"MONEY What is money? The pound the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book a huge bag of sweets or a couple of cinema tickets. But if there were a shortage of pound notes, the price would go up, and the number of things you could buy for that money would go down. The same is true for a country as a whole. If a country makes more things than people in that country or people in other countries want to buy. It can use this 'surplus' of goods to buy goods and services from other countries that want to buy more than the things they make. If, however, a country makes fewer things than people want to buy it is said to have a 'deficit' of goods.

### Money and Deficit

As a country with a deficit in the balance of payments, it will have to import goods and services to make up the shortfall. This is usually paid for with a shortage of money or by taking on debt. In the past, when countries had a large deficit of goods and services, they often used gold to 'pay the bill'. But since the Second World War countries have relied on money and debt to pay for these imports. This is how countries like the UK and the US have been able to acquire goods from around the world that they couldn't make themselves.

The way that countries choose to make up this deficit varies. For example, during the 1990s, the UK government decided to try to deal with its deficit by limiting how much money it let into the country. This means that"
B1,"Anna’s new school It’s been a very exciting week as we’ve just moved into our new school building! It’s an amazing place as the builders have used wood for the whole thing just like in our old school but it’s also one of the first in my country designed to be really environmentally friendly. To top it all, we have three floors! So we now have a large playground where we can do all sorts of things when the weather is nice (and also when it isn’t thanks to our lovely and warm classroom) like the one you see in this picture.

I just want to share what Anna tells me about her new school because when I first visited I noticed how different it was to anything we have back in the UK. In particular, I loved how the children were being really helpful with the younger kids, showing them where to sit and helping them to settle in.

Anna also noticed how all her friends were just as eager as her to see her again. I think the school must have done a great job helping the children to prepare for the move. And how lovely it is to have so many friends who’re so caring!

As we came in the building, the teachers welcomed all the children and their parents, with a big smile on their faces. They helped Anna settle in her new classroom and showed her where everything was. What struck me the most is that they kept a lovely drawing she made before the move, which now hangs on the wall of their new classroom. What a lovely touch, don’t you think?

And so, Anna has started in her new school with the enthusiasm and excitement she had in the first days of school ever since she was a little baby. How I wish the same to all those"

It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 metres. The Skywalk is 40 feet above the edge of the canyon and 1200 feet above the bottom of the canyon. The Skywalk is made of glass so you can see through it. The Grand Canyon Skywalk is the only glass-bottomed bridge in the whole of America. In order for visitors to enter the Grand Canyon and walk across the Skywalk they have to pay. There are also rules that they must follow. They are not allowed to wear high heels or open toed shoes because the glass is very cold. In order to keep the Skywalk clean and safe for everybody to walk across, visitors are not allowed to chew gum or smoke.

B1,"Watering the Desert  It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh Morocco. It doesn’t happen frequently and when it does the city’s water pipes can’t manage the sudden floods which turn the streets into rivers. But as many winters have remained dry in recent times when the rain does come it is welcomed by the local people. So how does this happen at all if it’s so dry in Marrakesh. The answer lies in the surrounding mountain ranges to the North of Marrakesh. During the winter season these mountains hold the rain and slowly release it in the summer months keeping the gardens green and well watered.

### Morocco Marrakesh

Marrakesh in Morocco is one of the most famous cities in the Maghreb. Marrakesh is situated near the foothills of the snow-capped Atlas Mountains. It is a former capital city of Morocco and is today the second largest city in the country after Casablanca. The city is also often regarded as a tourist city because of the various cultural influences that have made Marrakesh what it is. These cultural influences include, Arabic, Berber and Andalusian and Spanish culture. Marrakesh has been a trading and meeting place for various merchants and traders for centuries.

### Marrakesh Gardens

Many of Marrakesh’s gardens are famous not just within Morocco but across the world. Marrakesh gardens contain a variety of exotic plants that were brought in from different parts of the world, thanks to the city’s historical and cultural connections with various nations. There are public and private gardens in Marrakesh that attract tourists and local visitors. Some of the gardens are situated"

Three years ago Alan Kath and Gareth joined the circus. 'People laugh when we tell them' says Kath. 'Sometimes they are in fits'. It is hard work though. 'I know what the circus is like' says Alan 'I am used to a hard working environment from engineering but the circus is very demanding and very tiring especially for someone of my age'. Gareth enjoys every moment of his job 'I love this life. I do get some teasing from my brothers though. They can't understand why I chose this career instead of following what they did'.

B1,"Little Chefs For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.

The classes, taught by two professional chefs, offer a great way to keep kids out of trouble. Their aim is to get children into the habit of cooking for their families. This is good for two reasons. First, it frees up some parents who have no time for cooking and secondly, it is a way of getting kids to eat healthier.

Some children find the course so successful that they ask for it as a gift. One child went on to cook a main course meal for 20 people as part of a school project.

Besides learning how to cook, these young chefs learn about food, food processing, food hygiene, menu planning, how to buy the right ingredients, the cost and the history of the food that they prepare.

So the next time you come across one of these little chefs in a restaurant, you can enjoy not only the food, but also feel good to know where the food comes from. You will know that it has come from a child who has learned the skills to make the food they are eating.

Baking Bread Bread-making is a fun activity to do with children and can be a great way to introduce them to food. Making bread is a good way to get them to develop an interest in healthy, homemade foods and can teach them how to enjoy making and eating food.

With children as young as three years old, it is easy"

B1,"No Title Some people have complained about this year's collection New Writing 3 although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is pretty amazing? Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. However, there are also some equally as good and as engaging pieces from up and coming authors which are equally as enjoyable. The non-fiction section features some very interesting articles about the war in Kosovo and the Holocaust, though these do not exactly provide light holiday reading. For me, the most interesting pieces were the plays, the poetry and the science fiction, which I feel were some of the best parts of the book. There is plenty of talent out there but there is a problem with the publishing industry. If you go to any bookshop and pick up a novel, it is most likely to be one of those by established writers. But as there is an infinite variety of human experience, you can never know whether you would like a book by a writer of whom you have never heard of. The New Writing series is designed to let new authors be heard and to give them the recognition which they deserve. With this in mind, I think this collection is a great success.

What's not to like?

This is a collection of fiction, poetry, essays, and plays by new writers, and is well worth the cover price of £6.99. My favorite pieces were Lydia Netzer's ""Tuesday Evenings"", which depicts the life of a woman in an unhappy marriage who takes up painting for the first time, and ""Things I have Lear"

I was excited to be in an environment that was a departure from my daily routine. 'My day was exciting from start to finish. I had lunch with Fiona the features director, I got to read all the latest fashion and I met the team who are so lovely and fun. I really felt I connected with the magazine - it was very interesting to meet the people behind the scenes and to talk to them about their jobs.  'I talked to their art director about zoo design. They were very interested in the architecture of the animal enclosures and how the zoo plans to keep animals as comfortable as possible. I explained how we think about the environment, and what animals need in terms of space, plants and the temperature they need. 'The art director said the magazine often puts together features on architecture so she was very interested to meet someone who works in that area. I was also surprised that she was not aware of the zoo-keeping profession. The staff were interested in my work, and they kept asking me about it.

B2,"Onto a winner Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse two bushy-bearded brothers in their forties are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico USA and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. ‘Battleship’ – their favourite game, says Dave. Theirs is a game so addictive that it has spawned a multi-million-dollar film. The Lagasse brothers loved it as children and they love it now. It may be simple – even a bit silly. But it has led them to success. It gave them the idea for the game they now manufacture. So much so that they are expanding, planning to take over the world with what they call: Beard Season. Dave and Norm Lagasse grew up in the family home in Santa Fe – but there were no jobs so, after college, they started a marketing agency. But they soon found that the ‘bearded culture’ was not being tapped into and they knew that their own beards – two bushy beards – could help make them stand out. Dave has the beard, which he admits can be a pain. It needs a shampoo all of its own, not to mention hours of maintenance every day. ‘It’s a way of life,’ says Dave, as the brothers’ beards dominate the room. They started out with a simple idea, to create a beard balm, and then began to develop a range of beard products, including beard oil, beard wax and a beard brush.

Five minutes later Dr Kemp pulled down the window again and returned to his writing desk. His pen scratched, a page filled with words, and he glanced at his pocketwatch. There were still three hours before dawn. He would do this every evening while the storm raged. And the storm will rage another day. This was only an introduction. It was only the beginning. The storm had started to rage before the rain had come and before the winds had blown. The storm was inside him too. Dr Kemp.

B2,"We are being bombarded with advertisements all the time and a lot of them are targeted at young people. Smaller children apart from spending their own pocket money can also influence what their parents buy so many TV ads are created with kids in mind. For example adverts for drinks feature cartoon animals. These advertisements appeal to us because they seem to show us something we want and need at the time. They use things that are familiar to us, like characters from films or cartoons that we like. The adverts are also full of bright colours, lively music, and are usually very short and repetitive. This makes it easy for us to remember the product and what it does. Most important of all, the adverts usually show that the product will improve our social and physical lives. Ads for food, drink or clothing are designed to make us think that having them will make us more popular or successful. Ads for medicines and cosmetics suggest that using them will improve our health and looks. The companies who make these products have spent a lot of money to convince us that their products are better than those of their rivals. Advertising is everywhere and can be difficult to escape. Most people believe that the amount of advertising there is has increased in the last few years.

Advertisements for cigarettes, alcohol and some other harmful products may be shown on TV, but they are less common than before. There is a lot of talk about banning certain kinds of advertisements. Some people believe that some kinds of advertising should be banned. They feel that advertising can mislead people and that it encourages excessive consumerism and social inequality. They also feel that people can be very impressionable especially when they are young and so it is dangerous"
B2,"No Title Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place that often worked.

But for most of the student population, that wasn't an option. For them, there was just no such thing as a cheap flat, especially in areas of town near the universities and the city centre.

The second most popular way to find somewhere to live was by looking in the newspapers, and it was still an expensive business. Even with student rates, the cost of advertising was high and landlords were well aware that they would get the best pick of potential customers in that way.

The Dublin Post ran an advertisements section every Saturday, and every Tuesday, the Evening Press featured its weekly classifieds. Landlords who couldn't afford the price of advertising in the papers tended to pin up notices in cafes and bars around the city. But even these were quickly snapped up by eager students and, if the place wasn't too shabby, the price was still exorbitant.

Finding a room or flat to rent was a game, and it seemed as though you were always just on the edge of losing.

B2,"Interview Tips First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress our eye contact our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words. The most important of these factors, however, is how we make others feel about themselves. Make people feel at ease and good about themselves, and they will like you. The opposite is equally true. If we make them uncomfortable, or if we make them feel bad about themselves, they will not like us. The best way to make others feel good is to show a genuine interest in them. Learn the names of their children and the names of their company. If they say they just came from France or they just finished running a marathon, ask them about it. If someone wears a watch with a University logo, ask about their College experience. Ask others about what they do and how they got into it. Listen and respond to what they have to say. When you ask others about themselves, remember to focus on them, rather than on yourself. When someone asks you where you work or went to school, keep your answer short and polite. You want them to talk about themselves.

The 40% rule: Be on time.
It's crucial to be on time for your interview. According to management consultant John Bradley Jackson, being on time is the greatest sign of respect you can show your interviewer. Showing up 15 minutes early is preferable to arriving precisely on time. Being late for an interview is one of the biggest mistakes people can make and can easily lead to being immediately disqualified from the job. Arriving early allows you"
B2,"What had happened? Where had she gone? There was much confusion on the stage and in the audience. Raoul had cried out. Count Philippe had jumped up in his box. People looked at them and wondered if this event was connected in any way with the paragraph in the morning's paper.

It is possible, of course, to have an accident on the stage, even when one is not the main focus of the audience's attention. But when it happened at the Opera one cannot resist making certain assumptions.

A mysterious disappearance. A missing letter. A rumor in the morning paper about a scandal between an English gentleman and a married woman. The tension of anticipation was palpable.

It is a pity to have to disappoint the audience. They had so hoped to be treated to a grand display of excitement and drama. Instead, they were presented with a rather commonplace explanation of events, which we will detail below.

The singer, Miss Marguerite Gautier, had taken the opportunity of a change of scenery to pay a visit to her mother. She had informed her friends about her plans, but not the management. Her note was found in her dressing room, by an innocent bystander. It was not delivered to the office, as would have been correct, or, had it been, it would certainly have provoked inquiries about its author and destination. It was found in her dressing room after the rehearsal had begun. Her absence was discovered when the stage manager asked her to make an entrance and she did not appear.

B2,"Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. They have been part of human culture for thousands of years. From the ancient Greeks to the Pacific islanders, these graceful creatures are revered around the world. In ancient Greece, the dolphin was the divine messenger of Apollo, and its presence was considered a lucky omen. In the Pacific, dolphins are considered second only to the chief. But while they have their own day each year - September 13 is International Dolphin Day - things are not as rosy as they seem. Recent surveys indicate that many of our most iconic dolphins species are in deep trouble. The main threats are: Pollution: Dolphins are one of the top predators in the world's oceans and feed on many fish species that absorb pollutants from the environment. When the dolphins ingest these pollutants, the build-up can cause health problems. For example, the concentration of mercury in some dolphins is over 1,000 times higher than in their natural environment. Fishing gear: When dolphins swim through nets and fishing lines, they are at risk of becoming caught and injured, or worse. They can also be accidentally caught in fishing gear, an accidental victim known as ""by-catch"". Overfishing: When fish populations are depleted, dolphins have fewer prey to feed on. If their prey populations are affected, it can eventually affect"

The queen asked him if he had forgotten who he was speaking to. 'Oh!' replied Hamlet. 'I wish I could forget. Let not the royal bed of Denmark be a widow bed.' The queen, greatly offended at Hamlet's words, said that she would go to her chamber. Hamlet replied 'Go to your chamber, Lady. I am glad it is so.' He then drew his sword to kill the king. But Gertrude called out 'O Hamlet, stay! Remember thou art but a man, and thy mother too!' But he replied, 'A man to be way-laid in a corner with a few scilions!' But when she called 'O Hamlet, think of me!' he lowered his sword and she asked him to think of her in bed, but he answered 'I will do so, Lady. Go, go to your chamber!'

In the following scene, as Hamlet looked round for Laertes he noticed that Horatio was weeping. He asked Horatio the reason and Horatio answered 'The King's a corpse.' At which Hamlet broke into laughter and called upon the ghost to come and see him in Denmark.

A. ‘My customers are friends' says CHRISTINE HOGAN who runs a computer-aided design business with a turnover of over £200000 a year and four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved out of London to the country when our children were small and I wanted work I could do at home. After running a successful freelance business for five years I started the company. Now I design computer graphics for other businesses. As a home business, I’m not bound by normal office hours. My time is much more flexible than if I worked in the city. I love living in the countryside. It’s very tranquil and beautiful here, but it does have its problems. Transport and distribution for getting materials and products to my clients are two of the most difficult things I have to cope with. And I know that if I were in town I would probably find it easier to get more clients. But overall, I’m happy with the decision I made to move to the country.

I started the business after my husband died, and I just wanted to have more time with my children. My biggest problem was making the business profitable. It took about a year and a half to pay off the costs. But with a little help from the government, I managed it. I sell mainly to local people. Living in the country has lots of advantages like lower costs and a beautiful environment. But you need to have a thick skin because people can be very critical and not always kind. And it can be very lonely,"
B2,"Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves. In On the Origin of Species published in 1859 Darwin described the process of natural selection. The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. This process leads to the gradual development of new species. The theory of natural selection and evolution is still very important today.

The first part of this unit is an interactive timeline that introduces you to the main events in Darwin's life and the development of the theory of evolution.

The second part provides some definitions, examples and questions to test your understanding of the ideas presented.

The third part is a list of suggested reading and web resources to help you find out more.

### Interactive Timeline

1809 Charles Darwin born

Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, England, and grew up in a loving family. His father was a physician and a religious man. He was educated at home by tutors and attended medical lectures at Edinburgh University.

1826 Darwin starts at University College, London

At the University, Darwin studied medicine and natural science. However, his main interest was in natural history, which he pursued in his spare time.

1828 Darwin becomes acquainted with John Stevens Henslow, professor of botany

Henslow encouraged Darwin to use his scientific observations as the basis for his studies. Darwin began collecting information on the plants and animals that he encountered on long walks in the countryside.

1831 Voyage on HMS Beagle

In December, Darwin embarked on the five-year"
B2,"No Title We always went to Ireland in June. Ever since the four of us began to go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea not far from the village of Ardbeag. The lodge has been in the family since before my grandparents were married. We always stayed with Aunt May who looked after the place for us. She was a great cook and we would stay as long as we could get her to feed us. My two favourite parts of our trip were walking down to the shore at low tide and collecting mussels to eat. The other was swimming in the pool out front of Aunt May's house. We had a fantastic time and I hated to leave at the end of June. It was always hard to go back home. This year, however, it was a little harder. I got the news on our flight that my grandfather had died. My mum was crying the whole flight, and I just couldn't process what was happening. I wondered if I should cancel my trip. My mum said that she would cancel, but my grandmother wanted to go. My grandma is a strong person and I know that she needed to be with family. So we decided to go, but it was going to be a sad trip. I think everyone was waiting for the funeral announcement. I never really knew my grandpa. He lived in New York and we would never go to visit him. But I know he loved Ireland as much as we did. I decided that I would try and find out more about him. I spoke to some of my family members, and asked them questions about him. I learned that he was a very funny person who had"
B2,"Going up the wall  Once climbers went to the mountains. Now a challenging climb can be had anywhere indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. ""It is a mental battle,"" he says. ""You must be focused and determined. You have to overcome your fear."" ""I always want to do a little better. I don't want to just finish in the same position that I did last year."" Lombard finished third in his previous contest. He is hoping for a medal this time.

Practicing the skill  Indoor climbing is both popular and practical. ""One of the things that has happened in recent years,"" says Mark Simmonds of the British Mountaineering Council, ""is that more and more people are getting into climbing."" While the popularity of indoor climbing has soared, the number of traditional outdoor climbers has remained virtually constant. ""And you don't need a great deal of equipment to get started in indoor climbing,"" adds Simmonds. ""You don't need any experience either. All you need is a pair of climbing shoes and a safety harness."" And that is why many climbing organizations are encouraging indoor climbing. Many more people can be introduced to the sport under supervision. ""The supervision is also a way of keeping climbing out of the courts, "" says British Mountaineering Council chairman Bill Birkett. ""With the right training, indoor climbing can be extremely safe.""

B2,"However most of the problems were small and most of the guests at the conference were amazed by the network. After this the ARPAnet began to grow even more rapidly. But now it was not the world's only network of computers. After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful other networks began to appear. One of the first was CSNET. CSNET, which stands for Computing Services Network, was a creation of the Association for Computing Machinery. At first it was little more than a set of e-mail addresses and a few conference services. But the association intended to turn it into much more. Within five years CSNET was to connect 150 college computer sites. Also, in 1981, the U. S. Department of Defense set up a project with the goal of linking all of the computers in the defense community into a single network. They called the project MILNET. But there was another problem. At the time there were not enough ways to connect all the computers together. The computer was limited in the number of connections it could have. A solution was to build special devices that could link multiple computers at high speeds. These devices became known as routers. But routers cost a lot of money. And the government was not about to pay for them. To get a way around this the companies involved in the project built a network of companies to share the cost of the routers. In the same way that the ARPAnet had solved a problem which was blocking the way to better communications so, too, would this network solve a similar problem. Although it did not take long for the network to be working and working well. As the number of routers increased the speed of the network increased as well. As a result more and"

'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. Now aged nineteen Chris is still tall - 2.02 metres (6ft 7ins) - and now he’s finally joined the navy. 'I was actually worried about my size being a problem,' he said. 'But they’ve been very welcoming and they’ve fitted me out with an extra long harness for the ropes.' Chris is a boatswain’s mate and has already been working on the flagship of the Royal Navy, the frigate HMS Illustrious. 'I love it,' he said. 'It’s been a dream of mine since I was a boy. We had a photo day last week and I couldn’t help standing next to the captain to make the best of it. 'I’m too tall to fit into some of the spaces so that is a bit of a problem.' But it doesn’t seem to stop Chris enjoying his new life at sea. Chris lives in the Isle of Wight and is the tallest British sailor. His mother, Julie, said.

My son Gary was given his chance with cooking and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity I rushed over to look at the place. It was a derelict old pub in the middle of nowhere. The walls were stained with nicotine and tar. And to make matters worse the plumbing was almost non-existent. The bar was run down and out of date. There was only one tiny car park and there was no sign of life for miles. It was perfect. I was delighted to have found it. The only thing was, it needed a little work. It wasn't the sort of place I'd normally choose. But there was something about it I loved. Perhaps it was the challenge. You see, I was never one to back away from a challenge. But as I said, it needed work. And it took a lot of work. It was very tiring work and at times I wondered why the hell I had taken it on. But then again, that's what I get for my age. I thought to myself. The thing is, I could have given up. Many times, I considered giving up. But I wanted it to work. So, I pushed on. And, I guess that's what I'm good at. I like to push things as far as they can go. And if there was one thing I learned about my son Gary, it was that he didn't want to give up. And when I first met Gary, I couldn't help but notice how much we were alike. And the more I got to know him"

B2,"An eye for detail Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden.

Susan Shepherd was born in London in 1947 and has always had an affinity with flowers. After completing a three year foundation course at Chelsea School of Art, she spent a year at the Central School of Art and Design where she studied printing. On a trip to India, she discovered the art of miniature painting which greatly influenced her later work.

After returning from India, she painted a lot of detailed botanical images. During the 1970s and 80s, she became well-known for her detailed oil paintings of flowers. Her work is full of intricate details, giving the flowers a life-like quality. The influence of Indian painting is still visible in the way she paints her flowers. They are often set against a dark background, which makes the detailed blossoms shine like jewels.

In addition to painting, Susan Shepherd has also worked as a printmaker, producing etchings and monoprints. She has been a visiting lecturer at many universities and currently teaches painting at City and Guilds of London Art School.

Susan Shepherd’s work can be found in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and in private collections around the world. Her passion and respect for flowers comes through in her paintings, which capture the essence of the fragile beauty of the botanical world.

Explanation: The best answer is B. Matthew is very worried about Fiona. He doesn't want to talk about his problems with his best man. The two men are in very different places in their lives.

The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them. There was new furniture and Paul had a teacher. He was really going to Eton his father's school in the following autumn. Paul was over the moon at being accepted into the most prestigious school in the world. Paul's life now had a meaning. In this world and beyond, his uncle would be remembered as a good man for sending his godson to the most prestigious school in the world, Eton. His life was going to go on a new path. The next day Paul woke up early, full of energy and eagerness. He ran to his father's study and found his old suitcase. He put his old clothes inside. His suitcase was small, but it had a capacity of a thousand pieces of chocolate, that would be enough. Paul knew that whatever happened, he would always have what he loved. His old clothes were now like a talisman of his godfather. He took them from his suitcase and wore them. Paul left his house at last, in a very high spirit. He was really looking forward to getting to Eton in the fall.

This was the end of Uncle Oscar's journey but not the end of Paul's. The legacy of Uncle Oscar's sacrifice and generosity, will live on through the years, and beyond his grandchildren and great grandchildren. The love that Paul shared with his godfather, will forever be remembered. And for that we can be grateful.

Sarah studied catering at school and then went on to complete a level 2 NVQ in professional cookery. “I started working for the company three years ago, as a trainee. I now work as an assistant supervisor for Skiworld at the Alpine Hotel in Morzine, France. At any one time I’m looking after the needs of around 55 guests. ” My day starts around 8am.

When I met her she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. I can only imagine how many people do their shopping in awe of her. What's it like to captain the national team? It is the best feeling, there's no other word for it. We were at the Commonwealth Games and we beat Australia and I just remember walking off at the end, so excited. You can't beat it really. How's it been different from being a player? It's a privilege and a honour to lead them. I take my responsibilities very seriously - I don't take it lightly at all. I feel as though I need to bring that bit of extra leadership and experience. There are also more expectations on me, and there are days that are difficult. But the most rewarding part is seeing how much the players have progressed. I love being around a team of strong, passionate people. What's your biggest challenge? I think the pressure is the biggest challenge. You do want to do well and do well in front of people, but with netball you're just out there for 60 minutes. You can have such a good game one minute and then go on court the next and have the opposite. And, with the World Championships coming up next month you're never going to be 100% sure where you're going to be on the day. As for me, I'm excited.

B2,"ICE SKATING Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill. By the 15th century, skating had spread to Germany and was adopted by the nobility.

Skating in 19th century France was a way of keeping out of the fresh air and keeping out of trouble. This form of entertainment was considered a proper pastime for young women and it helped them avoid the perils of young men, gambling and loose morals. In the Victorian era, outdoor skating became popular and people would travel on the train from London to Brighton to go ice skating on the frozen ponds.

The first recorded use of steel blades dates back to the 15th Century. Iron skates were being manufactured in Switzerland and Germany by the 16th century. The first recorded ice hockey game was played on January 31, 1853. Skate design has changed little over the years. The key technological developments include the addition of wheels, the introduction of steel blades, and the addition of wheels to the bottom of the skates. In the 1940s the first skate parks were built, where people could use their roller skates in place of ice skates.

In the 1930s, steel blades were welded to the bottom of roller skates. These were called roller blades. These were soon followed by plastic wheels. By the 1950s roller skates and ice sk"

Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions) distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage).

This was the classified advert run by me last week. I am still waiting for the replies.

There has been an upsurge in interest in triathlons with an emphasis on endurance sport but also for the social side of being part of something like a triathlon club.

I have been doing triathlons since I was 13. At 17 now I have been selected to represent the GB age group team for the ITU world championships in Beijing.

Some may think I am too young to make a good performance at senior level, but I have been racing internationally since 2002. I feel I have the ability to make my own way and do well.

While I believe in the importance of hard work in achieving your goals, I also believe that there are times when I need a helping hand.

I need someone that has the same attitude to sport as myself.

B2,"We are literally drowning in news. Have you ever tried reading the whole newspaper including the financial and sports pages? Or have you followed every piece of news on the front page of a news website? It's practically impossible. Reuters alone puts out 3.5 million news stories a year. And that's just one source.

So how do you decide which news is important and which isn't? You need to establish criteria for determining what is worth your time and what isn't.

First of all, consider your interests. You might be very interested in news about your own country, but might not care at all about news from another continent. Similarly, you might be passionate about sports, but don't really care about the latest movie releases.

Secondly, how recent is the news? News loses relevance very quickly. Today's big headline is usually yesterday's forgotten story. Therefore, pay attention to older news that is still relevant and important to you.

Thirdly, consider the source of the news. How reliable is it? Does it come from a reputable news outlet, such as the BBC or Al Jazeera, or is it a clickbait website that just wants to generate advertising revenue with sensational headlines? It's not only about the content, but also about the intention of the news source.

Finally, you should also consider the impact of the news. What are the consequences of this event, and what does it mean for your life? Does it affect your own community or your personal circumstances? Can you learn from it? Does it inspire or inform you in some way?

So, how do you keep up with the news without getting overwhelmed? Simply by filtering out what is"
B2,"Trying to get published? If you are wondering where to send your story our expert Margaret Stubbs is here with the advice you need. Readers of this magazine often write in saying 'I have written this story / book. What do I do now?'

'What do you do with a manuscript once you have finished it?'

Well, you have quite a few options.

1. Try to get published.

This can be done in several ways. You can send it to a publisher and ask them if they would like to publish it. But, because publishers get many submissions, it can be very hard to get published this way, especially for a new writer.

You can also send it to an agent. An agent is someone who finds authors and books for publishers. If they like your book, they will take it on. They will try to get a publisher interested and then will look after the business side of your contract. But again, this is a very competitive area and not easy to get into, especially for a new writer.

2. Self-publish.

This means that you will pay to have your book printed and then do all the selling and promoting yourself. This is not as difficult as it sounds, but it will cost money and take a lot of your time and energy.

3. Start your own publishing company.

This is not as difficult as it sounds either. There are lots of people out there who can help you. But, again, it will cost money and will take a lot of your time and energy.

B2,"In the weeks before the end of the tax year everyone in the firm was especially busy. With no wife to go home to Mitch worked later than anyone else. Besides he had extra work to do. One night at three in the morning he unlocked Avery's office on the fourth floor with one of the keys Abby had given him.

Mitch made his way down the hall, past the supply closet where there was a light burning, but nobody else around. On the fifth floor the lights in the break room were on and Mitch saw someone in there. He knocked softly on the door and went in.

""Hey. It's me. Sorry to disturb you.""

It was Lisa. She jumped up from her chair.

""Hey, it's you. Jeez, what are you doing up here at this hour? I thought I was the only one.""

""Yeah. Working late.""

""Why?""

""I'm not sure I know how to answer that.""

""What?""

""Well, I mean, I've got extra work to do.""

""That's what they all say, Mitchell."" Lisa gave him a little smile. ""Is everything alright?""

""Yeah, it's fine. I mean, it's a lot of work but you know..."" He hesitated. ""What do you do for fun?""

B2,"Film Critic Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing - novels for other newspapers films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. It was my dream job. Being able to watch films for free and write about them for a newspaper meant I got to work at home and I did so for ten years.

As a film critic it was easy for me to become complacent in my role. The thing that made me want to write about films in the first place is that I wanted to share my love of cinema with others. I was passionate about films and I wanted to make people passionate about them too. But during my tenure at The Front Page, the passion slowly faded. I lost interest in cinema as a whole and the films that I reviewed were the same films that had been there for years - blockbusters, rom-coms, superhero films and the usual suspects.

When I started writing for the newspaper, my focus was on the best films - the films that would inspire people to make more of their life - and that made my work important. But over the years, my priorities changed. I started to write about films that I wanted to write about, not about the ones that would make a difference to people. I lost sight of what made me passionate about film in the first place.

At one point, I even considered quitting my job and getting a 'real job'. The work that I was doing was not fulfilling and I felt as if I was stagnating. This wasn't a career - it was just a job, and one that I"
B2,"Favourite places Bruce I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me not empty deserts. When I was eight I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. I remember well the church in the old village, the ruins of its 7th-century monastery and the picturesque houses. Then on Sundays, instead of going to the village church, I would wander alone in the forest, enjoying the silence and peacefulness. When I came home again, I always wished I could be back in England. Today I don't travel much, but I can close my eyes and go straight back to Lastingham. I like other beautiful places, but I think this particular place will always be in my heart.

My favourite place is the quiet village where I went to school. As a boy of eight I would cycle to the beautiful village of Lastingham on Saturdays and I never tired of wandering through its lovely valley.

The church and the old ruins of its 7th-century monastery have made a deep impression on me, but above all, I loved the picture-esque houses and the serenity of the place. Whenever I was there, I wished I could stay forever.

Sundays were particularly beautiful. Then, instead of going to the church, I would wander alone in the nearby forest, listening to the birds and enjoying the stillness. I still remember those moments of peace and joy very clearly.

Today I travel little, but Lastingham is always in my mind. Whenever I go there in my mind's"
B2,"'Archie' said Mrs Easterbrook to her husband 'listen to this.' Colonel Easterbrook paid no attention. He was busy reading The Times. 'These reporters know nothing about India' he said. 'Nothing! If they did they wouldn't write such rubbish.' 'Yes I know' said his wife. 'Archie do listen. A murder is announced and will take place on Friday October 29th at Little Paddocks at 6.30 p.m. and we are to be there too.' 'Well if we must' muttered the Colonel, putting down his newspaper.

A murder is announced, a light and entertaining drawing room mystery in which everyone at Little Paddocks is invited to the party where a murder is planned to take place.

The only problem is that no one knows who is going to be murdered and who is going to do the murdering. What with a mysterious Mr. Hartridge, a suspicious Miss Gilchrist, an eccentric Merrion who claims to be the brother of the victim, and a whole host of characters to choose from, it is no surprise that when the murder finally takes place, it does not go exactly as planned. In fact, it is a complete surprise.

Mrs Easterbrook and her husband, Colonel Easterbrook, make up one of the guests. As we are introduced to each character, we get to know them a bit, understand their personalities, and make a few wild guesses. I found this a delightful book and thoroughly enjoyed the playful manner in which the author has written it.

Mystery is not a genre that I usually go for, but I find this book delightful with a lot of wit, humor, and eccentric characters. I enjoyed the surprise ending very much, and the way it was crafted. It is one of those books which is very light and perfect for a quiet afternoon,"
B2,"Careers Advice You're not happy in your job at the moment but you don't know how to change? Kitty Doherty gives some good advice. The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser. You will be asked to write a brief history of yourself and then sit through a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. These will assess your skills, strengths and weaknesses. This information will then be used to construct a personal career plan. Kitty Doherty looks at the benefits.

## Careers advice

Careers advice has been around for a long time. Before the establishment of the careers guidance profession in the 1970s it was only available from schools, employers or further education colleges.

Careers advisers are often called counsellors or consultants and they are trained in careers guidance. This is a professional development qualification recognized across the globe.

Careers advisers are trained to understand the complexity of the career decision making process. They are knowledgeable in the use of psychometric tests and they must be able to interpret the results and provide appropriate advice.

Career guidance is available from a number of sources:

- state-funded careers guidance in schools
- charities and charitable organizations
- professional career guidance firms (you can find them listed in directories such as the one available from the British Association of Vocational Test Users (BAVT))
- voluntary organizations such as the Prince's Trust
- employment agencies
- Job Centres Plus and local authorities
- the National Careers Service

There is also a range of information available via the internet and in book form including career assessment inventories and other assessment tools which you can complete yourself.

B2,"IN HOT WATER Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. Professor Mills travels in a special submarine called an Alvin and also uses a remote operated vehicle (ROV) called Jason Junior to collect samples of rocks and mud in deep trenches, a few miles below the sea. She investigates how heat is stored and transferred within and beneath the ocean. Understanding this is important because it helps scientists work out how the climate has changed over millions of years. They want to know how the earth is heating up and whether humans are affecting climate change or if it is due to natural processes within the planet. The research takes Rachel around the world and means she is away from home for long periods of time. While she is away, Rachel sends emails and phone messages to her husband and their three children so they know she is OK. Rachel’s family has now moved to Florida in America and she misses them very much but knows that she must continue with her work.

B2,"Kowloon Walled City had no wall around it. Standing apart from the neighbouring buildings it rose to fourteen floors-buildings with more buildings piled on top. Legally it belonged to the People's Republic of China a part of the colony that was never British. In fact neither Chinese nor British law had effect there. Law ruled the Walled City in the guise of gangsters, drug pushers, and illegal distillers of white spirit.

Yet the Chinese government could not do what it liked. In a place without legal status, the government had to work with what it had, and what it had was two things. Firstly, it had its connections, the power derived from its influence over the society at large. Secondly, the government had its special relationship with the criminal gangs.

This special relationship had developed in the 1950s when the government had allowed gangs to operate freely in the Walled City. These gangs had a monopoly on services like rubbish disposal, electricity, and water supply. They also controlled the rental market, but they did not run the police.

The government's strategy for the Walled City was to use it as a lever in dealings with the criminal gangs. The gangs' ability to operate in the city was dependent on their co-operation with the government. The police and the gangs were not necessarily the same things.

Throughout the history of modern China, the police had struggled with the gangs. In the Walled City, the police worked for the government, while the gangs controlled the city.

On one hand the government wanted the gangs to co-operate with it and carry out its directives. On the"
B2,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE When you first enter the Model Village it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground flat and completely overgrown with brambles. For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land. To all practical purposes it was so, having only a few bramble bushes and a couple of old apple trees on it.

Situated as it was, at the corner of the village, it was a good site for a village of some sort. So the idea was conceived to build a model village there, in which the houses and buildings could be built in the traditional style of the district.

The area was cleared of brambles and overgrown vegetation and the building of the village began. Every building, from the model farm, to the windmill, is a scale model and was built and finished as far as possible in the traditional manner.

As the project developed the architect and builder who was in charge of the construction, realised that their aim was not just to build a model village, but also to try to recreate a small farming community of the past. As they worked they also tried to restore to it some of the skills, customs and traditions which have become almost lost in the rush of progress.

This has now been achieved and visitors will find that they can not only enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the area, but also get a glimpse of the past. The village is a unique place where you can see all the different skills needed to make a community. There are blacksmith, wheelwright, cooper, potter, and many more as well as the model farm and windmill.

B2,"Variations on a Theme If you're thinking of taking children to a theme park there are dozens to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to test the best. Fun Island - The Burns family Last year we went to a huge theme park in the US and we thought that Fun Island might seem dull by comparison. But what a surprise! I can't compare it with Disneyland - they're very different experiences. Fun Island is just as exciting! The kids loved the huge water slides and splashing pools. The only thing we couldn't agree on was which of the rides was the best.

Aquapark - The Thomas family This was our first time at Aquapark and we were amazed at the range of rides. The main water rides had very high minimum height restrictions but the kids still had a fantastic day. Aquapark is not as big as Fun Island but it's not as crowded, which made it more relaxing. Our kids had a great time splashing around in the shallow pools.

Ocean City - The Walker family
We went to Ocean City with our friends and our children. This park was enormous and quite overwhelming. There were so many slides and pools to choose from, it was difficult to decide where to start. Once we'd all chosen a ride, the kids loved the rides, especially the indoor wave pool. We did have to wait in line for quite a while, though.

Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it. A Jenny When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I'd always be looking down, not really talking to anyone and my confidence was low.

Jody Ann But then, I got a job in a restaurant, and my confidence grew because I was working with people. Just by doing that every day, I realised I was able to talk to people without being nervous.

Nina So, just by working in this job, you were able to build up your confidence?
Jody Ann Exactly, I was able to build up my confidence by talking to different people on a daily basis and working as part of a team, knowing that I had to communicate with them.
Jody Ann And also I was dealing with customers, which is another part of being confident. So, I'd say if I can do it, anyone can.

My line of work Four people talk about their jobs. Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser Science Museum

I'm responsible for putting temporary exhibitions together. This includes planning and designing the exhibition and promoting it. When we've decided what exhibits to have, I need to contact a lot of people to make them happen. For example, artists, curators, conservators, engineers, and other museum departments. I have to create an amazing visitor experience that is accessible to everyone.

I don't have a typical day because every exhibition is different and has its own unique challenges. But I start by checking my emails and going through my to-do list. Then I have meetings with various people to discuss the exhibition.

I like the fact that no two exhibitions are the same, and I'm always learning something new. I also find it very rewarding to hear that our exhibitions have really made a difference to the way people think or feel about science.

My job was influenced by the temporary exhibition I worked at in the last museum I worked at. I really enjoyed the buzz of organizing such a big and challenging project, and I wanted to do more.

B2,"The kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and riversfeeding on fish. Old trees overhang the stream half shading shallow water. Soft greens mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze.

Charlie says The bird is small but has a big character. The bird has a very hard beak, used for breaking the shells and bones of the fish it feeds on. This beak is so sharp that it can also cut through plastic fishing line left in the water. It can dive like an arrow into deep water, holding its breath for several seconds.

This bird has an interesting social life too. Male and female kingfishers nest very close to each other. The male has a special piece of fish to feed his female partner when she chooses him to be her mate. After that they remain mates for life, though they have different home bases.

The kingfisher also has special dives in air as it lands. Before it touches the water or the tree it flutters its wings for some time. It is one of the most beautiful birds in the world. When it returns to its home after a dive it makes a distinctive call.

Charlie says that the kingfisher is not just a beautiful bird but also plays a major role in the ecosystem. Because kingfishers eat so many fish, they help keep populations in balance. In many rivers, the decline of this bird shows that the river is polluted. Where there is a healthy population, we know that the water is relatively clean.

Charlie advises those who wish to photograph the kingfisher to stay very still"
B2,"Studio Audiences What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical difficultiesstudio audiences are just another common feature of television lifeand yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows for example we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? More than 12,000 of them have already had their day in the limelight and have been to their local studio.

For a long time we have all had the idea that if we were in the audience of a television programme we could be in for a treat.

For example, when The National Lottery was first broadcast we saw what the studio was supposed to be like - a packed auditorium with the audience going wild at the prospect of winning a large jackpot - and we all imagined that it must be a great thrill to be in a crowd of people all screaming and shouting together.

So when I was offered a chance to be a member of the audience for a television show, I jumped at it.

Apart from the obvious excitement, being in a studio audience also has an advantage that is very rarely publicised - a free night out. And not only are you going out somewhere for free, you're also being paid to do so. At least, that was the case when I attended.

So what is it like to be in a studio audience? If you think that you know the show already, you are in for a big shock. The reality is far from the way it is portrayed on TV.

The most obvious difference is the lack of an audience. In most shows, you're lucky if there are more than 50 people in a studio that is supposed to"
B2,"It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. And yet there he stands, fourteen years on, looking out at the sunlit sea and feeling about six foot tall. For Chris Greener is now the UK’s tallest man and he’s no longer in the navy; these days he's the proud owner of a 37 foot yacht. His story is inspiring. It’s inspirational. It’s motivating. And it’s all because of Chris’s mindset.

A mindset that said: ‘Being tall is cool.’ Chris grew up in a family where his father was ‘only’ 6ft 3”. To Chris that seemed short. He wanted to be different and to be different he set his eyes on a big target. For Chris, setting the bar high was not just desirable, it was essential. And that mindset helped Chris reach the dizzying heights of six feet eleven and a half inches - the tallest a man can be in the navy, so Chris couldn’t join. Instead he went into the RAF and served his country. And it wasn’t easy. In the navy, it’s tough to look up to someone who is as tall as the masts of the ships you serve on. In the RAF, Chris often had to duck to get through doorways - and that was hard too. But each time Chris hit the highs - he just knew he would get past the lows. Each"
B2,"In April 1919 the British rulers in India decided to put down protests in the city of Amritsar. As people gathered in the public garden during the festival of Vaisakhi a British general ordered his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd. As well as thousands of injuries there were hundreds of deaths. The general was disciplined for his misjudgement but he continued to serve in the army, whilst many Indians were furious. The anger caused by this event contributed to growing support for Indian independence from Britain.

1. Why did the British want to put down protests in the city of Amritsar?
2. How did the general show his disregard for human life?
3. What happened after the British general had been disciplined?

The answers can be found in the passage.

1. The British wanted to put down protests in the city of Amritsar to maintain control and keep the people from becoming too radical.
2. The general showed his disregard for human life by ordering his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd, resulting in hundreds of deaths.
3. The general was disciplined for his actions, but he continued to serve in the army. This only added to the anger of many Indians who were seeking independence from Britain.

B2,"GM's clever EN-V concept is a two-wheeled two-seater solution to urban transport. Telegraph Motoring's Mike Rutherford has a preview and takes it for a spin. That's because of the nature of the EN-V. Last week I drove one of these though it was more like flying a small plane than driving.

The EN-V, or Electric Networked-Vehicle, is an electric, two-passenger single track vehicle. Rather than drive it, you 'fly' the vehicle around in an odd sort of 3-D world. The steering wheel twists around so it points forwards as you drive and turns into a joy stick for flying.

This is what you do; look up, down, left, right and all around, and if you are over a pedestrian, you will see a dot as if with a gun sight, where the EN-V is going. Once you've lined up your target, push the stick down and the EN-V will take you there. Once you've landed, it will spin to face the correct direction. It is a curious sensation and you do feel like you are flying, especially as the scenery whizzes by.

The actual drive part is a bit more pedestrian (sorry) as you control it with two joysticks on the control panel in front of you. You steer with one, and control your speed with the other.

It can do 45mph and with an electric power unit, has a range of 60 miles on a single charge. A neat piece of technology, especially in a dense urban area where it can travel in lanes too narrow for a car.

B2,"What would happen to our planet if humans were to suddenly disappear? This is the basic hypothesis behind Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us. Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear. In one chapter there is an analysis of how New York would survive if there were no humans to take care of it.

According to the calculations, it would take about 500 years for nature to reclaim Manhattan. However, it is important to note that it would take 1,000 years to fully restore its original ecosystems. In the meantime, the absence of humans would mean a return of wolves to the area, along with the rapid growth of vegetation.

Weisman explains that with the absence of human activity, New York would eventually be almost entirely swallowed up by nature. In fact, only the core of the island of Manhattan would remain visible above the ground due to the rocky layers underneath. Some of the rock would be exposed to the elements, and eventually erode and disappear.

Apart from the growth of vegetation, the disintegration of New York's buildings would also occur. The author points out that it would take the Statue of Liberty about 300 years to collapse. This could block the East River and cause flooding.

Birds, including the hawks that were once nearly extinct, would return to New York and would be able to nest and reproduce in the buildings. The absence of humans would also enable the city's rivers, such as the Gowanus Canal, to gradually rejuvenate themselves and become inhabitable for fish and other marine life.

Rodents, including rats and mice, would proliferate without human interference"
B2,"Living in the valley We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival. It was the year when the storms came early before the calendar even hinted at winter even before November was out.

The weather warnings on the radio kept mentioning the same old phrase, ‘Storm Brian’. The name had a sort of ring to it, almost as if it was a person rather than a storm. We could not believe that there would actually be storms that were so bad they would actually name them.

A couple of days after the first warnings had come over the radio, there it was. The storm did not disappoint. It was as bad as they said it would be. With the wind strong enough to knock down trees in seconds, it was a very dangerous situation.

Our valley was surrounded by hills on all sides, some as high as a thousand feet. With storms this powerful, there would be a high chance of avalanches occurring in the hills above us. If one did, we would not stand a chance.

With the radio warning system now being used, we were well prepared. Our house had been built with two massive air raid shelters designed to withstand the full force of a storm, or avalanche. Our water supply came from a nearby spring that flowed all year round. Our farmland was used for growing food and keeping livestock.

We thought we had prepared everything necessary but even the most prepared will have those moments when fear and panic starts to set in. With the storm raging outside, the fear was becoming intense. All we could do at that stage was just to hope for the"

She was dressed in overalls and ugly big shoes and a bush of wiry hair framed her pretty face. She looked very shabby, her boots were worn through in spots and she had on one black glove.

And so Rita came to his shop once a week, and each time she paid him one dollar. After a year the little girl married a young mechanic, and when the war broke out and all the men went to fight, she was left alone.

One day she returned to Seymour's shop to find out if he could get her husband work. Seymour and the men working there were surprised to see her and to hear that her husband was a mechanic.

She went away and came back with her husband, who had not noticed the men on the wall and roof, for he was blind"
B2,"Style Merchants Style informs every part of our lives today from clothes to interior decoration and accessories. Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion. Ned Ingham: Dress Designer Ned Ingham makes dreamy romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles' he explains. Jo Foley: Jewellery Designer If you are looking for a personal statement, this is the place to find it. 'Bold jewellery is in fashion, from the bright colours of coral and turquoise to the unusual texture of glass and the sophisticated elegance of silver,' Jo Foley explains. Dressing Up: Tuxedos for Women, Men and Dogs If you thought the black-tie look was for men only, you'd be wrong. With a new twist on the concept of the dinner suit, the female of the species is now embracing it. But a twist does not mean abandoning the tuxedo, rather it is just a way of putting your own mark on it. Fashion is a world that is continuously changing and developing, and the tuxedo is one of the items of clothing that has evolved with time. The men's tuxedo is a wardrobe staple, but this is also increasingly the case for women. The women's tuxedo, also known as the white-tie gown, is a sleek and elegant dress that takes inspiration from the classic male tuxedo and has developed over time. The men's tuxedo dates back to the mid-19th century and has had many styles, such as the double-breasted jacket, a single-breasted jacket, a shawl collar, and a peak lapel"
B2,"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour.

By this time, the musical ability in question may have been identified by others, perhaps even by the child, but not by you. 

The idea of sending your child to a specialist music school may first occur to you when you notice that:
- Your child often seems bored or dissatisfied with ordinary school lessons.
- Your child spends a lot of time alone or isolated from others.
- Your child seeks solace in music, using it as a kind of self-therapy.
- Your child is extremely sensitive to sounds and noises, either positive or negative.
- Your child has trouble accepting criticism or advice from people in general.

A specialist music school can offer your child a much-needed opportunity to focus on their gift and to achieve success.

There are many such schools throughout Britain. Many state schools and all independent schools in England now offer music as a specialist option on the national curriculum. Music is a 'curriculum specialist' subject, along with modern languages, technology and science.

These schools are often geared towards encouraging and nurturing musical talent. Pupils can receive excellent tuition in their main instrument as well as ensemble experience with orchestras, choirs and bands. Most also offer tuition in other instruments, music theory, aural training and composition.

Apart from the musical aspect of the curriculum, these schools also emphasize the importance of balance. The"
B2,"A NEW LIFE The Farmer Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm. 'After 14 years in business I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. It was a long and sad decline into mediocrity,' he says. A TASTE OF LIFE Mr Froggatt, 45, left his job and moved into a farm in Buckinghamshire, just outside London. In January he was sent to Wiltshire in the west of England on a job related to his career, and then on a Sunday he went to see the area. 'I had lunch in a typical village pub. The first thing I noticed was the friendliness of the people, how open and relaxed everyone was. It was incredibly pleasant,' he says. He also liked the rolling countryside, with its chalk cliffs and downs - a contrast to the flatness of his Buckinghamshire home. He returned home but soon afterwards he 'found the city life stifling and depressing', and decided to sell up. 'It was a difficult decision because everything had been going well for me, but the pull of this way of life was too great,' he he says. Earlier this month, he sold his house and car and bought a farm in Wiltshire with his brother, called The Farm At The Edge Of The World. The land had previously been used for sheep farming but hadn't been worked for three years. His plans to redevelop it were rejected, but he's not worried. 'My brother and I will get in there and start clearing the weeds and brambles. It should be a"
B2,"Drop me a line! In our fast world of phones fax machines and computers the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing altogether. Yet to me there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival the pleasure of seeing who it is from and finally the enjoyment of the contents. Please don't deprive yourself or me of this pleasure. The best address to write to me is the one on the back of this postcard. My secretary reads every letter that arrives at this office but it is very difficult for her to understand what I say. It is my duty to reply as often as possible - you can imagine how difficult this can be!

So please when you write to me
1. use a pencil or a pen
2. write large enough that I can read what you have to say
3. please don't use red ink I am unable to read it.
4. if you must cross something out do so with a black pencil or with an ordinary pencil and write over it to obliterate it
5. if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. It is after all my duty to help you as much as I can
6. lastly please keep all letters short. It is much easier for me to see a lot of short letters than a few long ones.

There have been many times when I have received letters from you that are either too long or written too small that it is impossible for me to see the contents or read it at all. I must explain that the size of type is no help when the writing is too small and so if in the future you will do this I shall be very much obliged. I have read some very lovely letters from children"

The four people came from different walks of life;

- Kati, a teacher;
- Krista, a dentist;
- Henri, a chef;
- Maija, a student.

We sent them to try a completely different profession for a day. Here’s how they all got on:

- Teacher Kati was transformed into a dentist, where she learned to fill a cavity. “When the drilling began, I found out it was louder than I expected! However, it was a great feeling to help improve someone’s health.”
- Dentist Krista got to learn from the best at a high-end restaurant. She had a chance to prepare tasty salmon in dill sauce and to get instructions on how to create a stunning presentation. ""I was surprised by how calmly the chefs worked under pressure. I loved the way they created something beautiful from raw ingredients.”
- Chef Henri decided to try out teaching and helped a class of high-school students understand the importance of history. “It was a new challenge to try to make a topic like world history as interesting and entertaining as possible. It was fun to use my imagination to explain difficult subjects and I even discovered that I have a natural talent for it!”
- Student Maija had the chance to become a dental nurse for the day and help set up equipment, take patients’ details, and even serve tea"
C1,"Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country says Georgina Ferry but she is little known For the past four years I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. The vast majority of them have never heard of her. I am amazed by this. When she died at the age of 91 in 1994, she was the only female Briton to have received a Nobel prize for science. And yet the general public seem to have not just forgotten her, but never to have known of her existence. Dorothy Hodgkin with one of her prizes. She won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 and is considered one of the 20th-century’s most significant scientists. It's not that she was unknown outside Britain. Her work as a protein crystallographer was internationally recognised. Hodgkin, who had been a student at Somerville College Oxford (an institution which she helped save from destruction in World War II) was one of the scientists involved in the discovery of the structure of penicillin and she shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964. The following year she shared another with her colleague Sir John Desmond Bernal, for her work on the structure and geometrical packing of proteins and nucleic acids. She was also awarded the Order of Merit, the highest honour that can be given to a British citizen. But she is not in the public consciousness, and this can be put down in large measure to the fact that her work was done in the shadows of men; in"
C1,"Under Sarah's Spell Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. Here she is interviewed by Joanna Watt There cannot he many artists who l10 not sign their work unless they are asked to. Sarah Janson a trompe-l'oeil artist is one. Why is that? Janson explains, I don't sign my work because it is a way of keeping the viewer in the story, it is like an actor playing a role. I also prefer to keep myself out of the narrative.'

Watt: What gave you the idea of trompe-l'oeil art?

Janson: When I studied architecture and interior design, I became aware of the concept of trompe-l'oeil, which is a way of making an illusion to represent a reality. I have always been interested in storytelling and illusion. When I began painting, it became clear to me that the two went together naturally. The idea of making an illusion where none exists, in a painting, is what makes it interesting, challenging and exciting. I wanted to do that with my work.

Watt: What kind of stories do you tell?

Janson: I think my stories are about people going about their daily routine, whether it's work or leisure activities. They tend to focus on the private lives of individuals. They are everyday stories with a dreamy atmosphere.

Watt: What would you like people to feel when they are looking at your work?

Janson: Firstly, I would like them to be drawn into the painting and, secondly, I'd like to evoke an atmosphere of tranquillity and serenity, even though"

C1,"A trumpet isn’t just for Christmas… It is strange how many musicians even leading ones come from homes without music. Out of the blue Hakan Hardenberger the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world’s trumpet-players today. “My life has been one long adventure” he says. “I love the trumpet because it has such a strong voice”… (quoted from the record sleeve).

I first encountered Hardenberger in a radio programme broadcast in the year of the millennium (2000) on BBC Radio 3 I think. I remember being absolutely thrilled and captivated by the richness and tone of his playing and from that time on he has been one of my favourite classical musicians. Over the years I have acquired several of his recordings and enjoyed them immensely.

This particular recording features two quite different works. The first is called The Trumpet Concerto in E-flat Major Op. 38 and was composed by Carl Maria von Weber in 1812. It is one of only three solo concertos that he wrote, the other two featuring the flute and clarinet, and whilst these are often played more frequently than the trumpet concerto, it is nonetheless a splendid and entertaining piece. 

The second work is called Brass Concertos which was composed by Steven Stucky in 2005 and comprises three separate movements each featuring a different brass instrument. This piece is much more modern in sound, and was written for the Boston Symphony Orchestra and its three then principal brass soloists including Hardenberger himself.

A. HENLOW GRANGE I welcomed the opportunity to go to Henlow Grange for six days as I was tired and needed to relax. The place is beautifully situated in a wooded glade on the edge of Henlow, Bedfordshire. On arrival, we were shown to our rooms, each of which had a large spacious feel and was extremely comfortable. We were given a choice of several types of treatment - mud packs, hot stone massages, full body and face massages, and even facials. I went for the mud pack first, followed by the hot stone massage and ended up with a facial. The results were fantastic. My skin looked ten years younger and my shoulders were free from the strains of life's stresses. My room overlooked a beautiful lake and I spent much of my time reading books by the lakeside, which was very peaceful. The staff is extremely friendly and you can't help but feel welcome.

Emma was very kind to think of Charles, and to imagine she had been thinking of him while reading the letter that he was now reading. He felt a momentary shiver of tenderness for her, which might have been the beginning of a change in him.

Rouen was only a little way away. He got into the carriage in a couple of minutes, and they started. The roads were good, and he had plenty of time, and it would be well to spend it pleasantly.

A book lay on the seat beside him. He opened it and commenced to read. Emma's letter was folded in his breast-pocket. He would not look at it again, but he wanted to feel it there, against his heart.

This was to be his last journey in a carriage; henceforward he would walk.

C1,"Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work. A. What makes a good leader? A leader is one who inspires an agent of change a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better as the early theorists believed. Leadership is based on competencies and skills which are teachable, not a matter of genetics. Competence in a leader includes the ability to motivate and persuade, decision making and strategic vision. A good leader makes you feel good - creates a positive atmosphere. A leader is also a listener - open minded and willing to consider the advice of others. Competence involves the ability to recognize opportunities and a keen sense of timing. Effective communication, adaptability and resilience, humility, self-confidence and a strong value system are among other key competences. B. What leadership styles suit you? Different people have different leadership style. A style that suits one person may not suit another person. The style of a leader needs to be in sync with the followers. Successful leaders can adapt their style to the situation. To find your leadership style, it is essential to be self aware - reflect on your strengths, weaknesses, needs and values. You may be authoritarian or democratic or laissez-faire or pacesetting - the style can be a combination of the mentioned styles or another one. The four styles mentioned above are: 1. Authoritarian - Leader makes decisions on behalf of the followers. May not be effective with self-motivated employees. 2. Democratic - The leader involves followers in decision making. It is usually effective with motivated employees. 3. Laissez-faire - The leader allows"
C1,"Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession A The rules for work are changing We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are or by our training and expertise but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. We are being asked to exercise not only 'book smarts' - our intellectual or technical skills - but also 'emotional intelligence': the capacity to understand, use and control our own emotions in a way that relates to our interactions with others. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 'Daniel Goleman, the eminent psychologist who first coined the term 'Emotional Intelligence', argues that a person's emotional intelligence is far more important to success than their intellectual and technical abilities. He identifies five key components of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills. It is these five components that help define how we deal with the complexities of everyday life, the ups and downs that come with every job and the unexpected twists and turns of a career. Daniel Goleman's important book helps us to identify the key qualities that differentiate outstanding employees from mediocre ones, and to better understand and control our own emotions, the emotions of other people and the emotional demands of the world around us. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills are the five areas that define emotional intelligence, explains Goleman. These five areas can significantly affect the course of your career and the choices you make within your working environment, he asserts, adding that the development of your emotional intelligence is not only important in order"

C1,"Sound the Alarm Stuart Harris reports Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? In a recent article on the CNET website, Mike Gikas has some helpful tips: - Look for a digital alarm; an electromechanical alarm will give you a headache. - Don't buy a radio that uses a standard battery: you'll have to replace the battery yourself. An AA or AAA cell is a good choice - they are inexpensive and last a long time. - If you want a CD player or a tape player, buy a single-model stereo radio. - Look for a built-in rechargeable battery. This way you won't need to replace the batteries, and the radio will continue to work during a power outage. - Finally, remember to check the frequency range. For those who live near busy streets, the FM band has more static, but you can find fewer stationary signals in the AM band. Choose the one that best suits your needs. What to avoid: - Avoid radios with a built-in AM-FM receiver. The signals can interfere with one another, making a noisy sound. - Don't buy a clock that requires constant adjustment. Digital clocks should allow for automatic updates. - Look for a unit with an alarm volume control. This will allow you to set the radio at a comfortable volume level while still waking you up in the morning.

C1,"With the trees I planted my stake in New Zealand JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER Jonallum Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology'. I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn’t have any summers. 1980 was the first year I was away from home at university and since then until 1985 I was either in the Arctic, Antarctica or somewhere in the southern hemisphere during our summers, and in the other hemisphere in the northern summer.

I’ve had no winter holidays whatsoever and I’ve missed every British summer since 1980 apart from about 10 days in 1985 when I was doing some work on the Barbican Centre in London. During the last five or six months, I’ve been back in the UK more often than before because it’s a year since the new WWF [World Wide Fund for Nature] office opened and we are busy trying to move the organisation to the next stage in its evolution.

That’s taken up the best part of a year since it officially opened in September.

What I’ve found most exciting is how much we have been able to achieve so far within this new structure. I find working for a larger organisation more stimulating than running a relatively small one. There are more opportunities to get things done and you can be involved in many more diverse areas of concern.

If you look at the way the WWF is now organised, it is much more flexible and it takes a more holistic view of the environment, including the social and economic consequences of environmental activities.

C1,"Hide and Seek Yvonne Coppard Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game — surveillance of a suspicious bookshop — when she realises that one of its rare customers is her Uncle Jim. He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard. Told with restrained sensitivity and sharp observation. An unusually good juvenile novel.

I would like to read this novel as it has been highly recommended to me by a librarian at my school. I think it would be interesting to read a book about spying and crime and it is always enjoyable to read about characters who are developing their friendships.

- The Children's Book of British Life
The author of this intriguing and often humorous guide to British children's lives is an avowed fan of the children's author D. H. Laurence's ""Twelve and Half"" and believes that the lives of children have not changed significantly in seventy years. Here, he sets out to prove his thesis by offering his own anecdotes and views on matters such as school, church, pets, chores, and holidays.
- What's Up, Doc?
Susan Stamberg interviews Dr. Seuss. In this interview, Dr. Seuss discusses how he became interested in making books for children, his feelings about being honored with the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, how he works up his stories, and his personal philosophy on children's books.

C1,"P. D. James Barbara Michaels meets the acclaimed crime writer whose innocent exterior hides a complex and brilliant imagination. Best-selling crime writer P.D. James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase as a headmistress of a girls' school. Indeed, one of her most enduring characters, Adam Dalgliesh, is a poet-cum-detective who investigates murders while taking time to write his own verse. The two sit in her office which resembles the study of a distinguished don, complete with bookshelves running floor to ceiling. This room has witnessed countless fictional crimes, and the walls are adorned with photographs of the likes of Sidney Nolan and Joan Collins. The room is also furnished with the very items James has chosen for her own deathbed. ""I am not afraid of dying but I would like to die in my own home,"" she says in her slow, gentle voice. ""I have a great fear of hospitals. I don't like the idea of people in white coats with their hands on me, which is a very good reason for not dying in hospital. ""I would love to die with a book in my hand,"" she says firmly. ""I would also like my glasses on because I would want to see to the end. ""Her voice, I note, is as impeccable as her manners, her handshake firm. Her eyes are clear and intelligent, as green as young leaves, and her demeanour is unflappable. I am rather taken aback by the thought of her, in a moment of mortal crisis, wanting to keep her glasses on in order to continue reading. I suppose that I"
C1,"Great sports Women on a winning streak To excel in any sport is hard enough even far men but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records.

The Women’s Indian Football Team is not new to challenges. They have battled both on and off the field. With the support of their family, friends, and the All India Football Federation, they have been making strides in their sport and have become a beacon of hope and inspiration for other aspiring female athletes.

To many, football means watching the English Premier League or the Spanish La Liga. A sport in which men from across the globe are in awe of the skills and physicality of their favourite players. But football is not only a ‘male-dominated’ sport. Women across the globe are breaking barriers and making a name for themselves in football.

##### The Women’s Indian Football team has done wonders over the past couple of years:

The Women’s team has had the privilege of playing in the South Asian Games (2010) and the Asian Football Championship (2012), the qualifier for the Olympics. They have won the South Asian Games twice and have been runners-up for the Asian Football Championship.

One of the biggest hurdles facing the team has always been infrastructure. But now, with the establishment of the new Football Academy in Goa, they have an opportunity to train at world-class facilities, giving them the best possible environment to develop and grow.

The National Camp in Goa has given the women footballers the much-needed"

""Was he crazy?"" ""He was or he wasn't. Doesn't matter to me. The thing is I'm going to get paid. I'm going to get my money. And that is the truth. There will be a payment. I can smell the payment, I can feel the payment."" ""Mr. Phelan is dead."" ""Is he? I don't believe him. He just wants to get rid of me.""

I'm not sure who I should blame. It was not my plan to ruin Mr. Phelan's house but it happened. The house was locked up with no one home. I should have left it like that. Instead, I broke in and vandalized it. Now the house is covered with graffiti and broken glass. There was no one in the house when I did it. But, I should have never done it.

The problem with the lock is that I never made a copy of it. The problem with my wallet is that I never put money in it. And the problem with my heart is that I never opened it to you. I'm going to have a hard time sleeping tonight. If I didn't have such a hard time sleeping at all, I would have never been here to begin with. I wish I never knew what you look like.

'What now?’ was my immediate thought as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‘open farm’ six years ago we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals.

We now have sheep, pigs, ducks, geese, horses, donkeys, goats, cows, pheasants and a red deer, as well as a host of other exotic creatures. Our farm is open to visitors all year round, and we’re passionate about teaching them the joys of farming and countryside living.

This was how I found myself with a confused boxer dog that had been left at the farm one evening. The dog’s owner had been killed in an accident and his girlfriend didn’t know what to do with the animal, so she brought him to us.

I wanted to reassure the animal so I called him Rusty. He was a great-looking dog and he seemed to be enjoying his new surroundings, so I thought we’d keep him for a few weeks until something more permanent could be arranged.

At that stage, our farm was already quite bustling, and we needed to make sure Rusty fitted in with the rest of the animals. We gave him some space of his own in one of the stables, and he soon started to enjoy"

The most important are those that run in newspapers and magazines with a wide readership - The Guardian, the FT, the Daily Mail and the Sunday Times. However, the most effective are reviews in books sections that target readers and enthusiasts. Publisher B Reviews are crucial and essential. Good reviews in the right places can make all the difference - but the effect of bad reviews, or no reviews at all, can be equally damaging. Publishers always lobby journalists for reviews, but the most important role of the reviewer is as a public servant to help a book find its audience. Publisher C Reviews are vitally important. They can drive readers to the bookstore. On the other/ The Independent and the Telegraph have been very good to us recently, though we would be equally happy to see more reviews in some other papers. If a book doesn't receive any attention at all it is very difficult to get the book moving in the right direction. Publisher D Publicists lobby as best they can to secure reviews, though they rarely succeed. Publishers and authors would like to think they make a big difference but, sadly, I doubt it very much. Publisher E Reviews can, of course, make a real difference. A bad one in the Times Literary Supplement can cause the book to be withdrawn from the market. A good one in a broad"
C1,"WEATHERVANE MAKER THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham’s designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. He uses copper and other light metals for his work, then he employs the ancient techniques of hand filing, soldering and hammering before adding a coating of traditional patina to finish the weathervanes. Graham’s work can be seen at various fairs and shows in the UK, or by appointment. Weather Vanes by Graham Smith can be contacted on 01494 782342 or by email at gsmith@dial.pipex.com.

The weathervane shown on this page is one of Graham’s favourites. The design is based on the English Rose, and as can be seen, it has been weathered to a beautiful colour that will enhance any location it’s set in.

As with any bespoke craftsman, Graham can create individual designs to meet your requirements. This weathervane, for example, was made in the likeness of a customer’s dog!

You can also ask Graham to incorporate the design of a family crest, such as this one.

Graham Smith’s work can often be seen at shows and fairs around the UK.  The photograph at the top of the page is an example of how weathervanes are displayed on location.

Graham’s work is not only appreciated by private customers but is also used by architects to enhance building designs.

C1,"But he most regretted his denials that the industry aimed its advertising at teenagers. ""We spent millions studying kids. We knew that they could name the three most advertised brands of cigarettes. We knew that almost 90 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands. And we knew that if we stopped advertising to the teens, our sales would drop. But we could never quite make the jump. We just couldn't say it out loud."" ""What if we had?"" I asked. ""It would have set off alarm bells all over the country. Congress would have said, 'Eurekal Now we've got them.' They would have been all over us and we would have had to do something. So we couldn't say it. We couldn't allow ourselves to think it.

Warner, ""Smoke: A History of Smoking, p. 302-303.)

The above quote from the former CEO of the Philip Morris Company, Kenneth L.

As I did not know what else to do and as I was getting chilly in spite of the fire, I took up one of the books on the table. It was the Memoirs of Julius Caesar by a person of the name of Baron de Wette. I read till the clerk brought in some papers which he put before me.

British long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain’s top 10,000-metre runners, is to visit the country’s most famous mountain and the high-altitude training camp in search of the secrets of Kenyan’s legendary long-distance running abilities.

Nerurkar is keen to get in on the action and learn how the Kenyans manage their successes. The British star was keen to learn more about the Kenyans’ secret of success in the long-distance running.

He will be visiting Kenya on an ambitious three-week long high altitude training plan which involves climbing up to a height of 5,000 metres above sea level and running on rough, challenging mountain trails, with a goal of enhancing his running abilities as he prepares for the European Athletics Championships.

Nerurkar said that it is a fantastic opportunity to be here at Mount Kenya. We are fortunate to be here where the Kenyans have trained so much. It is important for all of us to learn how they have managed to improve their running performances.

C1,"THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should combine old and new says Tom Cunliffe. And he put it into practice in his own craft 'The Westerman'. This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. The Westerman, my own boat, is 21 years old. On paper, she has a similar hull shape to the modern ones on show and she may well benefit from some of their new systems. She has no GPS, radar, electronic navigation, or self steering. No electric winches or water-maker. No generator or refrigeration, no in-mast or boom furling. 0 But she has a classic design, is stable, slow-moving, easy to sail, and will carry an enormous amount of food. No self-steering, you say? But she has a tiller and rudder which can be steered with a tiller extension 50 feet long. So where do I draw the line? What exactly does it take to turn her into a proper 'yacht'? The problem for a modern yacht designer is that the public want new ideas and the old ways. The yachts have to meet the demands of the 21st century, yet maintain the essence of classic design. But they also have to be good sailing boats that can be handled by a single person, and the designer needs to allow for the vagaries of different weather conditions and the need for some long-term comforts. The challenge for the designer is to combine these elements in a way that feels right. The Westerman, for example, has a traditional keel and long fin. Her rudder is mounted"
C1,"Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards. The two types of hedgehog found in Britain are the Western Hedgehog and the Eastern Hedgehog.

Habitats and Food Hedgehogs are opportunistic feeders which means they will eat almost anything, their diet is mainly invertebrates. They also eat berries and vegetables and can be opportunist predators of small mammals, birds, amphibians and other insects. They make their homes in a variety of places.

Favourite Food – Caterpillars

Reproduction Hedgehogs are normally solitary animals but they can come together to mate between August and December. After mating, the female hedgehog creates a nest, where she will give birth to between 4 and 8 babies called hoglets. Hoglets are blind when born and feed on their mothers milk for the first 4-6 weeks.

Life Span
Hedgehogs have a lifespan of up to 7 years.

Population and Conservation
It is thought that the number of hedgehogs in the UK has decreased by about a third since 2000. The main reasons for this are habitat loss, roads, and the decrease in insect prey populations. Hedgehogs are now protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

C1,"Blacksmiths THROUGHOUT the ages iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers because they were the sole providers of weapons armour and farming tools.

Blacksmiths can trace their occupational history back to a time when men forged metal with the use of fire stone and hammer. They are the progenitors of the metallurgists and chemists of today.

They work with fire in a way that most humans could never imagine and have an intimate knowledge of the metallurgical world. They can see heat. When their work is red-hot they can actually watch the material transform into a plastic-like mass.

They heat it to a specific temperature to give it specific qualities. With the touch of a hand they can determine if the metal is red hot or if it is just glowing orange.

They can look at a horse shoe nail and tell you how long it takes to forge it and how much it will cost. They can take a piece of steel and by heating and cooling it many times they can create a tool that can take more punishment than a hard wood tree.

Throughout history blacksmiths have been at the center of community life. They worked in the village as a service to the rest of the people and in return the people supplied them with material to work. Their craft was so integral to the community that some smiths were given a position of respect and authority as the ""smits"" in the old Dutch city of Amsterdam.

Blacksmiths played a major part in the development of the nation and the economy. They made the necessary tools"

As you wander along the cobbled Royal Mile in the heart of historic Edinburgh, Scotland's capital, The Tartan Museum looms into view. A bold, new structure, it rears up out of the old city like a lump of molten metal suddenly crystallising into shape. A couple of gleaming cheese-wedge shapes, made of blue and green glass and steel, rise up from the ground, making it almost impossible to miss.

Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Dr Toby Clark at the British Geological Survey wants to retrace Halley's quest to chart compass variations across the UK. A former Royal Air Force radar officer, Dr Clark also has a passion for historical research. Photograph: John Stokes In 1700 Sir Edmund Halley embarked on an ambitious project to survey compass variations across the whole of Britain. The mathematician and astronomer, who is best known for the comet that bears his name, was determined to establish a national standard for magnetic compasses, which would allow sailors to chart their courses accurately. Halley and his team of 15 observers had travelled thousands of miles by coach, taking measurements in far-flung reaches of the country. From the coast of Cornwall to the Firth of Forth in Scotland, Halley used a specially designed iron compass, or a terrella, to measure the deviation of the compass needle from magnetic north. He was seeking true north. The results were recorded on two maps, one showing the line of true north and the other the line of magnetic north. In the two and a half centuries since Halley's death, the Earth's magnetic field has shifted substantially and his maps have long been obsolete. But Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to retrace the survey in an attempt to understand more about the historical changes in Britain's"

C1,"Photographing People People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations the photographer has to be conscious of actions gestures and expressions. The same rules don't apply to everyone in the picture. A child can be at the peak of their activity in a brief moment while an adult in a serious pose can be unresponsive. The photographer must recognize the right moment to capture the best image. A portrait of someone is most often the image of their face. As such the photographer must recognize the importance of eyes and expression on their face. The facial structure shape of the face and the features are important in determining the success of the photograph of a person. The composition of the photograph is important. This includes the size of the person within the picture and what is around them. A good photograph will often convey more than just the subject itself. The location, props or background within the frame often helps to tell the story. It's important that the photographer be conscious of how these things can help to tell the story. To succeed in photography you must know how to work with people. It is important that you develop the ability to communicate well with everyone. This is one of the most important skills a photographer must develop to be successful. It's not just about talking to the subject but about reading people. A successful portrait often tells a story. A story of the subject that is compelling to the audience. In photography it's all about telling a story and engaging the viewer. Successful photographers are good at drawing the viewer in to their images.

One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. She has been rudely interrupted by someone who needs attention immediately: an angry young boy with a broken door lock. Sue Brown appears to be the kind of woman who could, at a pinch, be mistaken for a saint. She has, after all, devoted her life to 'helping' hoteliers to improve their hotels. She even takes pains to learn all about the individual hotels before each show, so as to be better able to help the hoteliers and to avoid embarrassing them on air. But if this is a saint in search of a church, I am not sure where the congregation might be. Sue Brown's latest television series, The Hotel Inspector, sees her visit one hotel at a time to judge its quality, standards and value for money, making recommendations for improvement where she feels necessary. The hotelier's dilemma is that they can either take her advice or appear on the show and have their weaknesses exposed to their customers. It is a lose-lose situation, for as Sue explains, there are no cash rewards attached to the improvements her advice would encourage. She does, however, offer her services to help implement the changes, which makes her appear all the more saintly. But there are a few things about Sue's sainthood, however, that don't quite stack up.

C1,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support If you applied for a job in some countries you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting as much as anything else that would determine your suitability for the job. In an increasingly computerised world, it is remarkable that handwriting analysis remains a very real and serious profession. Graphology, as it is known, was founded by the French psychologist Frederic Rochat in 1870 and is now used by multinational corporations, the military and police forces in various parts of the world, as well as the intelligence and security services.

The United States Secret Service, for example, uses handwriting analysis as one of its investigative tools. While handwriting may provide a useful snapshot of someone’s character, many of the claims made on its behalf have been challenged. Some psychologists and psychiatrists are more sceptical, but that doesn’t seem to have done much to slow down the growth of the profession. It is used extensively for employment purposes, although the way in which it is interpreted can vary enormously.

For some companies handwriting analysis is just a supplementary aid to more formal tests and interviews. For others it may be crucial. Some of the world’s leading corporations employ handwriting analysts on a full-time basis to vet potential employees. This is not just a question of style or form, but an examination of the script itself. But what exactly does it reveal? Some companies may use it to assess things such as a person’s creativity, their ability to fit into a team, their honesty, stability and so on.

In this respect, its significance appears to be minimal and its impact limited. B. There are two sides to this coin: On the one hand, volunteer tourism does appear to foster global awareness and help volunteers form positive opinions of foreign cultures and societies. On the other hand, it can also expose people to a foreign culture in an artificial context that is unrelated to their everyday life. C. Therefore, some people say that it may contribute to tourism and not development. However, proponents maintain that it does help to support development. D. The debate over the role of volunteer tourism has gone on for years, and will most likely continue well into the future.

## volunteer tourism

The topic of international voluntary work has been under debate among scholars and development experts for many years. Some people maintain that volunteer tourism contributes to development and global understanding. Others argue that it is more beneficial for personal growth and cultural awareness than it is for development. In this essay, I will discuss the arguments presented by both sides.

It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. In this respect, its significance appears to be minimal and its impact limited. Volunteer tourism can provide assistance to local communities and contribute to development efforts. However, critics maintain that the impact of volunteer tourism is often small and can be overshadowed by the more significant effects of other forms of"

The University Museum of Classical Archaeology The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This collection is one of the most important in the world.

The Museum of Classical Archaeology focuses primarily on classical Greece and Rome, but also on the Etruscan and Pre-Roman Civilisations. This collection contains copies of sculptures from around the ancient world, including Greece, Rome, Egypt, and other regions in the ancient Mediterranean world.

The collection is divided into four main sections:

I. A Greek Section
This section contains the largest and one of the most famous group of sculptures in the Museum. It is the replica of the Parthenon frieze.

II. An Egyptian Section
This section contains copies of ancient Egyptian sculptures.

III. A Roman and Etruscan Section
This section contains copies of sculptures from Rome and Etruria, and a selection of early Christian sarcophagi from Rome.

IV. A Section of Modern Restorations
This section contains copies of sculptures from modern times, including some works of classical inspiration.

B. The Ashmolean Museum

C1,"Are you too nice for your own good? When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity. 'I'm so sorry' I beamed when I dropped the plate on the floor and it smashed into smithereens. 'I'm sure it was no trouble at all', I simpered as the angry customer threw bread rolls at me after I had forgotten his special request for extra toast. The customer service training I received taught me all about 'damage limitation', and it was here that I first learnt about the concept of being 'too nice'.

So, is it possible to be 'too nice'? I'm sure you've all met the kinds of people who, even though they mean well, actually drive you mad with their constant need to be helpful, their sweet, overbearing smiles and their inability to say no. And, as hard as it is to admit, we've all been there. So, if being too nice is so widely recognised, why do we still do it and how do we stop?

## The dangers of being too nice

The dangers of being too nice lie in the fact that it may lead to a loss of self-respect and personal identity. When we're 'too nice', we tend to neglect our own needs and wishes in the interests of pleasing others. We're so concerned with being liked that we don't stand up for ourselves or assert our rights, and we might even go to great lengths to make other people happy. This can lead to a lack of confidence and a diminished sense of self-worth, which in turn causes resentment. The more we neglect our"

The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964 a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. A big metal tube. With the promise of weightlessness and plenty of g-force, the students were excited. I saw the plane. I knew it had been used as an office, a restaurant, a bar and a classroom, said Tahir Morshed. It was like a normal flight, but then he took a really hard turn and I was pushed into the ceiling. I heard this really loud bang and he turned off the engines. We were in zero gravity. I got really scared and I was crying because I wasnt sure if we were going to come down or if we were going to crash. There was a lot of screaming and yelling because there was just no gravity. The pilot told them they could perform experiments in this rare environment. The group had been selected by NASA to help research the effects of zero gravity on the human body and its impact on bone and muscle density. I couldnt move. I felt like I was just floating around. When he turned the engines back on, it felt like I was going to hit the ceiling or the floor. In fact, my teammate was hanging upside down, Morshed said. There was panic initially, but it didnt last very long. Once the students got used to the feeling, they began testing scientific theories on human behaviour. The pilot was very patient and he kept telling us to stay calm, Morshed said. The most common problem for a rookie astronaut in space"

C1,"Hit and miss of mass marketing AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. It seems odd to say this at a time when advertisers, like everyone else, are wringing their hands at the gloomy economic outlook. Yet that is the only way to explain the apparent contradiction between a recession that, in economic terms, is still relatively mild, and the very serious advertising downturn.

Marc Sautet, editor of the advertising trade paper, The Sautet Report, has produced a useful analysis of this gloomy situation.

He points out that there are two levels at which the advertising industry has not been keeping up with the times. The first is an old, familiar problem that dates back to the mid-1970s: advertising is getting through to fewer and fewer people. Advertisers have long known that they are suffering from a gradual erosion of the size of their audience, and they have done nothing to stop the decline.

The second level of failure is that it seems to be almost impossible for advertisers to find new ways to reach people with messages that will have some chance of making them buy something. This is what has been going on during the past 12 months. In this situation, the advertising industry has simply thrown up its hands in despair and proclaimed a crisis in advertising.

But this is not the sort of thing that can be fixed by simply adopting a different advertising strategy. Sautet argues that the problems run much deeper than"

It wasn’t so long ago that reporters would be sent to cover a news event, armed with notepad and pen, to jot down notes and later transcribe onto paper. Mobile phones were just for calling and not for texts, emails or downloading information on the go.

With the rise of digital journalism, the media landscape has changed dramatically, with journalists now working with laptops, smartphones, voice recorders and myriad apps for reporting. The internet is now the main source of news for a growing number of people, while print sales continue to decline.

My name is Georgina McGuinness and, as a result of these changes, I decided to step back from a long career in news journalism to take a break. I was a producer with an RTÉ television programme for eight years. That was followed by a role as the head of communications and media for the HSE which was a very challenging but fascinating experience.

In 2011, I left the HSE to look after my two young children, aged five and seven at the time. My husband, Fergal, has been my rock and my best friend for 20 years. He was very supportive of my decision to step away from my career.

C1,"POWER DRESSING EVERY SUMMER the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance?

Charles Darwin

Darwin had two things to say about the peacock's tail. First, he saw the tail as an elaborate waste of energy; a luxury, a non-essential appendage that would do no more than make the peacock a slow and easy target for predators. And, second, he saw it as a weapon, a show of threat. Its size and flamboyance would send a clear signal to a rival that the male holding this train was a fierce competitor.

But then a second problem arose. How did the peacock use its tail? Darwin could see the male flaunting his plumage to the females, as the females were known to be quite partial to a large train. But how did he use it against other males? Darwin was not the first to witness peacocks engaging in what was then known as ‘pea-cock-ing’, and he was able to offer an explanation: the train, which appears so large and so unwieldy, is in fact remarkably nimble, allowing the bird to move the feathers about with startling rapidity.

The mystery Darwin faced was not so much why peacocks had developed the trait (females prefer mates with large trains), but why the birds moved the plumage in the way they did. For Darwin, the explanation was that the train is used as a weapon, something"
C1,"NATURAL TALENTS In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees we haven’t had time to develop any differences: genetically we’re still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps. On this grand evolutionary scale whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. So in this gallery we take a look at those talents that animals share with humans and which have been finely honed over millions of years.

1. SPRINGING INTO ACTION
Many animals can jump and bound with ease, taking advantage of the way their bodies bend and compress to produce powerful and controlled propulsion. Humans excel at this thanks to our opposable thumbs and perfect musculature, but we’re not alone: kangaroos can jump as high as 10 metres and deer are also natural jumpers.

2. NIGHT-TIME NAVIGATION
There are a few species of animal able to navigate their way around at night, and humans are no exception. Our eyes contain the light-sensitive photoreceptor rods that detect low levels of light, especially blue wavelengths, and adapt to darkness to help us see in the dark. Many animals, however, such as moths and certain species of bird, have similar adaptations.

3. EXPLORING WITH SENSES
Animals, like humans, have to rely on the data available to them through their senses in order to make their way through the world. Humans hear well across a wide frequency range with our ears. But for detecting vibrations and movement, we’re not alone; elephants have excellent hearing, while dolphins can detect vibrations through the water.

'Is there any danger?' She looked apprehensively down the cliff towards the water. 'And you have not told me, or perhaps you do not know yourselves, whether there is a dale under the water.'

'No dale and no danger,' the controller answered. 'The pool is quite safe. No one has ever drowned here.' 'Oh, that's good,' Lenina cried, her colour returning. 'I simply cannot swim.'

C1,"Chewing gum culture It’s fashionable classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day. Discover how an ancient custom became big business. Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. If you ask somebody what he does for a living and he says he makes chewing gum, you’re likely to think of a small, family-run business and the sound of chewing gum being wrapped in cellophane. But today’s chewing gum is big business, a $10 billion-a-year industry with 11,000 different products ranging from Wrigley’s Juicy Fruit to Altoids mints. The first chewing gum factory in the world was built by Thomas Adams in New York in 1871. Adams was a photography pioneer, but found that his stock of gum base, a by-product of the bituminous coal business, was more useful than his camera-produced images. In 1871, Adams introduced the first flavored chewing gum in the US, and soon he was selling 300,000 sticks a day. Today his company, the Adams Gum Company, is one of the biggest in the industry, and the name “Wrigley’s” almost as synonymous with chewing gum as Kleenex is with tissues.

C1,"Beginner Takes All Even before it was published The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph The first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer and aspiring director. He had just turned 32 and was struggling to get his scripts produced, while a screenplay for a sequel to the British hit movie The Whistle Blower was floundering. Then, in May 1994, Evans received a phone call that would change his life. At the other end was Barry Avrich an old schoolmate whom Evans had not seen for some years. Avrich was living in Canada and was the producer of a television series about horses. When he told Evans about a story he wanted to dramatise it reminded Evans of something he had thought about more than a decade before. But Evans was working on a film adaptation of his first novel, The Horse Whisperer, and he did not have enough time. So he gave Avrich another idea: the script he had been writing for The Whistle Blower sequel. After the call Evans continued writing the novel and he found himself fascinated by the story and was soon captivated. The Horse Whisperer came out in May 1995. Its hero is a man called Tom Booker, who possesses a magical ability to communicate with horses. In a dramatic narrative thread that twists through the lives of his family, friends and a young girl called Annie, a traumatised horse owner with whose father he falls in love, the novel follows Booker as he helps to save the troubled horses and people around him.

C1,"THEATRE CHARLES SPENCER A. Tamburlaine the Great Marlowe’s ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands’ staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe’s play with an exhilarating speed and physicality. This modern retelling has a strong, sensual cast and is as exciting to watch as an Anthony Eden war film. Charles Spencer, 11 August 2014, Sunday Times

There are several scenes where the whole cast and chorus are on stage at the same time and the play never loses momentum in the telling. The story of Tamburlaine, who wants to conquer the world, is well told with the aid of a bare stage and a strong chorus, as well as with a simple and atmospheric set (designers are James Cotterill and Paul Lawrence). The actors give full value to the language with their voices. I was left with the feeling that I would gladly come back for more of Marlowe’s work, especially with such a strong cast and chorus. G. Smyth, 11 August 2014, British Theatre.com

Theatre Charles Spencer The cast is as diverse as the play’s themes with an impressive line-up of talent: John Mackay in the title role as the ruthless, ambitious warrior; John Hurt as the witty Fama (Personification of Fame); Michael Pennington as the manipulative Zenocrate; Tim McInnerny as Scilla, Tamburlaine’s devoted wife; Niamh Cusack as Barsine, Zenocrate’s sister who Tamburlaine rapes.

C1,"The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It’s a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless that is it is newspapers’ ‘transition’ to the online world an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process – because frankly it may not be a process at all. We will not, as a species, read print newspapers, or magazines, for much longer, and the sooner the realisation hits home the better. We will print them, of course – for a dwindling and ageing audience, in ever-decreasing numbers – but the essence of the medium has gone and isn’t coming back. For a start, we are too impatient, and too connected to the news wires, for the lag time of 24 hours (at least) between gathering and being gathered up. We are too attached to our iPods for not being able to carry vast libraries. We are too addicted to online crosswords for no longer being able to reach across a page to scratch numbers into a paper square. We are too wedded to the idea of free speech and interactive discussion in comments columns and forums. There’s a world out there, full of digital wonder. But if newspapers want to survive, their owners must admit that their ‘product’ is not what it was, and the ‘market’ has turned, and that the whole thing needs ripping up and starting again. The old, old joke is that it’s tough to make a living from newspapers these days, when it’s so easy to make a living from a murder. If you don’t think that has been amplified online, you haven’t been paying attention. It may be hard to imagine that in 20 years,"

I arrive at his workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. Yet in his early fifties, Hurst is something of a legend within the small world of the UK furniture industry and one of only a handful of British master cabinet-makers. He has an instantly recognisable style which sets him apart from the mass-produced market in the UK and the modernists. 'I don't see myself as a designer,' he says. 'I am a cabinet-maker. I get inspired by the furniture I make, as it's very hard to say where your inspiration comes from.' Hurst started out with an apprenticeship with the legendary maker Sir Cecil Stephens and now has a reputation for craftsmanship that has attracted the attention of some of the best names in furniture from across the globe. What makes him most proud, however, is that his customers return. 'I've made everything from tables and chairs to large storage cabinets, beds and even a giant bookshelf for a private library at a university,' he says. 'But my pride is in my reputation. 'I have customers who have used me three and four times. If you make a piece of furniture for me you have to have crafted it yourself.

The first is Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral Southwell Minster celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. The second is that Britain’s greenest house is built next door to one of the filthiest polluters in Britain, which belches vast amounts of climate-warming and poisonous fumes out into the surrounding countryside and blighting the air the town breathes. The house is the home of the architect of Britain’s greenest building – and one of Europe’s most energy-efficient homes – which can generate its own electricity from the sun.

C1,"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West? Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism massage diet manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions but acupuncture’s role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West.

While there is no scientific explanation as to how acupuncture works, evidence suggests that it does. Many modern medical professionals have come to appreciate and incorporate acupuncture into a treatment plan. They see that it provides pain relief and an alternative to potentially habit-forming drugs and surgeries.

Acupuncture works to balance the body’s vital energies or qi. This energy flows through the body along pathways called meridians. When meridians become blocked or out of balance disease is the result. By inserting fine needles into specific points along these pathways an acupuncture practitioner can release this blockage and restore the balance of the vital energies.

During a treatment the patient may feel a slight pinch as the needles are inserted. However many feel relaxed and energized following treatment. Typically 5 to 20 needles are used during each session.

Acupuncture may be utilized on its own or as a complement to other traditional or western medical treatments. More and more insurance companies are recognizing the value of acupuncture and are beginning to cover it.

Though many practitioners can provide acupuncture anyone suffering from a medical condition should consult their doctor prior to undergoing treatment. It is essential to note that all acupuncturists are not trained in the same way. Ensure that your acupuncture practitioner has a certification from"
C1,"The December cover of Capitol Magazine featured Clay Carter looking rich and handsome in his expensive Armani suit. Inside there were pictures of him playing with a dog (borrowed from Rodney) standing proudly in empty courtrooms washing his new Porsche and standing on board his new boat in the Bahamas. The reality was a lot different.

Clay Carter was back in his office working overtime to pay off the IRS for back taxes. The money earned from his writing work was spent on attorney fees and the cost of a settlement from his previous lawsuit against his law firm. He hadn’t managed to get any dog but lived in a small apartment in Tulsa and his only luxury was his 1978 Toyota which he had inherited from his father. His savings barely covered the monthly bills.

In his second novel, John Grisham narrated the story of Clay Carter’s life in The Confession. The story is about a big law firm partner with a seemingly golden future who confesses to a murder he didn’t commit. The novel is both a courtroom drama and a suspenseful thriller which delves into the dark side of legal practice where ambition, betrayal, and guilt collide.

The story begins with Clay Carter a young lawyer at Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a prestigious law firm in Memphis. His life seems perfect, he has an expensive apartment, a Porsche car and a promising career as a trial lawyer. He is given an attractive case of a 16-year-old accused of murder, but his world starts falling apart after his mentor, Buddy Sparhawk is found dead in his car.

The image of freshness Supermarkets know from their market research that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. A study by the University of Cambridge found that if the image of the supermarket is one of freshness, then shoppers feel more comfortable spending. So, what better way of promoting a product that contains all these positive messages about freshness than using a live fruit display? While not all supermarkets have them, those that do will often have a basket of fruit in the middle of the aisle - one that is filled with tempting, ripe fruit. A study of British supermarket giant Tesco found that 47 per cent of customers were drawn to buy something - often something unplanned - at the 'impulse' stand. B. The wall of products The rows and rows of identical products stacked on high shelves are actually designed to create the illusion of space within the store. This is a cleverly contrived illusion because, as every shop owner knows, the more space you feel you have in a store, the more likely you are to make a purchase. In fact, the illusion can be so effective that you often won't even notice you've been tricked. So if, for example, you decide to take the time to stop, have a browse and buy a new bottle of moisturiser, you may well end up buying more because the illusion of space gives you the idea there is room in the car for one more item.

C1,"Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. Three popular theories are presented here but all remain hypotheses that are not fully established.

The Restoration theory Sleep restores the body’s energy levels. During sleep, metabolism slows and energy usage falls. This theory suggests that sleep allows the body to rest and recuperate in much the same way that it conserves energy by slowing metabolism during hibernation.

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence in support of the restoration theory is the fact that physical and mental activities increase sleep need. Athletes, for example, tend to sleep for longer periods of time and experience greater feelings of fatigue if they are deprived of sleep. Similarly, a student who has crammed for exams may feel more need for rest. Research has shown that deep stages of sleep (N3) increase significantly when subjects are deprived of sleep, indicating that the body is striving to meet increased energy demands during these periods of rest.

One weakness of the restoration theory is that not all energy conservation during sleep is convincing evidence for this explanation. It is true that during sleep body temperature declines and oxygen consumption falls but this also occurs when subjects are in a waking, resting state. Furthermore, the fact that physical and mental activity can raise sleep needs is not strong evidence that sleep functions to restore energy. For instance, eating does not need sleep to restore our energy. Instead, it directly provides us with energy.

C1,"Is your office working ok? Fresh air and the right chairs are the key to a happy healthy workforce according to a new survey. We went to four contrasting offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist who studies people’s working conditions; and an occupational psychologist.

We started in the small office where the bosses were worried about the amount of money they were paying for their staff to go to the gym and keep fit.

There was good reason for this. We had our building health consultant with us for the day and he took measurements for carbon dioxide, temperature and humidity.

What he found was there was very little fresh air circulating in the room. You could feel it too, there was stuffiness and it felt really closed in.

Our ergonomist was really worried about the chairs the staff were sitting on as well. The chairs didn’t fit all their bodies properly.

So, staff were having to sit in discomfort in a room which was stuffy and with poor air quality. The building health consultant felt they needed to have more fresh air in the room. The psychologist said the environment was depressing. The ergonomist would have suggested all sorts of different chairs so they could sit better.

We moved on to our next office and the building health consultant found that it didn’t have an extractor system, a fan to suck the air out. This might be a new one for you, and it’s a key point. He felt the temperature and humidity was very comfortable, so the building was well-built. But, the problem was that there were too many people in the office.

C1,"From here to paternity A. The theatre director Because of my bizarre personal life which I cannot be proud of I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. We’ve always considered ourselves lucky to have the children we have. Even the challenges.

So, today I feel blessed. I am a father and I will always treasure those years. And I will also treasure the day my children were conceived and their names and the day they were born. And I will always be there for them. I never wanted to be their father. I never wanted to have children. I always wanted to have my own life and a family for myself. But life is full of surprises.

When we first decided to have children, we had to think about it very carefully and pray to God for the right moment to have them. That was about seven years ago. Today, we have three children and one on the way. I feel like we’ve done a good job raising them. I feel like they’ve been given the right care, love, and attention.

I have always felt like I have been a good father. I have done everything I could to provide the best for my children. I am grateful for the privilege of being their father. I can’t imagine my life without them. I have been a father to them for a long time and I will always treasure the memories I have with them.

I have always had a strong belief in God and I believe that He has blessed me with my children. I believe that the gift of fatherhood is a wonderful gift and I will always appreciate it."
C1,"THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING I thought everyone would be pleased but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. ‘What do you mean?’ she raged. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day life-long smoker and four hours later I was not was faintly irritating.

So, I was thinking about my own experience and it made me wonder why people smoke and why they struggle to stop when the evidence on the harms of smoking is so overwhelming. This evidence is so overwhelming that my daughter who is a scientist is in charge of a research team studying the effects of smoke on premature babies. Now she is pregnant and I have told her never to smoke in my presence.

One of the reasons why she is not smoking is that she was so horrified to see one of my lungs in the hospital. I did not know when I was taken ill that it looked like half a loaf of bread with black grill marks. To be honest, it was not much better than an ashtray. It could hardly have been more grotesque. It was at the same moment I saw my black lung that I decided to give up smoking. I wish I had given up years before.

I do understand why people smoke. I smoked as a teenager because I had become a serious student. It was part of my rebellion. It was also a way of rebelling against authority; I smoked in secret – always three feet away from teachers and school officials who hated it when I smoked. At university I smoked like a chimney – I had become politically active and smoking was part of my political and academic stance. There was something slightly romantic about being an intellectual, political, smoker. It also seemed"
C2,"Writing by hand and on screen Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over.

It was through the encouragement of my father that I started to write. I remember my earliest efforts at a young age of five years. This, in those days, was quite remarkable given the amount of effort needed to keep a quill pen nib sharp and ink flowing.

My first piece of published writing was a small poem that featured in The Govan Press in Scotland. In those days, newspapers came out every few days, rather than every few hours. My second piece, written when I was eight years old, was a short story published in The Courier in Dundee. It featured the local zoo and its residents.

I remember how much effort it took to write by hand and how careful I had to be. Any mistake and the only way to correct it was to scratch it out and start again. No copying and pasting; no undo functions. I remember the feeling of relief after completing each line, knowing it was in the public domain and there was no turning back.

I also remember my mother’s pride when she showed my work to her friends. They asked how it all came to her so easily. I explained to them that I just loved the thought of seeing my name in print, with so many other people’s names.

I think it was from that early age that I recognised that writing was hard and that good writing came from hard work. It also helped me understand that writing is not"
C2,"Philadelphia Avenue I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened the humidity thickened into a palpable prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. My gait was slow and I was constantly looking down, but not at the cement or pavement. My attention, in a way, was above ground, albeit not of the earth. In this respect, I was not alone in my sojourn. My companion was an ethereal entity who seemed to be woven into the fabric of the evening, a silent companion that would emerge with a subtle spectral swell that would rise and sink with the rhythm of my footfalls. I thought about how I had come to be a witness to these strange circumstances, not so much as they were happening in the here and now, but more as the residual echoes of my past self, a long dead entity that remained forever engrained in the tapestry of my present being. But was it merely a past event that remained inscribed in my psychic psyche as a haunted echo? Or was it something more, something that lingered just out of reach, on the brink of a dimension that remained ever tantalizingly beyond the threshold of conscious awareness? I paused at the intersection of Park Place and Philadelphia Avenue and looked toward the light at the corner of this otherwise eerie intersection. The dusk had fallen to darkness.

C2,"Einstein Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist and the chances are they’ll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias. And he’s up there with Darwin and Newton as a famous British cultural icon, alongside Shakespeare and Dickens.

The man who had a huge impact on our understanding of the physical world might have had trouble getting a job in a research university today. Many biologists do not believe in evolution, nor do they understand quantum physics.

What’s more, universities are often more interested in how many citations a scientist receives and how many students they can attract than in the intellectual calibre of the scientist. Einstein, who worked mainly in his spare time and with no grant for most of his career, could not get a job in a British research university today.

I was a member of a committee set up to select candidates for the professorship of physics at the University of Cambridge. One of the major criteria was the number of papers a candidate had published. How many grants they had received as a post-doctoral fellow was also crucial, even though the candidate had a permanent job at the time of application. Einstein would not have come anywhere near the top, and it is questionable if he would have made the final shortlist.

There would also have been trouble with the fact that he left school at 15 and only attended university at 18 for a year. The education system of today is set up to reward the conventional with higher grades and it is difficult for the unconventional to do well.

There are literally hundreds of books available to the amateur astronomer, from simple books on the constellations through to the most complex books on variable stars, galaxies, and so forth. Even magazines and newsletters abound.

Today the most popular observing activity is photographing the night sky. With the advent of the digital camera, it is relatively simple and inexpensive. A digital camera and telescope can be had for under $1000 (1000 euros, pounds etc). There are also some astronomical photography magazines, which have a number of articles, tutorials, and reviews of equipment. You can learn a great deal about the night sky and photography at the same time.

Telescope basics
The basic types of telescopes are; refracting (lenses), reflecting (mirrors) and radio. The majority of telescopes that amateurs use today are of the reflecting type and come in the form of the Newtonian Reflector or the Schmidt-Cassegrain. (Both are shown in diagrams on this page.) There are some refractors about, the most popular type of which are the achromatic refractor.

C2,"Art In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique revolutionary shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago. The history of our era of modern art has been the history of the artist as a self-conscious rebel against convention; as a daring innovator with a mission to change the world. Art in our time has come to symbolize our most rebellious impulses as a society. We celebrate art as an expression of our desire to be different and to shock people, to say to others ""we are different, we are wild, we won't be told what to do"".

However, art has been used for a very long time in a far more conventional manner. It has generally served the purpose of portraying some kind of objective reality. In the great tradition of portraiture and historical painting, artists have always been asked to record the events, the people, and the places of their times. The most admired artists throughout history were not rebels but rather those who had mastered techniques and disciplines. They were seen as great craftsmen, whose skills were used to beautify our environment and to record our experiences and memories in a lasting form.

Modern artists - like Picasso - who rebelled against convention were in fact few in number. The world would be a poorer place if these artists had not produced their iconoclastic works which have been so loved and admired. They were pioneers in a new direction of expression and they have been highly significant in the development of modernism in the twentieth century. But, if"
C2,"Fashion Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point. They have good reason to do so: from the end of the sixteenth century onwards, there are more detailed descriptions of clothing than ever before, and these descriptions contain explicit comparisons and evaluations of various styles and modes of dressing, and it is in this sense that we can begin to talk about 'fashions'.

The earliest fashion commentaries are to be found in courtly writings, especially those emanating from French courts. Some commentaries of this period also mention regional differences in dress - the first of many instances of 'national dress' which in the eighteenth century begin to take on much greater importance. In the second half of the seventeenth century, the term 'fashion' itself comes into use in reference to clothing, and by the eighteenth century it is common.

### 'Fashioning'

Fashioning, however, is more than a simple economic or political phenomenon; for fashion (if we may use this term to encompass style, dress, clothes) is a social practice that enables the creation of individual and social identities. The 'fashioning' of an identity involves not only decisions about clothing and appearance but also about status, gender, age, health, body shape and form. The body as 'living' material is fashioned in various ways that express aspects of the individual and social experience. The body is shaped by fashionable clothing as well as by the social conventions of dress and"
C2,"Metals It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. Such glimpses of a new kind of material would have caused him to think. He would pick it up, examine it and then perhaps make a hole in the stone to hang on a string as a decorative charm. He might have been disappointed with this kind of jewel but he did not give up so easily. There was a sense of new discovery that could not be so easily dismissed.

Metals are a unique subset of substances on the face of the earth. These are substances that are hard, shiny, easily polished and capable of reflecting a clear image. Most of the metals are highly conductive to heat and electricity. They are so well known because they glitter and are visible at a distance. Our ancestors might have started to search for more such glittering stones in the rivers, on the hills and in the rocks but they probably found little apart from the shiny pebbles that had already come their way.

The discovery of fire would have given them the first means of working with metals. The heat caused by fire would be necessary for turning pebbles into tools but it was still a long way from this first step to the fashioning of useful metal objects. After much trial and error our Stone Age ancestors would have learned that the only way to produce the necessary heat for this purpose is by forging the stone in an intense flame.

In the beginning, they must have hammered the stone in search of new"
C2,"The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. And the way I played around with it was my reality. On this particular trip to Vienna, I was there to photograph an exclusive event. It wasn’t the first, and it certainly would not be the last. In all honesty, the event itself was something I didn’t particularly care for. It was a symphony concert featuring a newly composed piece of music by a composer I’d never heard of, and performed by musicians I had never heard of either. This was the assignment given to me by my boss, and it would have been unwise for me to decline. He had been generous with the budget on this one, which included a luxury suite in one of the best hotels in the city, and an open bill for whatever I wished to photograph and whatever I wanted to photograph it with. It was almost a dream assignment for a photographer like me who sought the thrill of new experiences more than anything else. Almost. The only thing that was lacking, in my humble opinion, was the music itself. It just had to be the worst piece of music ever composed. So much so, that it was enough to make me contemplate handing in my notice to the agency. Even if it meant forsaking the opulence I was currently enjoying. Now, it wasn’t the piece itself that I disliked. It was the pretentiousness that surrounded it. The entire ensemble was an exhibition of how money and privilege could purchase the tr"
C2,"Enough Sleep? Tiredness it is often claimed has become the modern condition. As the richer busier countries have grown so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings.

So why do so many people feel they aren’t getting enough sleep? One view is that we should no longer have problems sleeping because, as a species, human beings have been doing it since time immemorial. Surely evolution must have equipped us to sleep well enough to avoid problems? It’s also important to understand that sleeplessness is a complex and multi-causal phenomenon, the causes of which will be considered below.

In the last few years of the 20th century researchers have also argued that insomnia has become a major health problem for an increasingly urbanized world. According to these studies people in the west are working harder and sleeping less. There is a popular belief that modern technology and the 24-hour society have disrupted the circadian rhythm, which controls sleep and waking.

Modern technology has many advantages but there are drawbacks including the erosion of the importance of a good night’s rest. Some people believe that we should all be able to adapt to a world in which 24-hour TV and nighttime working are commonplace and that there should be less focus on what is a natural part of human life.

There are a number of reasons why we may experience sleep-related problems. Among these are:

C2,"Air-conditioning There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer’s unusually high temperatures the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so in fact that at quiet times the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. The chilly temperatures and high winds leave some of the more delicate City folk shaking.

On the TV A documentary about the history of the BBC – its rise from a small group of enthusiastic workers in the backyard shed, to the 5,000 strong international operation it is today. It is hard to imagine how a little organisation, with the likes of John Peel, Kirsty Wark and Rolf Harris as its original workforce, could have grown into the global media giant we know today. It’s not that these people lack talent, but rather they have a lot of competition.

In the paper A headline article in today’s Daily Express concerns the death of the Queen’s corgis. There are various different stories about how they died. The one that appears in the Express has a number of holes in it. For instance, the article refers to a dog called Gizmo, which is not a corgi. The Queen has been criticised for allowing the dog’s owner to use a dog walking service that is linked to the Labour party. However, the Labour party claims there are no links to their party, and that the owners are friends of the Queen’s.

C2,"THE WELL I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched eyes wide fist to mouth as I winched up the well bucket steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. A momentary thrill, then I’d have to climb back out. There was no need to reassure you that I would call up for help if I started to feel claustrophobic. You’re the practical one and even if we’d been at loggerheads all day I’d not have wanted to disappoint you. It’s not that it was all over so much as the beginning of a journey towards a very specific destination. I lowered myself, claustrophobia’s chill already creeping at my neck and inching through my spine but I kept going, the darkness surrounding me, a world of possibilities.

C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day.  -James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

Joyce’s language here speaks volumes in just a few short sentences.  The “motionless hall” and the “momentary qualm of ownership” both speak to an unoccupied house, a house unlived in or uncared for. The “end of the day” is a common time for people to arrive home, making the phrase all the more poignant, and more evocative of loneliness.  There is a sense of a life that is transient, one that isn’t home, perhaps only rented or borrowed, and that doesn’t inspire much love or loyalty. It is a home-in-waiting, but not one where family photos line the walls or laughter echoes down the hall. This is a house that seems to yearn for life, a life that it isn’t granted.

The quote, however, has a bittersweetness as well. The house, while it is clearly lacking in warmth or comforts, seems to offer a kind of peace or solace in its quiet, empty state.

The house is “motionless,” implying that it offers a sort of stillness, a refuge from the chaos and activity of life. It may not have the loving occupants that make a home truly warm, but it offers an escape and a respite from"
C2,"Heritage The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously we feel connected to our personal heritage usually we know who and what our grandparents were and we will have heard stories about how they lived. We also have a deeper connection to the communities we grew up in, and have some knowledge of their history, their landmarks and events that have taken place in these communities. These connections are our heritage as they are all related to where we come from and the values that have been passed down to us from previous generations. Heritage plays a huge role in preserving our cultural identities, and without our heritage we would lose some of the most important traditions, values and experiences that have made us who we are today.  This is why it is vital to ensure that heritage is celebrated, preserved and protected. Heritage as defined in the context of this research is the set of physical, cultural, and social remnants of our ancestors. 3. 1. 3. 2. 3. 3. The physical aspects of heritage include architecture, landmarks and physical locations such as monuments or buildings. 3. 4. 3. 5. 4. 3. 6.

C2,"Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare’s play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. 

My criticism was based on my belief that only a 60-year-old could carry off a performance in the same mould as Olivier's or Guinness's. Now, having watched Fearon's performance, I can see that maturity and stagecraft aren't the only things that count. What counts above all is the inner life of the character. Fearon has plenty of that. With a commanding, intelligent presence, he exudes the dignity and pride of an African general who has risen to high office in a racist white society.

He also has the physical strength and authority needed to make it clear to us how threatening he is to the Venetian oligarchs. They are alarmed that a black man should be entrusted with command of a ship and, ultimately, the city. The fact that the audience finds him so attractive only adds to their alarm. And yet there is something of the young man about him – he's still learning, making mistakes, and capable of falling in love.

He gives the part a powerful performance, showing us Othello’s nobility and sensitivity, and the desperation of a proud man whose life has become one long nightmare. He also shows us that, while Iago’s poison has destroyed the love between Othello and Desdemona, Othello’s love for her remains undimmed"
C2,"The Wrong Country Uncle chose for them a package holiday at a very reasonable price: a flight from Gatwick Airport twelve nights in Venice the fairyland city in the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went together to the travel agency to make the booking the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast all of them learning Italian. Keith and Dawne were not perturbed. When Keith asked about the price he expected the clerk to say it was for the cheapest place available, but instead the clerk said: We could go much cheaper but I thought you wanted to save on the costs. The Wrong Country Uncle must have given him a very generous commission. But Keith and Dawne didn’t think to ask and so they just thanked him and went off to Venice. However, as soon as they arrived they found that the Concordia was much more of a hostel than a Pensione and when they went to their room they discovered the bed linen was thin and not very clean. After they had made themselves somewhat more comfortable, with the limited means available, they went down to the dining-room and they were astonished. They were served by a waitress with an absolutely disgusting appearance. One must be rather insensitive to find her ugly. She had an enormous head a pallid complexion and a voice so low and so ugly that it was hardly possible to make out the words she uttered. Keith and Dawne were extremely distressed by the experience. Then it became even worse. One night a middle-aged woman with a very unpleasant personality joined their table. She spoke very bad English and had very little knowledge of Italian. It transpired that she was the teacher accompanying the school group. When they got back to England, Uncle found it impossible to"
C2,"Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal. But in reality such well-rehearsed cooperative efforts are exceedingly rare. As often as not, one lion does the stalking, one makes the kill, and the rest sit around and wait their turn to eat. Occasionally two lions may stalk a single animal, but even in these cases their cooperation consists more of toleration than coordination. Of the three methods of stalking used by lions, the most common is the ""creeping stalk"" in which the lion approaches its prey as slowly and subtly as possible. The lion then moves very slowly into position for a long distance shot. This technique requires a great deal of patience and skill, and is rarely accompanied by the dramatic displays of stealth and group choreography that captivate the popular imagination. The two remaining methods of stalking - the ""walking stalk"" and the ""running stalk"" - are both more straightforward than the creeping stalk, but less effective at bringing the lion and its prey into direct contact. The walking stalk, in which the lion gets close to the prey by moving across its line of sight and then taking a long shot, was probably more common in the past when lion numbers were much higher and many of the large animals that lions hunt were more plentiful than they are today. The running stalk is used when the lion is too close to the prey for a long shot, or the shot is too difficult to take - for example, if the"
C2,"Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. The 75-year-old, who made history by becoming the first person to fly on a commercial space flight back in 2001, is ready to foot the bill for this new mission to the red planet.

The project, called Inspiration Mars, will send the married couple on a journey in a specially-built capsule to Mars and back again, whereupon they will be the pioneers of a future Mars settlement. The ambitious plan, however, is contingent on government and private funders contributing to a sum of around $1.6 billion, reports the Daily Mail. According to reports, the couple chosen would undergo two years of intense medical and psychological screening to ensure their health and mental stability for the round-trip adventure. For those concerned about potential reproduction issues, Inspiration Mars has reportedly made allowances for an on-board lab with fertility treatments, should they be required.

Few doubt the feasibility of the space flight itself, which is said to follow a similar flight path to the one undertaken by the Viking missions of the 1970s. What could pose a greater challenge is the psychological impact on the couple involved. According to The Telegraph, NASA’s human factors engineer, Alain BerInstiteller, revealed that space agencies are “struggling to understand the nature and causes of the so-called ‘space madness’, a mysterious affliction"
C2,"Garbage in garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be. Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This is a good thing, of course; it eliminates mounds of rotting detritus, eliminates rats, stops people throwing unwanted items into nearby rivers or woods, and so on. What if we were to pay for this service directly? I do not mean some kind of tax on houses, shops or cars, but charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce: pay by weight, maybe, or by volume. This is already happening in some cities in Japan and America, and there is a move afoot in the UK, for example, to introduce such charges. The advantages are clear enough. We would soon come to regard rubbish with much greater care, for we would be paying for the privilege of its disposal. If the price is right, then we would reuse things more and recycle them more too; both are good for the environment. Even a small change in behaviour can make a big difference. If a family uses only three bags a week instead of five, that means a lot less waste. At the same time we could get the prices right. If we really want to encourage the disposal of only clean rubbish, we must make it expensive to throw away rubbish that has been wrapped in, say, glossy paper or shiny plastic. If a family does not bother with composting, then that’s a cost it will have to bear. So who would be in favour of this,"
C2,"Goat Racing I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans hordes of people food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. I could feel the heat from bodies surrounding me. It was impossible to move. The shouting and hollering were getting louder, more frenetic. Suddenly, a man on a microphone announced: Goats go! A loud cheer went up. Then a stifling quiet settled on the field. My heart pounded. I stared as hundreds of heads craned in my direction. I couldn’t see any goats. The people were watching me.

(P. 55, Easter in the Caribbean.)

From a textual viewpoint, the sentence structure in this excerpt appears somewhat chaotic. However, when analysing this in the context of the scene described, it begins to make more sense. The narrator’s attempt to get a good viewpoint, the sensory overload of the crowd and the anticipation and excitement of the race are well captured through this method of writing. The disjointedness of sentence structure mirrors the overwhelming nature of the scene.

Goat Racing II The first thing that strikes you when you walk into a goat racing venue is the noise – the screaming crowds, the honking horns, the raucous shouts of the bookies hustling punters for bets. The sound is intense and everywhere at the same time. There are people of every description, from the old granny clad in white who’s only come to watch and eat a pic"
C2,"0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. Memories are selective and, especially where a controversial or sensational event is being discussed, people can lie, embellish the truth or forget important details. For a reliable account, several testimonies may need to be compared with documentary sources. However, in the case of many historical events, especially from the 19th century and earlier, such comparisons are impossible because few documentary sources exist. If this is the case, then the historian has a choice between accepting one person’s testimony over another, and risking inaccuracy, or rejecting all oral evidence altogether and risking the loss of important information. The importance of such testimony is shown in the case of the massacre of thousands of Maoris during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s. The number of Maoris killed at the Battle of Orakau alone is uncertain, and depends on oral history and written accounts. Both sources reveal conflict and controversy, and it is in these areas that oral history can illuminate an otherwise silent past. It is also in these areas that historians need to be most careful. In the case of the Orakau massacre, for example, the number of dead varies between ten and 200, depending on whose oral evidence is being taken. Although no one can be certain of the events that took place, the evidence clearly shows that it was a bloody conflict with a large number of casualties. For the moment, histor"

For the first time in its history, the British Museum was open in the evening. The opening was being launched by the one and only Lancelot Shanks. And as if this wasn’t exciting enough in itself, Lancelot was also celebrating his 67th birthday.

As he picked up his second cup of coffee, he looked out of the window and thought about the journey he had made to get to this point. It had been a long road - but he was grateful he was still on it.'

This is the first story in the memoirs of Lancelot Shanks, a British museum curator and expert of Ancient Egypt. His journey starts in England at the onset of World War Two and moves throughout Europe following the war.

The story is filled with rich details about Lancelot's past and present. There are flashbacks to his childhood in London and to his time as a solider during the war. There are stories of his time spent working in Germany as an art expert with a company called ""B.M.C."" which sent him all around Europe to purchase artwork.

The memoir takes place in London, Paris, Florence, and Venice, among other places. Lancelot seems to have an insatiable curiosity for world events and loves sharing the stories he has collected over the years.

C2,"REMOVAL DAY With her children now grown widowed Susan faces leaving the family home. The van said Susan noticed ‘Removers of Distinction’ and indeed every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables and his team of helpers not so gentle. The grand piano was an exception but as there would be a large truck and a special team for that Susan did not need to worry. Everything else was in the truck. The family heirlooms she couldn’t bear the thought of packing, or selling so she had given them away, the mahogany dining table, the paintings, the ornaments. 

As she walked from room to room the house began to look like every other house and every other house looked very much like it. The van said Removers of Distinction. What a joke they made of it. 

She could see her kitchen one last time the kitchen where she had peeled so many potatoes cooked so many stews had so many arguments and laughter it was over now. The oven went. 

‘Did I give you a list of what I wanted? she asked Fred.

‘Yes Mam I got it,’ he replied, his face showing an unnatural amount of white teeth.

C2,"Screen Learning A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. ‘I’m a little dinosaur’ he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs.

The Screen Time question is; How has the media affected the way your child sees the world? I think television has had a huge impact on our children’s perception of the world. They are exposed to information from very early on – and the way they absorb this can shape their view of reality. I have two children, aged eight and six, and their world view is increasingly becoming moulded by TV programmes, commercials and videos.

I think that the biggest influence on my children’s knowledge of the world has been television – especially the Discovery channel. They love watching it and have learnt so much about nature, animals and how everything works. For example, I can’t walk through a forest without my son pointing out various plants and telling me all about them. They are aware of the environment because they have seen shows such as ‘Blue Planet’ and ‘Planet Earth.’

However, there are some downsides to their TV education. My son’s imitation of the dinosaur and his view of the world is directly linked to what he sees on TV. For example, he thinks everything on TV is real and believes he could go and find a dinosaur in the bush or an alligator in the toilet. This is not good as it may cause fear and paranoia if they don’t differentiate between fiction and reality.

Another concern is that they are developing a negative world view"
C2,"Build it yourself at the UK’s first bamboo bike workshop A course at the Bamboo Bike Club run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan buys you a computer-designed custom frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. Read more about the new course at www.bamboobikeclub.com

To the untrained eye it would be difficult to tell the difference between a bamboo frame and its conventional steel counterpart. The bicycle, after all, is made of two wheels, a chain, a brake system, a frame, and a handlebar. Yet, beneath the surface of this unassuming machine is a story of history, innovation and sustainability.

It’s a story that begins over 5,000 years ago in Asia, where bamboo first appeared as a means of transport. In 1892 it was also used by British inventor and engineer John Henry Holmes in the construction of his quadricycle, a vehicle powered by a lawnmower engine. But it wasn’t until recent years that bamboo started to show up in bikes themselves.

The first bamboo bike appeared in the early 1990s in the Netherlands. It was hand-built and had an unmistakable, natural beauty. It was a perfect example of a design solution; a sustainable material that was also lightweight, robust, and attractive. In this sense, the bike was a symbol of the future.

In recent years the idea of building a bamboo bike has become a trend. The process is laborious, and requires some woodworking skills. To construct a bike you have to cut the bamb"
C2,"Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. The dominant male took charge. He leapt down from the highest branches of a nearby tree and began to make threatening displays. His hair was standing on end, his eyes wide open, and he screamed and shouted with his head thrown back and his hands on his hips.

Seyfarth and Cheney report that the stranger did not stand a chance. This alpha vervet male ‘…bared his teeth, clenched them, and produced a high-pitched scream. He charged forward, and hit the intruder three times on the rump, then ran a few meters away and turned to look back as if to say, “I’ll be waiting…”’ The message was unmistakable. “Welcome to the group. We will make sure you behave according to our rules, and if you don’t you’ll be out of here like a shot.” This was, of ‘…a classic case of a challenge ritual.’ 

The alpha male is the undisputed ruler of the vervet group. In such groups, like in many groups of animals in the wild, a hierarchy exists. An order. In many of these hierarchies there are individuals higher up, and those lower down. The higher the individual, the more power they have, the lower the individual, the less power they have. The individuals in the hierarchy maintain the system of power and order through various forms of interaction. Ape and"
C2,"AESTHETICS By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. They are not ideas or images. They are perceptible and therefore palpable. They are physical objects, and for that matter physical objects that were once made by human beings, which is a characteristic they do not share with the ideas or the images. It is this perceptible and palpable quality which makes it so difficult for a man to be at all certain about the work in the sense that one is usually certain about one's thoughts, feelings, or ideas.

Aesthetic theory has thus encountered a very odd problem that is not encountered in other fields. On the one hand, a piece of music, for example, as a piece of music is a product which has both been made by a man and exists objectively, but on the other hand it has an existence which, by virtue of being a product, tends to disappear and vanish into the air; and it does this just as it tends to make us aware, or should make us aware, of the fact that all the while we were listening to it, it was objectively there in front of us. It is precisely this fact that can so easily confound a listener's attitude toward the piece of music as a product, a fact to which many a composition has succumbed, for example the symphony, as a work of art and as a product at the same time. The only thing that is certain about it from the moment it begins, is that it will end."
C2,"Sand Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face gets in your sandwiches and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. In other words it behaves in pretty much the same way as children when there is a beach ball around. On the other hand it is good for a few simple sand games: building a sandman which can be kicked to death, creating a sand castle which can be swamped to destruction and inventing a sand game which will last only a few minutes before the waves come in and wash everything away. And yet the beach with its sand is one of the worlds great meeting places where people come to share a few hours of leisure in a unique environment and one of the reasons I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects is that there is a direct link between it and buildings like churches and cathedrals which are also the product of human effort and human needs. Perhaps the ultimate sandcastle would be a cathedral and in the end if we know what to do with our sandcastles then we should know what to do with our lives. 1315455000

The most successful sandcastle I ever built was in the early seventies. I must have been nine or ten years old. I built it with two small boys from a village called Shalott in the Scottish Borders. The three of us would meet each day, with buckets and spades, in the car park of a run-down hotel at Dunbar, a windswept fishing town on the coast of the Firth of For"
C2,"Art on TV Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details. A lot of the problems seem to stem from trying to pack too much into a short time slot. But they don’t have to be there – if they are, perhaps the programmes could have a longer run on a specialised channel. One of the biggest problems though is presenter-led programmes. Some people might be well known for their expertise but their style of presenting leaves a lot to be desired – some of them can hardly say the word ‘art’. They are also there to be seen as well as heard which is often a mistake on television. Programmes are too often spoiled by the presenter, whereas in a book you do not get distracted by the way it has been written, just the content. But there have been a few shows on television which have got it right, notably the BBC series Art in the Making which featured artists in their studios at work.

C2,"The Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. A good portion of us have also witnessed or experienced the contempt. How could you be acting? It’s like pretending to be something you’re not. And then you go home and stop acting. You’re yourself again, aren’t you?  This disbelief at the profession and the craft is an oddity. We accept the idea that we might have to act in real life, we’re compelled to do things we don’t want to do or hide our feelings to get ahead. We play parts as children, at work or in our families. Yet somehow the idea of this being a profession seems preposterous.  We’ve been trained to accept the illusion of the story as part of entertainment, but to question the craft of the people telling that story. In some bizarre way, we’re […]

C2,"Work Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change. Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood and even among individuals who have won eminence there is often bitterness behind the fame. This is a sign that there may be a general malaise in society because there is a contradiction between the high expectations that people now have of success and the difficulty of achieving it. There is also the fact that we feel less confident when we are older about how successful we have been. This is the time to ask ourselves whether there is any way to renew the sense of success that is fundamental to our well-being. To be respected and appreciated is to have earned recognition for something one has done. It is not just the fact of being rewarded that is important - it is the ability to see that reward in a favourable light, to take pleasure in a success that is felt to be deserved. There is still considerable room for improvement in our approach to rewarding work. The way we regard success in the workplace has become less important than the fact that it has happened. Success has lost part of its fascination for us because we have become over-preoccupied with the process of achieving it. The sense of the present has been sacrificed for an obsession with the future. A better balance has to be re-established between the past and the future. This means being more aware of the reasons for our past successes. This will give us a better sense of the nature of those successes and enable us to relate them better to our current situation. There should be more opportunities for people to reflect and take time to review what they have done and achieved."
C2,"Language You and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth they will soon be exchanging words.

Language provides us with the ability to communicate the complexities of the human condition—our thoughts, feelings, desires, wishes, fears, dreams, and hopes. It allows us to share ideas and experiences with each other. Language is a powerful tool and, while the way we speak and write is of great importance, we may not realize that our nonverbal communication is just as powerful.

Language shapes the way we think, feel and act. It shapes our culture and how we interpret the world. We don’t always recognize how powerfully it influences our lives. Words and language can bring us joy and happiness, but they can also cause pain, distress and suffering.

Words have the power to persuade and manipulate, to heal and to hurt. This is the paradox of language: that it is both a source of connection and of division; that it enables us to share our thoughts and feelings yet can so easily be used to exclude others. We learn early in life the importance of language and how to use it well.

As children, we learn from our parents, teachers and friends how to speak and write correctly. We are taught the rules of grammar and punctuation, the conventions of polite conversation, and the social norms that dictate what is appropriate to say in different situations. This process of socialization helps us to navigate the complexities of human interaction and communication.

However, while language may seem like"
C2,"Kinetic Art Rejoice — the well-nigh impossible has happened: London’s austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not thankfully by some huge-budget mega-hyped multi-media extravaganza but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century.

> It is a small exhibition, a welcome counterpoint to the big noise elsewhere. But don’t be deceived by its size. This is a show with a great sense of its subject, a delightful reminder of the wonders of art in the machine age. In a way, it is a perfect fit for a gallery such as the Hayward, which often seems to be trapped in its own sense of its own importance and is sometimes not even capable of being seen for the wood for the trees.

Kinetic art, of course, has a notorious history. It has always been a slightly embarrassed secret in the gallery world, a type of art that seems to be both intriguing and embarrassing at the same time. Artists would talk privately about how it was the future, but never dared to put it on show because it seemed just a little naive. Kinetic art, they thought, was the kind of thing the public might enjoy, but which serious critics could not take seriously. It was a bit like a theme-park attraction, something that might amuse but not quite constitute a major exhibition.

Yet this was not always the case. When kinetic art first appeared on the international scene it was greeted with the kind of excitement that was often only reserved for the very biggest names in the art world. Kinetic art was about the future and seemed to be a glimpse of what an art"
C2,"Paul Simon Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked with their destinies. When the British invaded in the mid-1960s, rock music had become a vital element of mainstream culture.

The young American singer-songwriter Paul Simon, who has died aged 78, was an intrinsic part of that seismic shift, a key figure in the emergence of rock music as a medium with the power to reflect, confront and redefine American society.

Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in Queens, New York. His family were middle class and music was an important part of his upbringing. His father played the saxophone and clarinet, and encouraged Simon to play the clarinet, then the guitar. Paul’s older brother, Eddie, was a professional jazz guitarist and a key early influence. It was to Eddie that Paul entrusted the chords to his first-ever song, ‘The Girl for Me’, when he was only 13.

In 1957, while still at school, Simon and his friend Art Garfunkel formed a duo called Tom and Jerry, taking their names from the cartoon characters popular at the time. When the duo played a gig on a school cruise, they sang Simon’s song ‘Hey Schoolgirl’, the first of what would become an extraordinary output of songs written by Simon that would be recorded over the next 60 years.

C2,"POETRY RECITALS At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. However, from all past ages and all kinds of people, one thing remains certain, and it is the universal adoration of poetry. The art of verse is a universal pleasure and the pleasure that people derive from poetry is an experience which every generation has had, and will continue to have. The timelessness of poetry is such that it transcends national boundaries, social differences, and time periods. Poetry is an art of the heart. The heart of man and the heart of nature. Poetry is the soul of the earth expressed in the mind of man and the love of man expressed in words. It is the breath of nature and the breath of man. The poems of yesteryear and today have served as a voice for men and women in the face of change and in the face of time. Poetry is a source of delight to all those whose hearts beat to the rhythmic cadences of rhyme and melody. Poetry is a medium for the expression of human emotions, which is universal to all of mankind. This is why we celebrate poetry at Crestview Academy. As an institution of learning and a place of dreams, it is fitting that we pay tribute to the spirit of art in its purest form. This is why we have poetry recitals at Crestview, so that we can all participate in the celebration of verse. Poetry recitals are a time-honored tradition at Crestview, where young minds and voices are heard"
C2,"CRYING Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness. Crying in adults, however, especially men, carries a more complicated significance. For some psychologists, crying is the physical manifestation of the expression of emotion. For others it is a social behaviour, a form of communication that sends the message “I need your help”. A group of British scientists, however, have recently come up with a startlingly different theory. They have proposed that tears have evolved as a signal of weakness, helping to prevent violence. For those men who wish to avoid a punch on the nose and, perhaps, even more, who know of women’s proclivity to shed a tear when they are upset, this theory is reassuring. So, why do men cry, and what are they saying when they do? For a start, many men find it difficult to acknowledge or express a number of emotions. They are taught that doing so is not ‘manly’ and may even be perceived as a sign of weakness. In part this is due to societal expectations of masculinity, which emphasize emotional toughness and a sense of self-control. These men would appear to be contradicting societal expectations when they cry. Crying, for men as well as women, signals distress or the need for help. When men cry, they are saying, “I need someone to do something for me, I feel overwhelmed, and I don’t know how to cope with the situation. So, crying does not always indicate weakness – it may"
C2,"Blogging: Confessing to the world Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into. So I’m making a confession right now. I’ve recently acquired something new – a blog. The website where I write it. A Facebook page with a link to my blog. A Twitter account with a link to my blog. So what do I say? The same thing I say about check-ins on websites and apps: You’re not just telling the world that you have done something – you’re announcing to the world that you are a person who does that kind of thing. And that could be an invitation to people to try it, to join in. They could ask you questions, ask you to do it with them, or even try to stop you.

C2,"The Lure of the Kitchen When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted.

Unless you own a restaurant there is rarely any job security - nor much scope for creative expression. Cooking is a humble profession - yet one that can be infused with glamour. A chef is like a film star or a rock star.

The job is hard - the hours are long - the environment is tough - and it is a pressure cooker. Cooking, though, as any aficionado knows, has its rewards. The joy of turning raw produce into something tasty and beautiful. The satisfaction of creating a dish that is perfectly composed and cooked. The fun of developing a theme around a menu. And the thrill of making a great impression on your guests.

The food industry has become an ever more attractive option for people looking for career options. It is an area that now has many openings for bright motivated graduates. The reality is that there is no other business like the food industry.

Food is a basic commodity - but also one that can be very stylish and exciting. The food industry has become an exciting place to work - an industry in which you are only limited by your imagination. The food business offers all the glamour and excitement of working in the creative industry - as well as a good solid career - and the chance to work in an environment that is fun and full of adventure.

C2,"TIM RICE I was ushered into the young man’s drawing room an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class.

A glass of wine and a polite, if slightly patronising, introduction to the idea of taking photographs for his website. The young man himself was attractive, intelligent, eloquent, and I was surprised when he asked what sort of photograph I would like to take. “A portrait,” I responded. This seemed to please him greatly. I’m used to being told off when taking pictures of people I don’t know without permission.

He stood and posed for me in a way that was both deliberate and relaxed, and in our short time together his open face, intelligent gaze and engaging body language were captivating and he posed in a way that was both thoughtful and intimate, creating some very interesting pictures. We ended with a glass of wine and a discussion about his life plans which turned out to be surprisingly ambitious.

I look forward to seeing where he ends up, and if there is one place it will not be then it’s in the kitchen.

MARILYN FELSEN-WANGLING My encounter with the young man was a pleasant one and the images we produced were varied and interesting. I found him attractive and articulate, with a gentle energy and I was flattered that he wanted a photo of himself for his website, though I have to say that I prefer portraits that express a lot, more about the person that the camera has captured.

C2,"Advertising on trial If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. This led to a cutback in spending in traditional mass-media advertising. The economic downturn hit the consumer good sectors hardest and they responded by cutting their advertising budgets.

But the really bad news for the advertising industry was a much more fundamental shift in the way that advertising worked. The media revolution that occurred in the 1990s brought with it profound changes that had a much broader impact on business than anyone initially thought. The development of interactive media and the digital world opened up new possibilities for advertisers, but it also threw into doubt the very nature and effectiveness of traditional mass-media advertising.

As if this was not enough, advertisers were becoming more sophisticated in their demands of agencies, and this led to increased pressure on the industry to deliver better results. This is all against a backdrop of the recession and falling budgets that made advertising agencies fight for their lives. The early 1990s were a time of crisis and change for the advertising industry.

At the time some argued that the problems of advertising were caused mainly by recession and that once this was over, everything would return to normal. Others believed that advertising as we knew it was fundamentally flawed and that it would never be the same again.

Many people were unaware of the profound shift that had occurred in the role of advertising. It is only now as the dust has settled and some degree of normal service has been resumed that we"
C2,"How to Write Poetry Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. Yet as a poet myself, I am inclined to give it a go. There are two questions to be answered: How does one write a poem? And how should one set about doing it well? How to write a poem The simplest definition I can come up with is that poetry is the expression of the individual thought and emotion through the means of symbol, allegory and metaphor; rather than in the plain literal terms of the prose. It is by virtue of these elements that poetry has a unique range of power, being able to express profound and complex emotions, ideas and experiences, more accurately than is possible in a plain and literal fashion. There are innumerable ways to approach poetry, but I think it would be useful to mention a few fundamental techniques and styles to help get you started.

Firstly, to the beginners amongst you: remember that poetry doesn't have to rhyme. Indeed, much of it doesn't, and if that is your only criterion for a work, you may find you'll miss a wealth of beauty by rejecting those works which are in the style of free verse.

Secondly, do not fear the use of imagery. To me, that is a large part of the joy of writing poetry; being able to take one, simple and commonplace element and give it an emotion, a personality, a voice. Metaphors, similes and allegory are your friends: you should employ"

C2,"The two sisters kept Lily’s driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement) before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone. She loved that car and the thrill of driving, and she was a good driver.

It is likely that as Lily’s sisters were from a higher social status and had been educated in the city, they were able to be less cautious about driving than their father, as he saw it as being a dangerous pastime. This is further supported by Lily’s sisters’ enjoyment of driving and their apparent ability to drive well.

Lily and Chen, on the other hand, lived in an agricultural community with more traditional views. This made driving less of a priority for Lily compared to her sisters, but the thrill of driving and her ability at it proved to be a powerful secret that she was able to keep hidden from Chen.

It is important to note that the car provided a valuable opportunity for Lily to get away from the confines of the strict social expectations that dominated her everyday life. In addition to this, it gave her a chance to experience freedom and pleasure through something outside of the realm of women’s domestic roles.

Furthermore, the driving metaphor can be seen as a representation of the novel’s broader themes, in particular, the idea of women’s emancipation and independence. By hiding the fact that she was able to drive from Chen, Lily was able to assert her own autonomy and self-sufficiency in a society that still regarded women’s abilities as inferior to those of men"
C2,"We are Talking Big Boots here. Really BIGTIME Boots. I stood in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money no object. I wore the whole truly cowboy outfit and if you had the outfit you might be a cowboy. This was the old west, still there somewhere around the desert.

And then came the sound of a voice so low and so deep that I almost turned around but did not. I was alone with my thoughts and with my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots, or so I thought. I could not see anyone, but then you never can hear, unless you are the hearer. I heard someone say, ""Hello"".

I thought this was a real voice. I tried to make eye contact with this unseen man, or whoever this might be, but found that I was not alone. And still, I could not see anyone.

""Who’s there?” I asked, cautiously. I have never been in a more vulnerable position, or so I thought. I didn't want any trouble. It's not every day you get to wear a 2,000-dollar outfit, which included my boots and this hat.

""Hello,"" I said again, more confidently. There was no way out but up, or so I thought. And still I couldn’t see anyone.

I had a good imagination but did not expect my wild west scenario to have this twist.

C2,Love them fear them worship them human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports There's a bump bump bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird a bird of portent augury and divination. Wrens are one of the few birds to sing in the winter and our ancestors paid them a lot of attention because of this. They saw them as portentous creatures and they associated their song with the imminence of spring. These days the wren's singing is just a sign that it is winter and that the wren is a hardy little soul not given to being deterred by cold weather. This is also the time of year when birds are at their most vulnerable. The birds are very busy right now eating in preparation for a period when food will be scarce. The fact is that birds often struggle for survival around Christmas and this is why they were venerated at this time of year. In Roman times there was a goddess called Pax a sort of goddess of peace who had doves and pigeons as her companions. When the Romans converted to Christianity the pigeons became doves which symbolise peace and purity. So we still have a dove-pigeon symbol at Christmas time. Another bird associated with Christmas is the swallow. It's a summer bird that flies south in the autumn. When it flies back in spring the swallows are said to signal the return of mild weather and the hope of a good harvest. Again like the wren the swallow's return is a reflection of its own resilience not a sign of human good or ill fortune. Although most people in the UK don't believe
C2,"Joanna’s Lessons Joanna MacGregor has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist. So why has she added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano? Even a member of that mythical species the completely tone deaf could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. But in a break from her rigorous touring schedule, the internationally renowned pianist has been writing music books for young children to learn from. MacGregor is an advocate for children’s music education and her books are now being distributed across the US, Canada and the UK. What drives her to undertake yet another ambitious and time-consuming project? Joanna’s Piano Adventures Vol 1 The first book – “Piano Adventures” – was released in November 2013 and it’s available on Amazon, in Barnes & Noble, Foyles in London and on Joanna’s website.

The second book “Piano Adventures – Encore!“ was published in September 2014. It follows on from the initial volume and provides a more advanced exploration for those children who have already made a start with their first book.

Both books have been written to give children who are learning to play the piano the kind of experience that is usually only available to those who are lucky enough to have lessons from a great teacher. “With my books, I want to offer all children the gift of playing beautiful music as early as possible,” says Joanna.

As a child, Joanna remembers trying to master the piano but struggling to understand traditional books on piano lessons that were often boring and difficult to follow. To help other young pianists, she has now drawn on her"
C2,"Every Picture Tells a Story Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer but also illuminating. Working on a script I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point. I began to think of the film as an elitist medium and of myself as an elitist.

The film as a form is inherently elitist; you have to possess a certain level of cultural knowledge or acuity to understand it as it is meant to be understood. The novelist has the space to expand on ideas; the screenwriter does not. The film is all about the image. Images need to be seen in order for the idea to be realised fully. So, the film viewer must know something; he or she must have a certain vocabulary to be able to comprehend and analyse the images.

A simple example. A character in the novel might say: “I will never be able to forgive him;” this phrase can be reduced to a single image: A character with an expression of profound disgust looking at an image of the character he or she cannot forgive. And that image speaks volumes. The image, like all images in a film, is intended to convey meaning.

This realisation can lead to a very rewarding process of reduction and clarification for the screenwriter, who has to get down to the most basic level of the story and strip it bare. If the novel has, for example, twenty pages of characterisation or back-story, the screenwriter has to ask: What do we need to know about this character in order to understand the story as it unfolds on screen?

C2,"The Heat is On We’ve all heard of global warming but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives? Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. For example, there will be changes in the frequency and intensity of storms in some areas, droughts and floods in others, and a gradual melting of polar ice caps. The climate will be changing in other ways too. More rainfall may cause rising sea levels and lead to loss of farmland and homes. Scientists predict that global warming may affect agriculture and food production. It could mean that food has to be imported from other countries which, in turn, will drive up the cost of food in our local shops. Increased humidity will make us feel hotter, and more humidity means more mosquitoes. Global warming could even be responsible for the spread of tropical diseases into countries where they have never been seen before. The warmer temperatures will also have a knock-on effect on other aspects of our lives. For example, the production of alcoholic drinks may decrease as it relies on cold temperatures for fermentation. It’s difficult to think of a situation where global warming will be welcomed with open arms. The truth is, as the earth heats up, we will all feel the effects, and it will be up to us to make changes to our lifestyle in order to make the most of a challenging future. Weather Report: Global Warming in the News The climate of the earth is changing, so say scientists. Over the last 30 years temperatures have risen steadily, and many believe that"
C2,"Maps The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth’s surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. Although the scale of a map can easily be determined, it may not be able to indicate the distance of any two places on it; e.g. the distance between place A and B is 20 km. Maps may be topographic, thematic, or topolithic.

The scale of a map may range from 1: 1 (which is a large scale map) to 1: 250,000 or even larger, which is a small scale map. The detail a map provides is determined by the scale chosen. A map is a plan or diagram that portrays an area of the earth’s surface by representing the elements of an area, in a generalized manner, with reference to scale and direction.

In a map, a particular area is shown reduced in size, which gives it a scale. It is a detailed presentation of geographical information through the use of symbols and color codes to represent different geographical features, e.g. mountains, valleys, cities, rivers, and so on.

Topographic maps are the most common type of map used by most people and depict the physical features of the earth. These are often used for navigation, especially in the wilderness. Topographic maps also use contours to indicate the height of terrain above sea level.

C2,"HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. Even without the recent centennial celebrations of Shackleton's expeditions, his fame might endure as the title character of a film called The Endurance, and as a symbol of courage, leadership and persistence. In the US, however, the name Ernest Shackleton means rather less. But he is slowly making his way into the American consciousness, helped by the bicentenary of his birth in 2006 and, more recently, a biography published by his great granddaughter, Alice, in 2003, titled Polar Obsession. But most intriguing for the business world is that Shackleton has been embraced as an example of good management. This is partly because of his extraordinary perseverance: he led two major expeditions to the Antarctic at the beginning of the 20th century, coming close to success on his third, before the Endurance was crushed in the ice in 1915. Shackleton's leadership is celebrated in the management literature as a series of well-handled crises which he dealt with calmly, without losing sight of his ultimate goal. The lessons of Shackleton, it is argued, are especially relevant to executives in the current business environment, where teamwork, collaboration and shared objectives are now at a premium. When companies such as Lehman Brothers collapse amid acrimony and backbiting, business people"
C2,"Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain. In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. The range of people able to access music has widened. It is not just the educated and wealthy who can enjoy music today. Music has become a mass phenomenon and music education has become accessible to all, for example through the national curriculum. Accessibility is a double-edged sword, though. On the one hand, it is a tremendous benefit that more people have access to the riches of the past, and that today's music is more diverse than ever. On the other hand, there is a danger that a homogenised culture might emerge and that some of the variety of musical experience might be eroded, with everyone listening to the same kind of music.

I think that the key issue is how to encourage a lifelong love for music in people of all ages and that this has to be done in an individual way. We should not expect everyone to love the same kind of music or indeed the same kind of approach to music. The challenge is to find ways in which individuals can be guided to music that will be personally rewarding and enriching. For children and young people, this should mean providing a range of opportunities for them to engage in music - opportunities that allow them to try out different genres and styles.

For adults, it means providing ways in which they can continue to explore and develop their musical experience, whether this is by listening to music, learning to play instruments, or even creating new music themselves. This is a big challenge"
C2,"Holiday reading Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are of course intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. As one of the great explorers put it, 'The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.' To read and to travel may be the two greatest joys in life because they allow us to become others and experience new worlds. While you holiday away, we hope you will find a few of these great books to take with you.

A Summer Adventure

A Summer Adventure is about a family holiday and an exciting time for a boy who has just turned nine. His father has been chosen by the headmaster to be part of an expedition along the River Thames, which will take several weeks. The boy, meanwhile, gets a chance to travel along the river with his mother and three-year-old sister.

Father goes out in the early hours of the day and comes back in the evenings, sharing his adventures with the family around a fire or when they are camping, while the mother and children spend their time having adventures of their own, like swimming in the river, seeing many different animals and birds, exploring ancient castles and old houses, walking along the cliffs of Kent, and exploring the countryside.

All this has the effect of making the boy's parents proud of their children and of themselves as parents. As one of them says, 'When I think of all that we have seen and done...I am sure we shall never forget our lovely river journey. It is something"
C2,"Photography When a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills personal views and experience together with a set of social and cultural norms. The photographer then edits this information to create a finished photograph that is communicative and expressive and that has a significant social and cultural impact. Photographers use a camera.

The first cameras were invented in China, they were wood and bamboo vessels used from the 5th century BC. In ancient Greece, camera obscura, the precursor of the photographic camera, was employed as a mechanical device for producing pictures. In 1826, Joseph Nicéphore Niépce made the first recorded photograph on a pewter plate. In 1827, the first camera with a lens, the diorama, was invented by Louis Daguerre. In 1839, the first photograph was made by George Eastman, with the invention of roll film. By the 1900s, cameras were miniaturized and cheap to produce.

The digital camera came about with the digital revolution and is now the most popular type of camera. The digital camera replaces the photographic film in the analog camera with digital capture by a CCD sensor. Photographers use different types of cameras and lenses to capture different types of images depending on their intention. Some photographers, for instance, focus on artistic photography or photojournalism, or they may focus on a subject, like landscape photography.

The main techniques of photography include lighting, depth of field, composition, and framing"
C2,"Family Business ‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father with my brother Maurice in tow had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls’ school I attended. I was tired and happy to be leaving. The school had been too academic; far too cerebral, I had felt. I preferred practical things, the sort of work Mum did. She designed houses. So as the conversation in the car continued, I shared my thoughts with them. The topic turned to what Mum did and Dad asked me what building meant to me. I said that I thought buildings were like clothes, they covered your body, or in this case, your land and made it safe and pleasant. Dad and Maurice agreed and we moved on. A few weeks later Dad told us that he’d bought a derelict house and we would be renovating it. Mum could design it and we, all of us could help fix it up. We were so excited! We’d become a family team, just like Mum and Dad, who ran their own business, designing clothes for a living.

A Family Business, Just like Theirs

We were thrilled at the prospect of rebuilding a house. We loved the idea of being together, and working together like Mum and Dad did. Our family was not typical. Many families didn’t work together as a team in their businesses, but we did. We shared the same values and goals. We respected each other’s skills and abilities, and supported each other’s dreams. My Dad, Maurice, and I were not only family, we were also co-workers and friends. We believed"
C2,"Vancouver In the last ten years or so hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver in western Canada. To relax in the evening residents stroll down the city streets and if you join them you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. English speaking people can also feel like strangers in a foreign country because in recent years people who speak English as their first language have become a minority in the city. A similar situation can be found in New York City where a large number of people speak Chinese, Korean or Spanish at home, so when you visit the city, you don’t just find yourself hearing another language – it’s like walking around in a different country!

Both of these cities and many others around the world have large numbers of people who are not just foreigners, but foreigners who are here to stay. The city of New York has seen a 10% increase in its population since 2000 which has been helped a lot by the arrival of immigrants. Vancouver and New York are similar to other cities in the world where immigrants are arriving in large numbers to find work and a better life, and to make a contribution to their new cities. However, their arrival can also lead to problems like overcrowded schools and hospitals, and these problems need to be addressed so that the cities can continue to grow in the right way.

In Vancouver, the increase in population has been caused by a number of different things. Firstly, the city is close to a beautiful natural environment and many people from Asia and other parts of the world are attracted to it as a place to live. Secondly, there are many jobs available and the city’s excellent infrastructure helps to attract people"
C2,"MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house I learned that opera is in fact only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That’s as it should be of course. Now when I think of opera as a sort of theatre, it’s as a visual art form. In opera, music comes first, then comes the voice, then the story. The voice has the job of carrying the story. It’s the voice that makes an opera. What is important is to create a story around music, so the story is driven by the music. In opera, voice is character, music is emotion and orchestra is environment. The voice, because of its special ability to express emotion through music, is also the most powerful medium of communication. It can say and do things that no other art form can do so convincingly. And it is, for this reason, the reason to watch opera. The visuals, the stage settings, the costumes, all play their part in setting up the atmosphere but they are not there for the sake of the story or the character. They are there to enhance the music – music that is about to be infused with emotion and character through the singer. Opera as theatre is therefore only part of the experience. Music and character will get you 80% of the way there. The other 20% comes from what you see. Now all this has led me to an interesting conclusion. My conclusion is that music and the stage, in opera, are not mutually exclusive. They are one and the same. It’s the music that makes the story. The stage settings and the characters on stage"
C2,"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology 'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. The early television and radio pioneers were inspired by this idea of spreading the word.

It all started with Marconi in the late 19th century. He wanted to make people talk across the oceans. This was to be a miracle in technology and a means of peace. At that time there were no broadcasts - Marconi was sending telegrams. But in 1906 David Sarnoff - a young man from the Yiddish ghetto on the Lower East Side in New York - decided that radio should be a universal means of communication.

The first radio broadcasters were radio amateurs. They were inventors, engineers and experimenters who spent much of their time on the air, talking about the weather and local news. In the early 1920s, some of these broadcasters began to make more professional use of the medium. They started to use the new invention, the microphone and the new discovery, the commercial advertisement.

The early American broadcasting pioneers - Patterson, Ducrow, and Nye - were people of vision. They saw the potential of radio as an instrument for good and a means of mass communication. They helped spread the word of the industrial revolution across the prairies.

The first European broadcasters were English radio amateurs like Balfour Smith and Sir George Biddell Airy. At first, they"
C2,"Writing Reviews Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner’s point of view. Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. They are read by the author, or his friends, who immediately respond; by people of the author’s profession who may react at once to some of the judgments, some of the time. Their impact on the writer, if they have one, is invariably transient. Of course this does not mean that the reviews are of no value to anybody.

It goes without saying that there is very little money in writing reviews, especially on the scale with which this particular subject is likely to be discussed here, which is the scale at which I usually write them. Writing is, as it were, a labour of love. It is also an occasional solicitation of loathe, but love predominates. And since it is a labour of love one wants the thing to be good, or at least not bad, though how can it be bad if the reviewer has to accept the book before he looks at it? He must not be a critical consumer, a consumer who selects the book on general principles and then offers his considered opinion of it: he is, rather, what some critics call a professional reader, someone who has to find something in the book which he can, in some way, talk about—not necessarily praise, or condemn, but talk about.

If the book under review is an obscure or difficult one, the reviewer is entitled to feel that he has, in some sense, earned his reward—that he is"
C2,"Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941 despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst its alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. But from the start, it was acclaimed as a cinematic masterpiece.

Citizen Kane was the final result of a screenplay workshop conducted by Orson Welles under the auspices of RKO, where he was employed, along with Herman J. Mankiewicz. The film was shot in a few weeks, on a relatively meager budget. It was also the first feature film Welles both starred in and directed, and though he did not write the script, he helped shape it.

The film’s non-linear narrative unfolds in flashbacks, employing a large ensemble cast of characters that help tell the story of the newsman Charles Foster Kane and the nature of his famous last word, “Rosebud”. Citizen Kane uses the device of newsreel footage, and dramatic readings of Kane’s fictional newspaper headlines to transition between scenes, and Welles’ innovative use of visual and aural techniques in creating the narrative were both inventive and influential.

Among these was the long take, a precursor of the single-shot scene that has become such a staple of the movies. The movie is now considered a groundbreaking work of art, and was placed at number one on the American Film Institute’s lists of the 100 greatest American films in 1997 and the 100 greatest films in American cinema"
C2,"England’s breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. 

The English breakfast emerged in the 18th century with a newfound appetite for ‘eating’ and it became popular to offer a generous breakfast to visitors or guests which often included eggs, bacon, grilled kidneys, sausages, mushrooms, toast and marmalade. However, despite the wide range of food available, in many instances it was more of a statement of social status and wealth, rather than a hearty meal designed to fuel the day ahead.

Therefore, it was the Victorian period that saw the most rapid growth of the breakfast as we now know it. The expansion of the railway and the booming economy meant that there was a huge demand for hotels and restaurants that could offer an enticing breakfast menu, and this led to the advent of the all-day breakfast menu. One of the more famous examples is The Breakfast Club in London, which has now inspired numerous imitations around the world.

However, it is not just hotels and restaurants that have benefited from the English breakfast, as the British breakfast has also influenced other countries around the world. As the United Kingdom expanded its empire during the 19th century, they took their breakfast habits with them, and countries such as India, Australia, and Canada now have their own version of the English breakfast. The English breakfast is a symbol of home and comfort, with its familiar ingredients and tastes, and its enduring popularity means that it will continue"
