A2,"Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings like museums to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. The engineers make sure the building can stand up and the carpenters build the walls and floors. The electricians put in the lights and plumbers fix the pipes. 1000s of years ago, people built mud huts. They were easy to make and kept people dry and warm. But they were not very strong and could not stand up to bad weather. In the 1800s, people started to build houses with bricks. These houses were stronger and could keep out the cold and rain. But they were hard to make and took a long time to build. In the 1900s, people invented concrete. Concrete is a special mixture of sand, water, and cement. It is much easier to make than bricks and can be molded into any shape. This made it possible to build tall buildings that could reach up to the sky. 1000s of years ago, people built mud huts.

After we go the people here in Dante's Peak will stay. They have their shops and their businesses. You think only about volcanoes but this is about money too.' 'OK' Harry said with a smile. 'I understand. I'll go with you. But only if you promise to take me to the bar after we're done.' 'Deal' said Paul grinning back. 'Now let's go save some lives.'

Harry and Paul walked into the town of Dante's Peak, surrounded by a sea of flattened buildings and debris. They walked past the remains of a grocery store, its shelves bare and its windows shattered. They walked past a restaurant, its tables and chairs twisted and tangled. They walked past a school, its walls cracked and its doors hanging off their hinges.

As they walked, Harry couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. He had seen this kind of destruction before, but it never got any easier. He had lost friends and family in volcanic eruptions, and he knew that the people of Dante's Peak were in just as much danger.

Paul seemed to sense Harry's unease, and he put a hand on his shoulder. 'Don't worry, Harry,' he said. 'We're going to get these people out of here before it's too late.'

Harry nodded, trying to push aside his fear. He knew that he had to be strong for Paul and for the people of Dante's Peak. He took"
A2,"Careful! Fight with your head don't fight with your heart boy!' shouted Bowen. The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter. But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code. Sir Bowen and all the kings princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. But there were no knights in the world today. Sir Bowen was the last. 

Sir Bowen's horse whinnied and tossed its head. Sir Bowen patted its neck. The knight looked at Einon. ""You are not a peasant, boy. You are a prince. The king needs you. But you must learn the Old Code. You must learn how to fight with your head, not your heart."" Sir Bowen raised his voice. ""Fight with your head, boy! Not with your heart!"" Einon gritted his teeth. He was angry and hurt. He did not want to fight with his head. He wanted to fight with his heart. 

""I will fight with my heart!"" Einon shouted back. ""I will avenge my father's death!"" Sir Bowen sighed. ""Very well, boy. If that is how you want it. But know this: you will not defeat the dragon with your heart alone."" Einon glared at the knight. He did not understand why the knight was trying to teach him how to fight with his head instead of his heart. But he was determined to prove the knight wrong. He would avenge his father's death, no matter what. 

Sir Bowen looked at Einon. He could see the determination in the young prince's eyes. He"
A2,"The History of Farming Before people started farming they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. They planted wheat, barley and oats. They also raised sheep, goats and cows. They did not have plows or other machines to help them farm so they used sticks and stones to prepare the ground.  At first farming was done in small areas and people still had to hunt for food. But as time went on farming became more important and people began to grow more food.  People also started to trade food with other groups of people. This meant that people did not have to move around as much to find food.  Over time farming spread to other parts of the world. People in China began to farm around 7000 years ago and people in Europe started farming around 6000 years ago.  In the Americas farming began around 5000 years ago.  Today farming is very important. There are many different types of farming including:  -Crop farming which grows crops like wheat, corn and soybeans.  -Livestock farming which raises animals like cows, pigs and chickens.  -Organic farming which uses special methods to grow crops without using chemicals.  -Hydroponic farming which grows crops in water rather than soil.  - Aquaculture which raises fish and other seafood in ponds or tanks.  -Veget"
A2,"ICE-FISHING If you drive north from Toronto for three hours you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter the lake becomes ice and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. This is ice-fishing.

The men who go ice-fishing are not rich. They are usually farmers or factory workers who live in small towns around the lake. They work hard all week and then spend their weekends on the ice, trying to catch enough fish to feed their families.

The lake is frozen over with a thick layer of ice, smooth as glass. The fishermen drill a hole in the ice and then lower a line with a hook and bait down into the water. They wait for hours, sitting on the ice, watching the line and hoping that a fish will bite.

The fishermen are patient and quiet. They don't talk much. They just sit and wait. Sometimes they drink coffee or tea to keep warm. Sometimes they tell stories of the fish they caught last week or the big storm that came through.

It is a peaceful and beautiful sight to see the men on the ice, sitting in their little houses, waiting for the fish to bite. It is a way of life that is simple and honest, a way of connecting with nature and the earth. And at the end of the day, when the sun sets and the men pack up their gear, they come back to their families with a bag of fish and a story to tell.

Ice-fishing is a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation in Canada. It is"
A2,"A man heard me and looked round. Then this big man saw me in the corn. He walked to me and I began to shout loudly: ' His foot is going to kill me ! ' The man stopped. For a minute he looked down at me carefully. (We look at a small animal in the same way and think: 'Will it hurt me?') Then he spoke in a deep voice: 'It is not going to kill you. It is only a foot.' I was surprised that he spoke so calmly. 'What are you doing here?' he asked. 'I am hiding from him.' 'From whom?' he asked. 'From the big man.' 'Why are you hiding?' 'Because he is going to kill me.' 'He is not going to kill you.' 'Oh, yes he is!' I shouted. 'He will kill me if he finds me!' 'No, he will not.' 'Yes, he will!' 'I promise you that he will not.' 'You don't know him!' I shouted. 'I do know him,' he said. 'I know him very well.' 'Then why doesn't he kill you?' 'Because I am his friend.' 'His friend?' 'Yes, his best friend.' 'But why doesn't he kill you?' 'Because he is kind.' 'Kind?' 'Yes, very kind.' 'Then why doesn't he kill me?' 'Because he is not going to kill you.' 'Oh, thank you!' I shouted. 'Thank you so much!' 'You are welcome,' he said. 'Now you had better come out from there.' 'But he will kill me!' 'No, he won't.' 'Yes, he will!' 'I promise you that he won'"

A2,"Big cats There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot! They are also very good at hiding so they can sneak up on their prey.  Lion's are the second biggest cats. They are called the kings of the jungle because they are very strong and have a loud roar. They live in groups with their families. They are very good at hunting and they have very sharp claws.  Leopards are the next biggest cats. They have spots on their fur and they are very good at climbing trees. They are also very good at hiding and they can run very fast.  Cheetahs are the fastest cats. They can run up to 100km an hour. They are also very good at hunting. They have a special way of running called a ""double suspension gallop"".

A2,"Marco stood at the door of Silvia's flat and watched Gabriel leaving. He looked carefully at his clothes and his shoes. Why didn't Silvia open the door? She was in there. Then suddenly it opened. 'Silvia dear' Marco said 'you look wonderful ...' He stopped. Silvia didn't look wonderful. Her face was red and she looked unhappy.

'Marco, what are you doing here?' she asked.

'I was just passing and I saw you were home, so I thought I would come up and say hello,' Marco replied.

Silvia looked at him suspiciously. 'Why did you come here?' she asked again.

Marco hesitated. 'I just wanted to see you, that's all,' he said.

Silvia crossed her arms and leaned against the door. 'I don't want to see you, Marco. You know that.'

Marco felt a pang of disappointment. 'Oh, Silvia, why not? I'm sorry if I've done something wrong. I just wanted to talk to you and catch up.'

Silvia sighed and rubbed her temples. 'It's not that, Marco. It's just...I don't want to be around you right now. Can you understand that?'

Marco nodded slowly. 'Yes, I understand. I'm sorry.' He turned to leave, but Silvia stopped him with a hand on his arm.

A2,"'I am quite well' I always answered. Why did I say that? Why did I not ask for his help? Perhaps because in one sense it was true. I was not in pain. 'It cannot be the mysterious illness from the village' I thought. 'My illness is now three weeks old. It is something else.'

""I am quite well,"" I said, and smiled at him. ""But I have been feeling a little unwell of late.""

""Ah, I see,"" he said, his eyes narrowing with concern. ""You must come and rest at my place. You cannot be expected to carry on like this.""

""Thank you,"" I said, feeling a surge of gratitude towards him. ""But I don't want to be a burden. I will try to rest more.""

""Nonsense,"" he said, waving his hand dismissively. ""You are not a burden. You are my friend, and I will not have you suffering in silence.""

I felt a warmth spread through my chest at his words, and I knew that I could trust him. ""Thank you,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""I will come to your place tomorrow.""

""Excellent,"" he said, smiling at me. ""I will expect you.""

And with that, our conversation came to an end. But I knew that it was only the beginning of a new chapter in our friendship, one that would be marked by mutual trust and understanding.

A2,Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good in the water and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair and this keeps them warm in the water. They have sharp teeth and strong claws. Otters eat mostly fish. Sometimes they eat shellfish too. There are only two species of otters: the European otter and the sea otter. Sea otters live in the Pacific Ocean. They are much bigger than European otters. They can grow up to 2.5 meters long and weigh as much as 30 kilograms. Sea otters are also very fat. This helps them stay warm in the cold ocean water. They eat mostly sea urchins and mussels. They also eat fish and other small animals. Sea otters are very good at swimming and can hold their breath for up to 8 minutes. They are also very social animals. They like to play and swim together. Sea otters are also very smart. They can use rocks to open shells and they can even use sticks to pick up food. Sea otters are also very important to their ecosystem. They help keep the number of sea urchins down. This helps keep the kelp forests healthy. Kelp forests are important for many other animals to live in. Sea otters are also very important to people. They are a popular tourist attraction. Many people want to see them in their natural habitat. Sea otters are also important for the fishing industry. They help keep the number of fish down. This means that there are more fish for people to catch

A2,"The history of horse racing From the first history books ever written it is clear that horse racing has always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. The sport developed in England during the 17th and 18th centuries and it has continued to grow and change since then. 

The origins of horse racing can be traced back to Central Asia, where archaeological evidence suggests that horse racing was being held as early as 4500 years ago. The first written records of horse racing come from ancient Mesopotamia, where the sport was mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh, a poem written around 2000 BCE. From there, horse racing spread throughout the ancient world, with the Greeks and Romans being particularly fond of the sport.

In Greece, horse racing was held as part of religious festivals, with the winner of the race being awarded a wreath of olive branches. The Romans, on the other hand, saw horse racing as a form of entertainment for the masses, and they built large stadiums to host the races.

As the Roman Empire declined, horse racing continued to be popular in Europe, particularly in England. In the 12th century, Arab horses were brought to Europe, which had a significant impact on the sport of horse racing. These Arab horses were faster and more agile than the horses that were previously used for racing, and they helped to revolutionize the sport.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, horse racing became a"

'I will not move from this spot until I have seen the lion,' he added. 'But sir,' said the driver, 'the lion is not for you, it's for the king.' 'I don't care who it's for,' said Don Quixote, 'I must see it.'""

The driver hesitated, but Don Quixote was insistent, so he eventually agreed to open the box. Inside, to Don Quixote's great disappointment, was a large and very lifelike stuffed lion. Don Quixote was furious and accused the driver of trying to trick him. The driver explained that he had been given strict instructions not to reveal the true nature of the box to anyone, but Don Quixote would not be placated. He declared that the stuffed lion was a magical creature and that he must have it as his own. The driver reluctantly handed the lion over to Don Quixote, who proudly displayed it to his squire, Sancho Panza. Sancho was equally disappointed and tried to reason with his master, but Don Quixote was determined to keep the lion as his own. As the story goes, Don Quixote's obsession with the stuffed lion continued for some time,"

A2,"Kong went back to Ann and took her down from the high rock. For the first time in this jungle she felt strangely safe. He jumped across a ravine and then across a river. She was a small plaything between his large fingers. Then he stopped and put her down.

""You are a strange creature, Ann,"" he said. ""You are not like any other animal in this jungle. You are not afraid of me. You are not afraid of anything. I think you are a very special animal, Ann.""

Ann looked up at him with her round, brown eyes. She was not afraid of him. She was not afraid of anything. She was a very special animal, indeed.

Kong picked up Ann again and held her close. He could feel her heart beating fast in her chest. He could feel her warm breath on his hand. He could feel her tiny fingers curled around his thumb.

""You are a very special animal, Ann,"" he said again. ""I think I will keep you as my own special pet.""

And with that, Kong took Ann back to his lair deep in the jungle. He kept her there, caged and safe, and he loved her very much.

The end. 🐒💕

He waited for other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. The next morning Serrano looked around the island that saved his life. He saw fresh water, food, and shelter. He also saw a message in the sand. It was a message from a woman named Maria.

The message read: ""Welcome Pedro, you are safe here. I am Maria, a princess from the kingdom of the sea. You are the first human to ever make it to our shores. We have been watching you from afar and are impressed with your bravery. You are free to stay here as long as you like. But be warned, our kingdom is not for the faint of heart.

'Perhaps the new king will come to the fight' thought the Archbishop. Sir Ector went to the fight with his two sons Sir Kay and young Arthur. The king was killed and Sir Ector's sons were injured. Only young Arthur was left to challenge the winner of the fight. He was very brave and defeated the winner. He was crowned the new king and everyone was happy.

The passage is describing a medieval jousting tournament, where knights on horseback fight with swords. The Archbishop is hoping that the new king will attend the tournament and prove his worth by winning the fight. Sir Ector and his two sons, Sir Kay and young Arthur, are also present at the tournament. During the fight, the king is killed and Sir Ector's sons are injured, leaving only young Arthur to challenge the winner. Despite his youth and inexperience, Arthur proves to be very brave and defeats the winner, earning himself the crown of the new king.

The passage uses descriptive language to create a vivid image of the tournament, including the use of sensory details such as the sound of the swords clashing and the smell of the horses. The author also uses figurative language, such as the phrase ""the strongest and best knight always won,"" to emphasize the importance of bravery and skill in the tournament.

Frazer and Peter are very excited about their game and they've been working on it non-stop. They've been testing it on each other and making changes and improvements every week.

Clayton looked at us, his eyes wide and scared. 'I-I don't know what you're talking about,' he stammered. 'There was no ghost in my room! I must have been dreaming or something.'

Clayton shook his head, his eyes darting back and forth between us. 'I'm telling you, there was no ghost! You must have imagined it!'

A2,"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today there are policemen everywhere but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were a lot of crimes, like pickpockets and thieves. The government decided to create a special police force to help keep London safe. The London Police Force was created in 1829 and it was the first police force in the world. The police officers were called 'bobbies' and they wore blue uniforms with a helmet and a white stripe down their trousers. They patrolled the streets of London on bicycles and horses. They had to deal with many problems, such as drunkenness, prostitution and violence. They also had to deal with the poor and the homeless. The London Police Force was very successful and soon other cities in England started to create their own police forces. Today, there are police forces all over the world, and they are very important for keeping people safe.

A2,"Parrots Perhaps you have seen these beautiful birds with their lovely colours and long tails in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil Australia and India. They usually live in large groups and because they like to eat fruit they are sometimes a problem for farmers.
Parrots are known for their intelligence and ability to mimic sounds. They have a special organ in their throat called a syrinx which allows them to make a wide range of sounds. Some parrots can even learn to talk and repeat words and phrases.
Parrots are very social birds and they communicate with each other using a variety of calls and chirps. They are also very playful and enjoy flying and playing with toys. Some parrots can even be trained to do tricks and perform tasks for their owners.
Parrots are popular pets because of their intelligence and playful nature. They are relatively low maintenance pets compared to dogs and cats and can be kept in a cage or aviary. However it is important to provide a parrot with a varied and nutritious diet and plenty of exercise and social interaction.
Parrots are also important to their ecosystems. They help to pollinate plants and disperse seeds and can even act as seed predators in some cases. Some species of parrots are also important indicators of the health of their ecosystems.
In conclusion parrots are fascinating creatures with their bright colours playful nature and intelligence. They are popular pets and play important roles in their ecosystems. By learning more about these birds we can appreciate their beauty and importance and take steps"

In order to make the story more engaging, you could consider adding these elements. For example, you could describe the characters' emotions and thoughts as they go about their day, or you could add a conflict or challenge that they must overcome.

Here is an example of how you could revise the text to add more plot and character development:

John woke up early and went to the lake. He wanted to catch some fish for breakfast. He put on his waders and his fishing rod and headed out. He walked along the shore, feeling the cool water splash against his legs. He cast his line and waited patiently for a bite.

As he sat there, he thought about how much he loved fishing. It was a peaceful way to spend the morning, just him and the water. He felt grateful for this time alone, away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

Suddenly, he felt a tug on his line. He pulled hard, and a big fish jumped out of the water. John was thrilled and quickly pulled it in. He gave some fish to Peter, his best friend, who was sitting on the shore reading a book. Peter was happy to eat the fish and thanked John for"
A2,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop age 14 Last summer I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. We were excited to see the elephants and waited eagerly for the show to begin. As soon as the elephants came into the square, we were amazed by their size. They were huge and had a gentle look in their eyes. The show started with the elephants walking around the square, spinning in circles, and even playing football! We laughed and clapped at every trick they did. The highlight of the show was when the elephants danced to a catchy tune. They moved their trunks in time with the music and even waved to the audience. My family and I were having the time of our lives. We were mesmerized by the elephants' intelligence and grace. After the show, we got to feed and pet the elephants. They were so gentle and kind, and we felt lucky to have seen them perform. The elephant show was an unforgettable experience, and we left the park with big smiles on our faces. I'm so glad we got to see these magnificent creatures up close and personal. I hope to see them again someday.

The sailors looked at each other, then back at Englehorn. ""A little less than half, sir,"" one of them said. ""But it's been getting lower by the minute,"" another added.

Englehorn nodded, his face grim. ""We can't afford to lose any more water. It could capsize us."" He looked at Hayes. ""We're going to have to ride this out.""

Hayes' eyes were wide with fear. ""But what if the ship sinks? What then?""

B1,"THE ICEHOTEL For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. A unique hotel should be built in the Swedish town of Jukkasjärvi, near the Norway border, to showcase the beauty of ice and snow. And so the ICEHOTEL was born. The first ICEHOTEL was built in 1989 and since then the hotel has been rebuilt every winter using ice and snow from the nearby Torne River. The hotel consists of a series of ice blocks with different shapes and sizes, held together by a system of ice and steel. Each room is individually designed and decorated, with the help of local artists and craftsmen. The ICEHOTEL has become a popular destination for people who want to experience something truly unique. It has also become a symbol of innovation and creativity in the world of hospitality. The hotel offers a range of activities and experiences, including ice sculpture classes, snowmobile tours, and Northern Lights viewing. The ICEHOTEL also has a number of restaurants and bars, serving local and international cuisine. The hotel is open from mid-November to mid-April, depending on the weather conditions.

B1,"Grass Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are over 9000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. Grass is also used for many human purposes including food, fuel, and building materials.  Grasses are low-growing plants with long, narrow leaves that are usually green in color. They are often confused with other low-growing plants like sedges and rushes, but they are easily distinguished by their slender, hollow stems and flat, blade-like leaves. Grasses are usually found growing in dense clumps or tufts, and they can reach heights of up to 6 feet or more.  Grasses are an important part of many ecosystems. They provide food and shelter for a wide range of animals, from tiny insects to huge herbivores like deer and bison. They also help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion, and they can even act as nurseries for young fish and other aquatic animals.  Grasses are also an important source of food for humans. Many types of grasses are grown as crops, including wheat, oats, barley, and rice. These crops are used to make bread, pasta, and other food products.

Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies but the best way to see them is to travel by train.

The air grows cooler as you climb higher and the peaks become taller and more rugged. In the distance you can see snow-capped mountains and glaciers. The train stops at many places along the way so you can get out and explore. You can visit the towns of Banff and Lake Louise in the Canadian Rockies or Estes Park in the USA. You can also visit the famous hot springs of Radium and the Mesa Verde National Park. The Rockies are full of surprises and you will find something new and wonderful at every turn. 234

Answer: The phrase ""frozen look"" in this context means a stunned or shocked expression, as if the person's face had been ""frozen"" in place. It suggests that Mrs. Bantry observed Marina Gregg's face to be completely still and unresponsive, as if she had been surprised or frightened by something. This could be an indication that Marina Gregg had seen or heard something significant just before she was murdered.

In the context of the passage, the phrase ""frozen look"" is used to convey the idea that Mrs. Bantry saw Marina Gregg's face as being expressionless or unemotional, as if she had been ""frozen"" in a state of shock or surprise. This observation by Mrs. Bantry could potentially be an important clue in the investigation of the murder.

The use of the word ""frozen"" in this context is significant because it creates an image of something that is rigid and unchanging, which is the opposite of what one would expect to see in a person's face. This contrast between the expected and actual appearance of Marina Gregg's face serves to emphasize the unusual nature of her expression and to convey the idea"

B1,"Winter Driving Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow waiting to send you off the road. Wind can be blowing so hard that it's hard to hold the steering wheel steady. It's a time of year when it's easy to feel like you're taking your life into your hands every time you get behind the wheel.
I've always found that the best way to deal with winter driving is to be prepared for anything. It's important to have a good set of tires that will grip the road no matter what the conditions are. You should also make sure that your vehicle is in good working order so that you can handle whatever the road throws at you. It's also a good idea to drive defensively, taking extra time to look out for other drivers and to anticipate any potential hazards on the road.
But even with all of these precautions, accidents can still happen. It's a time of year when it's easy to feel like you're taking your life into your hands every time you get behind the wheel.
Winter driving is a challenge that requires extra care and attention. It's important to be aware of the potential dangers on the road and to take steps to protect yourself and your passengers. By being prepared and driving defensively, you can help to minimize the risks of winter driving and stay safe on the roads.
I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.

B1,"LITTLE CAT LITTLE CAT WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? When Bo the cat decided to explore a furniture van she had a bigger adventure than she expected. She was discovered by the driver after he had completed a trip of over 500 kilometres. It was the end of a long day. The driver of a furniture van was tired, hungry, and ready to get home after a long day of delivering furniture across the country. He pulled up to a rest stop and parked the van, ready to take a break. That was when he heard a faint meowing sound coming from inside the van. The driver opened the side door and was shocked to see a small cat hiding inside. The cat, Bo, had managed to sneak onto the van without being noticed while the driver was driving. Bo had been on her own adventure, exploring the country from the comfort of the furniture van. She had been on the road for over 500 kilometers, and had seen sights she never could have imagined. As the driver cautiously approached the cat, Bo looked up at him with wide eyes, purring contentedly. The driver was taken aback by the tiny cat, and couldn't believe she had been on such a long journey without him noticing. Bo was eventually returned to her home, where she was greeted with a warm welcome from her family. From that day on, Bo made sure to always be careful when exploring, but she never lost her sense of adventure. She had discovered a new way to see the world, and she was grateful for the unexpected journey.

B1,"The next day Emma was pleased to see a lot of snow outside. This was a good thing because it meant she could not go to church and see Mr Elton or go to visit Harriet and none of them could meet. The snow stayed for several days after Christmas and the only visitor to Hartfield was Mr Knightley. He came on the 27th of December and he brought with him a box of oranges. Emma was delighted to see him and she thanked him for the oranges.

""I am very glad you like them,"" he said. ""I hope you will find them a pleasant addition to your Christmas festivities.""

""Thank you, sir,"" Emma replied. ""I am sure they will be greatly enjoyed by all the family.""

Mr Knightley sat for a while longer, chatting with Emma and her mother about the weather and various other matters. Then he took his leave, promising to call again soon. Emma watched him go, feeling grateful for the distraction he had provided from her thoughts of Mr Elton.

Emma's relief at Mr Knightley's visit was understandable, given her feelings for him. However, it is also important to note that she was not yet aware of his true feelings towards her, and so she may have been mistaken in her assumption that he was there solely to distract her from her thoughts of Mr Elton. It is possible that Mr Knightley had other reasons for visiting Hartfield during the Christmas season, and it will be interesting to see how their relationship develops in the coming chapters.

As for Mr Elton, his absence from Hartfield during the snowstorm was certainly a blessing in disguise for Emma, given her feelings towards him"

At my first ballet class I was nervous as I didn’t know anyone. Everyone gathered round asking me questions all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. After a few minutes of chatting I felt more at ease. We talked about our favorite ballets and dancers. One of the girls was particularly friendly and asked if I would like to dance with her at the end of the class. I was thrilled and couldn’t wait to get started. The class was amazing I learned so much in such a short time. I was surprised at how well I could pick up the steps and techniques. At the end of the class we all danced together and it was such a great feeling to be surrounded by such talented and supportive dancers. I can’t wait to return to the Kirov and continue my training. I know it will be a long and difficult journey but I am ready for the challenge.

B1,"Sharks  Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. 

Sharks come in many different sizes, from small ones that are only a few inches long, to huge ones that are over 20 feet long. The largest sharks are called whale sharks and they can weigh over 20 tons. 

Sharks are very important to the ocean ecosystems because they keep the numbers of smaller fish and sea creatures in check. This means that they are important for keeping the ocean healthy and balanced. 

However, many sharks are in danger of becoming extinct because people are hunting them for their meat, fins, and liver oil. This is very sad because sharks have been around for over 400 million years and they are an important part of the ocean’s history. 

Conclusion: 
Sharks are fascinating creatures that play a crucial role in the ocean’s ecosystem. They come in a variety of sizes and are well adapted for feeding underwater. However, many sharks are in danger of becoming extinct due to overfishing and habitat destruction. It is important for us to protect these incredible creatures and their habitats so that they can continue to thrive in the ocean for generations to come.

The use of new ideas and advanced computer programs means that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. But in recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in the art of cartoon-making. Animators are experimenting with new techniques and styles and are producing films that are enjoyed by audiences of all ages. 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of computer-generated imagery (CGI) which allowed animators to create more realistic and detailed animations. With the advent of CGI the boundaries of what could be achieved in the world of animation were pushed even further.

Margaret who lives in London prefers to take pupils at three and four although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. ""It's important to start learning the violin at a young age because it develops the muscles in your hands and fingers and helps you to develop your musical ear,"" she explains. ""Young children are also more likely to pick up the violin if they start early because they haven't yet formed any bad habits."" Margaret is a firm believer that music education should start at home and that parents should encourage their children to play an instrument from an early age. ""It's not just about learning to play the violin,"" she says ""it's about developing your child's creativity and self-expression.""  At three years old, Emily was fascinated by the sound of the violin. She would watch as her mother practiced, mesmerized by the way her mother's fingers moved across the strings. One day, her mother decided to give Emily a chance to try. She handed Emily a tiny violin and some rosin, and showed her how to hold the instrument and how to draw the bow across the strings. Emily was hesitant at first, but with her mother's encouragement, she began to play. It was a simple tune, but to Emily, it was music from heaven. She played for hours every day, entranced by the sound of the violin. As she grew older, Emily's love for the violin only grew stronger"

B1,"The History of Shoes In the past importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today but other materials such as silk plastic or cotton are also popular depending on what is in fashion. Shoes have evolved to become more comfortable and practical over the centuries with new materials and technologies being introduced to improve their durability and support. The design of shoes has also changed significantly over time with different styles and shapes emerging in different cultures and eras. In ancient Egypt sandals were worn by both men and women and were often decorated with intricate designs and jewels. In ancient Greece sandals were worn for both practical and fashionable purposes and were often decorated with gold and silver. In medieval Europe peasants wore simple wooden clogs while knights wore elaborate spurs and armor. In the 18th century men wore buckles on their shoes as a status symbol while women wore elaborate heeled shoes with laces and bows. In the 20th century athletic shoes were invented for sporting events and sneakers became popular for casual wear. Today there are many different styles of shoes available for both men and women including boots sneakers dress shoes and sandals. Shoes have also become more technologically advanced with features such as air cushioning waterproofing and temperature control being added to improve comfort and performance. Overall the history of shoes reflects changing societal values and technological advancements and continues to evolve today.

B1,"The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the ‘famous Ghan’ which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known above all for being late.
It was a long journey, 3,144 kilometers to be exact, and I was nervous about the train’s reputation for delays. Mark Ottaway recounts his experience on the Ghan train:
The Ghan train travels through some of the most remote and rugged terrain in Australia, passing through the MacDonnell Ranges, the Finke Gorge National Park, and the Alice Springs Desert Park. The train itself is an old-fashioned one, with wooden compartments and a dining car serving meals that are both simple and delicious.
I was surprised by the beauty of the landscape, with its red earth, spinifex grass, and gum trees. As we travelled south, the temperature dropped, and the landscape became more arid and barren. I saw a kangaroo hopping across the track, and a group of emus taking off into the distance.
Despite the long journey and the occasional delay, I found the Ghan train to be an enjoyable experience. The train staff were friendly and helpful, and the other passengers were interesting and diverse. I met a couple of retired doctors who had travelled the world and were now making their way through Australia, and a group of backpackers who were on their way to Uluru.

B1,"Henry Ford Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863 but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen he began work as a mechanic and in 1893 he built his first car. After he had driven it 1500 kilometres he sold it and built two bigger cars. In 1903 he founded the Ford Motor Company and began producing his Model T cars. These cars were very successful and Ford became a very rich man. He was also very interested in technology and was a pioneer in using new materials and techniques to make his cars more efficient.

In 1915 Ford introduced the moving assembly line, which revolutionized the way cars were made. Instead of each car being made by hand, the parts were made in advance and then assembled on a moving belt. This made the process much faster and cheaper. Ford also introduced a new type of wage for his workers, known as the five-dollar day. This was much higher than the standard wage at the time and it helped to improve the lives of his workers.

In 1927 Ford became the first man to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. He was eighty-four years old at the time and he did it in a plane he had designed himself. Ford died in 1947 but his company continued to be successful and his legacy as a pioneer in the automobile industry lived on.

In conclusion, Henry Ford was a very important person in history because he was a pioneer in the automobile industry.

Now I looked down at the river far below me and realised why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. He had been climbing for a while and I had only recently started. We were there to try out the indoor climbing wall. I had been feeling a bit nervous on the way there but as soon as we walked in the door I knew I was in for an adventure. The centre was full of climbing equipment and enthusiastic climbers. Matt showed me around and introduced me to some of the staff. They were all very friendly and helpful. After a quick briefing on safety and climbing techniques we were ready to start climbing. The wall was huge and had a variety of routes to choose from, ranging from easy to very difficult. Matt suggested we start with something easy and work our way up. I agreed and we chose a route called 'The River'. It was a vertical climb with a few easy moves to start with and then a steep section towards the top. Matt belayed me while I climbed and I could feel his confidence in me as he pulled on the rope to keep me steady. I started to climb and my heart started to race. I was scared but I was determined to make it to the top. I put my hands on the wall and pulled myself up, one step at a time.

B1,"JAZZ By Katie Atkins aged 14 I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools – and our band won! Each band had their own costumes ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly-coloured T-shirts. The judges were professional musicians who had played in big bands before, so we were nervous but excited to show them what we could do. We played our set, which included a mix of old and new songs, and the crowd really got into it. When we finished, the judges gave us a round of applause and one of them even shouted out, “That was a great performance!” We didn’t win because of our costumes, but because of our talent and hard work. I’m so proud of my band and can’t wait to see what we can do next. 15

B1,"San Francisco San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it was discovered by land rather than by sea. San Francisco became an important port when California was admitted as the 31st state of the United States in 1850. During the 1849 Gold Rush San Francisco grew rapidly from a small town to a large city. The city was incorporated in 1850 with a population of about 2000 people. By 1870 the population had grown to 100000. During the 1860s and 1870s San Francisco was a major center for trade and shipping. The citys port was one of the busiest in the United States. In 1906 a devastating earthquake struck San Francisco causing widespread destruction and killing over 3000 people. The city was largely rebuilt in the following years. During World War II San Francisco played a major role in the war effort. Ships and troops were sent from the city to fight in the Pacific. After the war San Francisco continued to grow and develop. In the 1980s the city became a center for high technology industries. Today San Francisco is a major cultural and economic center known for its vibrant arts scene its beautiful architecture and its diverse population.

B1,"Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car recycling wine bottles not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out. I want to be clear about one thing right from the start - it wasn't my idea to become the BBC's ethical man. I was just a normal guy doing my job when someone at the BBC came up to me and said ""Hey Justin, we've got this new show and we think you'd be perfect for it. It's called 'Ethical Man' and it's all about living ethically in the modern world."" I was a bit taken aback, to be honest. I'm not sure I'm the most ethical person in the world, and I'm certainly not perfect. But I thought, why not give it a go? So I agreed to do the show and here I am. So what does it mean to live ethically in the modern world? Well, that's a really good question. I spent a year trying to find out. I talked to experts in various fields, from philosophy to psychology, and I tried to put their ideas into practice in my own life. I tried to be more mindful of my impact on the environment, and to make choices that are more ethical and sustainable. I'm not going to lie - it wasn't always easy. There were times when I felt like I was failing miserably, and there were times when I felt like giving up altogether. But I kept going, because I wanted to see if it was possible to live a truly ethical life in the modern world. And you know what? I think it is possible. Of course, it'"

By the time it was dark our camp had grown to more than fifty women. We had a small stage and we sang and danced for our sons. We had a drummer and we beat out a rhythm for our sons. We had a banner that read:

B1,"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod which means 'far distant place'. At first the town flourished, but as the gold ran out, the people of Iditarod had to find new ways to survive. They turned to dog sledding, hunting and fishing to make a living. The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race was born out of a need for survival and a love of the land. It was originally a mail delivery route, but when the post office closed in 1960, the race was born. The first Iditarod was run in 1973, and since then it has become one of the most famous dog sled races in the world. The race is 1,000 miles long and takes place in the harsh winters of Alaska. It is considered one of the last great races on earth because of the extreme conditions. The race is run on a trail that winds through mountains, forests and over rivers. The dogs and mushers must endure sub zero temperatures, blizzards, and other harsh weather conditions. The race is run every March and is considered one of the most challenging and dangerous races in the world. The Iditarod has a special place in the hearts of the people of Alaska and those who love dog sledding. It is a testament to the strength and resilience of the people who live in this vast and beautiful state. The race has become a symbol of the spirit of Al"

In many of the early zoos animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally. Zoos are now used for a variety of purposes, including education, conservation, and research.
The first modern zoo in Europe was established in Vienna in 1752, and the first zoo in the United States was opened in Philadelphia in 1873. Today, there are over 1,000 zoos worldwide, with over 700 of them located in Europe and Asia.
Zoos can be divided into several different types, including:
1. Large zoos: These are the largest and most well-known zoos, often located in urban areas and attracting millions of visitors each year. Examples include the Bronx Zoo in New York City and the San Diego Zoo in California.
2. Small zoos: These are smaller zoos, often located in rural areas and focusing on a specific type of animal or habitat. Examples include the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans and the Denver Zoo.
3. Specialized zoos: These are zoos that specialize in a particular type of animal, such as primates, reptiles, or birds. Examples include the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., which specializes in primates, and the Reptile Gardens in Rapid City, South Dakota, which specializes in reptiles.

It’s made from lots of different types of wood and they’ve even used recycled wood from old buildings. It’s going to be really good for the environment and it’s also going to be a great place to learn.
I’m really looking forward to starting lessons here. There are lots of new classrooms, a big library, a big playground and even a forest! That’s right, a forest right in the middle of the school. It’s going to be so much fun exploring it and learning about all the different plants and animals that live there.
I’m a little sad that our old school is no longer there but I’m also really excited about all the new things we’ll get to do and learn in our new school. It’s going to be a great adventure!
We’ve been very busy this week getting everything set up and organised. There are lots of new teachers and students to meet and it’s all a bit overwhelming but I’m sure we’ll all settle in soon.

It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 metres. The Skywalk is 40 feet away from the edge of the canyon. 

The Skywalk was built in 2007. It is a horseshoe-shaped walkway that allows visitors to walk out over the edge of the canyon. The Skywalk is made of steel and is 70 feet long. It is suspended 4,000 feet above the Colorado River and 1,000 feet above the canyon floor. The Skywalk is 15 feet wide and has a glass bottom that allows visitors to see the canyon floor below. The Skywalk is a popular attraction at the Grand Canyon and is a must-see for anyone visiting the park. 

Visitors to the Skywalk can walk out on the walkway and look over the edge of the canyon. The view is breathtaking and offers a unique perspective of the canyon. Visitors can also stand on the glass bottom of the Skywalk and look straight down to the canyon floor.

B1,"Watering the Desert  It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh Morocco. It doesn’t happen frequently and when it does the city’s water pipes can’t manage the sudden floods which turn the streets into rivers. But as many winters have remained dry in recent times when the rain does come it is welcomed by the local people. The city’s ancient walls and narrow streets are unable to cope with the deluge and the city’s water infrastructure is inadequate. The result is a city-wide mess. The streets are filled with water and the city’s inhabitants must navigate through the floods to reach their homes or places of work. The children play in the floodwaters and the adults try to keep their feet dry. The rain is a blessing but the city’s infrastructure is not equipped to handle it. The city is a desert and the rain is a rare and precious gift. But it is also a reminder of the city’s vulnerability to the vagaries of the weather.
Watering the desert is a metaphor for the struggle to create a sustainable future in a world that is increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The desert represents the barren landscape of a world that has been depleted of its natural resources and left vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate. The rain is a symbol of hope and renewal but it is also a reminder of the fragility of the ecosystem and the need to find sustainable solutions to the challenges that lie ahead.
Watering the desert is a challenge that requires the collective efforts of individuals, communities and governments. It involves finding innovative solutions to the problems of water scarcity and infrastructure"

Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course.

The children work together to prepare each dish, and they take turns being in charge of different tasks. They learn how to communicate with each other, how to share, and how to work as a team.

B1,"No Title Some people have complained about this year's collection New Writing 3 although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is pretty amazing? Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. The best of these is McWilliam's ""Away from It All"", a funny and poignant story about a family on holiday. Tremain's ""The Darkness of Wallis Simpson"" is also good, a well-observed piece about the Duchess of Windsor. There are also some talented newcomers, such as the American writer, Claire Messud, whose ""The Woman Who Might Become a Tree"" is a haunting story about a woman who has lost her memory. Non-fiction is also well-represented, with pieces by writers such as Ian McEwan and Alan Hollinghurst. Hollinghurst's ""The Sculpture Gallery"" is a particularly enjoyable piece, a witty and insightful look at the art world. Overall, this is an excellent collection of new writing, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading.

'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio then to press previews all before lunch. The studio was cold and dark and the lighting equipment was loud and clunky. The photographer was lovely and she explained what she wanted me to do. I had to hold a bird of prey and look like I was enjoying it. It was a bit tricky as the bird was a bit grumpy and I had to keep it warm. After lunch I went to a fashion show where I got to see all the latest fashions. It was amazing and I felt like a real fashionista. The models looked incredible and the clothes were stunning. I even got to try on some of the outfits and take pictures. After the fashion show I went to a press preview where I got to see some of the latest beauty products. It was so exciting to see all the new products and try them out. I even got to interview some of the beauty experts and ask them about their latest creations.

Dave and Norm Lagasse two bushy-bearded brothers in their forties are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico USA and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. It is a game of Risk, a classic strategy game that they have been playing since childhood. They are laughing and joking as they move their armies around the board, their voices rising and falling with excitement.

The game of Risk has taken on a new significance for the Lagasse brothers. They have created a version of the game that they are selling online and it has become a surprise hit. The brothers started creating their version of the game in their spare time, using their graphic design skills to create new pieces and rules. They had no idea if anyone would be interested in their version of the game, but they decided to give it a shot and post it online.

To their surprise, people started buying the game in droves. The Lagasse brothers have sold hundreds of copies of their version of Risk online, and they have received messages from people all over the world thanking them for creating a game that they love. The brothers are now working on a new version of the game, incorporating feedback from their customers and adding even more features.

The story of the Lagasse brothers and their version of Risk is a reminder that sometimes the things we loved as children can become the things we love as adults.

The door opened and a man entered, a tall thin man with a long grey beard and a rough looking hat. He was dressed in a long coat and carried a rough looking bag slung over his shoulder.

""Ah, Dr Kemp, I see you are still up,"" he said in a deep, rumbling voice.

""Ah, Mr Muller, good evening,"" Dr Kemp replied. ""I was just finishing up some work.""

""Indeed,"" Mr Muller said, his eyes scanning the room. ""I see you have a new patient. How is he?""

B2,"Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers fear that the 36000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so [line 6: beginning] rapidly that they will not survive for future generations. The ancient rock art, which includes images of animals, humans and abstract shapes, is believed to have been carved by the ancient inhabitants of the area between 10000 and 3000 years ago. The pictures are a valuable record of the culture and beliefs of these early inhabitants, and are considered an important part of France's cultural heritage. However, in recent years, tourists have been damaging the rock art by touching, climbing on and photographing the fragile drawings. The authorities are now taking steps to protect the site and prevent further damage. [line 7: beginning] The local government has set up a special task force to monitor the site and educate visitors about the importance of preserving the rock art. Signs have been put up around the area warning visitors not to touch or climb on the drawings, and guards have been hired to patrol the site and enforce the rules. The authorities are also working with local schools and community groups to promote the site as an important cultural and historical site, and to encourage visitors to respect and protect it. [line 13: end] The efforts are paying off, with a significant decrease in the number of visitors damaging the rock art in recent months. However, more work needs to be done to protect the site for future generations. The ancient rock art of Mont Bego is a precious cultural treasure, and it"
B2,"We are being bombarded with advertisements all the time and a lot of them are targeted at young people. Smaller children apart from spending their own pocket money can also influence what their parents buy so many TV ads are created with kids in mind. For example adverts for drinks feature cartoon animals.
The advertisements that are created for young people are often very persuasive and can have a big impact on their choices and preferences. Some of the most successful advertisements are those that are able to tap into the emotions of young people, such as nostalgia or excitement.
TV ads are often created to appeal to kids because they are a captive audience. They watch TV regularly and are more likely to pay attention to ads than adults. Many TV ads are also created to appeal to the desire for popularity and social status among young people.
Advertisers use various techniques to grab the attention of young people, such as catchy music, bright colors, and celebrity endorsements. They also use social media platforms to target young people with personalized ads that are tailored to their interests.
However, it is important to be aware of the potential negative impact of advertising on young people. Exposure to advertising can lead to materialism and consumerism, and can also contribute to body image issues and low self-esteem. Therefore, it is important to teach young people how to critically evaluate advertisements and make informed choices about what they buy.
In conclusion, advertisements are a common feature of modern life and are often targeted at young people. While advertisements can be persuasive and have a big impact on young people’s choices and preferences,"
B2,"No Title Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place that often worked. 
But this wasn't the 19th century, and the gold rush was long over. Instead, the search for a place to live in Dublin was a modern-day nightmare, with everyone clamoring for the same limited supply of apartments. 
As a young professional, I found myself part of this desperate scramble. I had just landed a job in Dublin and was eager to get settled in a place of my own. But the city's rental market was notoriously cutthroat, and I quickly realized that finding a decent flat was going to be a full-time job in itself. 
I began my search online, scouring listings on websites like Daft.ie and MyHome.ie. But the options were limited, and the prices were astronomical. A one-bedroom apartment in a decent neighborhood could cost upwards of €1,500 a month, and two-bedrooms were even more expensive. I knew I couldn't afford that, and I wasn't alone. 
Everywhere I turned, I heard stories of people struggling to find affordable housing in Dublin. Friends of mine were living in cramped shared apartments, paying exorbitant rents to landlords who didn't seem to care about their tenants' needs. Others were forced to move to the suburbs, where"

It was a paragraph about the strange disappearances of young women in the city. They had been vanishing without a trace for weeks, and the police were baffled. Some people believed it was the work of a serial killer, while others thought it was a ghost or a spirit.

As the crowd watched in amazement, Christine reappeared on the stage, unharmed and untroubled. She smiled and curtsied to the audience, as if nothing had happened. Raoul and Count Philippe were overjoyed to see her safe and sound, and they embraced her warmly.

But as the performance continued, strange things began to happen. The set began to change on its own, and the actors found themselves in unexpected places. The music grew louder and more dissonant, and the audience began to feel uneasy.

It was as if some malevolent force was at work, manipulating the play to its own ends. And as the curtain fell on the final act, the audience knew that they had witnessed something truly supernatural.

The Paris Opera House was never the same after that night. The disappearances of young women in the city continued, and people whispered of a ghostly presence that haunted the theater. Some claimed to have seen the spirit of Christine Daaé, doomed to repeat her final performance for eternity."

Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. We love to watch them frolic in the sea, their sleek bodies slicing through the waves. And we are mesmerised by their intelligence and playfulness. But despite their charms, dolphins are in trouble. Across the world, their numbers are declining at an alarming rate. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDC) says that dolphins are facing a desperate crisis. In some areas, their numbers have fallen by as much as 80 per cent in just a few years. The reasons are many and varied. Dolphins are being caught in fishing nets, hunted for food, and their habitats are being destroyed by pollution and overfishing. In some parts of the world, they are even being used as props in the entertainment industry, being pushed to the limits of their endurance and beyond. The WDC says that the situation is dire. If we don't act now, many dolphin species will be lost forever. The society is calling for urgent action to protect dolphins and their habitats. This includes banning the use of dolphins in entertainment, protecting their habitats from pollution and overfishing, and enforcing laws that prevent dolphins from being hunted or caught in fishing nets. The WDC is also working with governments and other organisations to raise awareness of the crisis"

In this quote, the speaker is suggesting that the constant connection and communication enabled by smartphones and the internet has led to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and deep thinking. The speaker has been researching this topic for fifteen years and has found that people are so busy communicating online that they don't have time for more meaningful, in-person interactions.

The speaker uses the phrase ""don't have time to think"" to emphasize that the constant distraction of online communication is hindering people's ability to reflect and focus on important things. The speaker also mentions that people don't have time to ""sit down and have a conversation,"" which suggests that the pace of life has become so fast that even simple social interactions are difficult to fit into people's schedules.

Overall, the speaker is arguing that the constant connectivity enabled by technology is having a negative impact on people's ability to connect with each other and with themselves. The speaker is urging people to slow down and prioritize face-to-face interactions and deep thinking in order to lead more fulfilling and meaningful lives.

B2,"Hamlet was angry that she should give such a dear and respectful name as father to the murderer of his true father and he replied sharply 'Mother you have much offended my father.' The queen asked him if he had forgotten who he was speaking to. 'Oh!' replied Hamlet. 'I wish I could forget. If memory be not a curse, it is a torment to me. I have a bit of paper on which I have written a speech, and I will read it to you, for I have no mind to be balked in my design by a woman's scorn.'

Hamlet's anger and resentment towards his mother is evident in his speech to her. He is deeply offended that she would give such a reverent name as 'father' to the man who murdered his true father, and he lashes out at her, calling her a 'woman' and accusing her of offending his father. He also expresses his frustration at his own inability to forget the past and the memory of his father, which he sees as a curse or a torment. Hamlet's anger and resentment towards his mother serves to highlight the deep-seated emotional pain and turmoil that he is experiencing throughout the play. 

In addition, Hamlet's use of the phrase 'a bit of paper on which I have written a speech' also suggests that he is struggling to find the words to express his feelings and to articulate his thoughts and desires. This highlights the complex and convoluted nature of Hamlet's emotional state, and the difficulties he faces in trying to navigate his own thoughts and feelings. Overall, Hamlet's"

'My husband and I moved out of London to the country when our children were small and I wanted work I could do at home. I set up my business three years ago and it has grown steadily since then. The main challenge is getting people to know about my business - there are no other businesses like mine in the area and the nearest town is 15 miles away. I use the local press and put up posters in the village to advertise my services and have also started selling my products online. I have a very loyal customer base and I love the freedom and flexibility of working for myself.' B.

B2,"Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves. In On the Origin of Species published in 1859 Darwin described the process of natural selection. The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. This leads to gradual changes over generations and eventually to the development of new species. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection challenged traditional religious and scientific beliefs and has had a profound impact on modern biology medicine genetics and philosophy.
Charles Darwin was born in Shrewsbury England on February 12 1809. He was the fifth of six children born to Robert Waring Darwin a physician and naturalist and Susannah Wedgwood Darwin a member of a prominent pottery family. Darwin's early life was marked by illness and the death of his mother when he was just eight years old. Despite these challenges he excelled at school and went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Darwin then spent several years traveling on the Beagle a British navy ship as a naturalist. During this time he collected numerous specimens and observed geological features that helped shape his ideas about evolution.
Darwin returned to England in 1836 and began to write up his notes from the Beagle voyage. He spent the next several years working on his book which was eventually published in 1859 as On the Origin of Species. The book was an instant success and sparked a revolution in the way people understood the natural world.

It's a large house by the sea not far from the village of Ardbeag. It was always the same routine, a lazy fortnight of reading, swimming, and walking along the coast. It was our own little world, far removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. We would spend our days lounging on the beach, or exploring the nearby cliffs and coves. We had a routine that never varied, and yet it was always exciting. The first few days we would spend getting to know the area, finding the best spots for swimming and exploring the local villages. After that it was a matter of enjoying each other's company and the peace and quiet of the Irish coast. We would take long walks along the beach, watching the sunset and the stars come out at night. We would have picnics on the rocks and dunes, and sometimes we would even take a boat trip to see the coast from a different perspective. We were a group of friends who had known each other since school, and our holidays together were something we all looked forward to. We had no children, no partners, no work worries to speak of. Just each other and the sea. And so every year we would make our way to Glencorn Lodge, ready to relax and enjoy each other's company in the beautiful Irish countryside.

But now it was not the world's only network of computers. After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful other networks began to appear.

In 1979 the first commercial network was launched in the United States. This network was called the CompuServe network and it was used by thousands of people. Other networks soon followed including the Prodigy network which was launched in 1984.

But the ARPAnet continued to be the largest and most advanced network of its time. It was still the network that other networks were modeled after. And it continued to grow and change as new technology became available.

In 1983 the ARPAnet was connected to the international network of computers known as the Internet. This allowed people to communicate with computers in other countries. And it marked the beginning of the modern Internet as we know it today.

The ARPAnet was a very important part of the history of computers. It was the first network of computers and it paved the way for the modern Internet. Without the ARPAnet it is unlikely that the Internet would exist today.

In conclusion, the ARPAnet was a groundbreaking computer network that revolutionized the way people communicate and share information. It was the first network of computers and it paved the way for the modern Internet.

'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. He was growing fast and was soon to be the tallest person in the class. So much so that he was worried he wouldn’t be able to fit in a submarine. So, he decided to take matters into his own hands and do something about it. He got in touch with the Royal Navy and they were amazed by his height. They invited him to come and see what life was like on a submarine. They even gave him his own set of naval uniforms. So, Chris set off for Portsmouth and onto the submarine HMS Sceptre. And what he saw amazed him. He saw the crew working together like a well-oiled machine, the captain standing at the helm and the sonar operator peering into the depths of the sea.

B2,"In 1998 the world-class Moroccan athlete Hicham El Guerrouj broke the 1500-metres world record with a time of three minutes twenty-six seconds. Nearly fifteen years later nobody has beaten that time. Have we got to the human speed limit? Dr Frances Ashcroft Professor of Physiology at Oxford University explains the limits of the human body during a race.

Hicham El Guerrouj's time of three minutes twenty-six seconds in the 1500-metres is the world record that has stood for nearly fifteen years. This is an incredible achievement that highlights the remarkable endurance and athleticism of the Moroccan athlete. However, it also raises the question of whether we have reached the human speed limit.

As a Professor of Physiology at Oxford University, I can explain that there are several physiological factors that limit an athlete's performance during a race. These include the body's ability to deliver oxygen to the muscles, the efficiency of the cardiovascular system, and the body's ability to remove waste products such as lactic acid.

One of the key factors that determines an athlete's speed is their VO2 max, or maximum oxygen uptake. This is the amount of oxygen that the body can use during intense exercise. The higher an athlete's VO2 max, the faster they can run. However, there is a limit to how high an athlete's VO2 max can be, and this is determined by genetics and training.

Another important factor is the body's ability to buffer lactic acid. Lactic acid is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, which occurs"

Jake laughed when first the national TV channels and then Memphis then Jackson then Ripelo ended their broadcasts with no news about the Hailey trial and no pictures of Buckley on the screen. At ten Jake and his wife Carla lay in the dark on the sofa waiting for the news.
""It's like they're hiding something,"" Carla said.
""Buckley's probably just taking a break,"" Jake said. ""He's got a lot on his plate.""
""But where's the trial? Where's Buckley?""
""I don't know, Carla. Maybe he's just taking a little extra time to make sure the case is airtight.""

Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion this is not typical. More usually great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page.

The editors' code of practice is a set of guidelines that newspaper editors follow to ensure that they are not intruding on people's privacy or breaking the law when taking and publishing photographs. However, week after week, British tabloid newspapers continue to carry pictures that violate these guidelines and invade people's privacy. Although celebrities may pose for paparazzi on occasion, the majority of the time, great harm is done to individuals in the public eye when their most private moments are captured on the front page.

The code of practice sets out rules for photographers, including that they should not intrude on people's privacy or cause unnecessary distress, and that they should not publish photographs of children or young people without their consent. However, these rules are frequently flouted, and the privacy of individuals in the public eye is often disregarded in the pursuit of sensational headlines and sales.

The impact of this intrusion on privacy can be significant, leading to feelings of vulnerability and distress for those involved. It can also damage reputations and relationships, and create a culture of fear and mistrust around the media.

The issue of privacy invasion by the tabloid press is not a new one, and has been the subject of numerous high-profile court cases and public debates. However, despite"

The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them. There was new furniture and Paul had a teacher. He was really going to Eton his father's school in the following autumn.

Uncle Oscar had gone mad. He was babbling incoherently in the garden, and Paul's mother was frantic with worry. She tried to get him to stop, but he just kept on talking and laughing, completely out of control.

As for Paul, he was in a state of shock. He had never seen anything like this before, and he didn't know what to do. He just stood there, frozen in fear, as the voices in the house grew louder and more intense.

And then, just as suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. The voices disappeared, and Uncle Oscar collapsed to the ground, exhausted. Paul's mother rushed over to him and helped him inside, where she tried to calm him down and make him rest.

But Paul couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had settled in his stomach. He knew that something strange had happened, and he couldn't help but wonder if it would happen again. And as he lay in bed that night, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being watched, that the voices in the house were still there, waiting for him.

As for Uncle Oscar, he never fully recovered from his madness. He spent the rest of his days in and out of hospitals and institutions, never quite making sense again. And as for Paul,"

B2,"ICE SKATING Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill. It was considered a sign of nobility and a way of traveling. Ice skating was also used for military purposes. The Dutch are often credited with inventing the modern ice skate in the 13th century. They made the skate with a curved blade and added a runners on the bottom of the skate. The skate was held onto with a strap. The Dutch also developed the ""Dutch Waltz"" which was a dance that could be performed on the ice. The Dutch Waltz became popular throughout Europe and was danced in palaces and public skating rinks. In the 16th century the French added a metal tip to the skate to provide more stability. The metal tip also made it easier to stop. In the 18th century skating became a popular recreational activity for the middle class. Skating was also used as a form of exercise and as a way to socialize. Ice skating has a long and rich history and it continues to be a popular recreational activity today.

Or have you followed every piece of news on the front page of a news website? It's practically impossible. Reuters alone puts out 3.5 million news stories a year. And that's just one source.
So what do you do when you can't keep up? Here are some strategies to help you cope:
1. Prioritize: Decide what's important to you and focus on that. If you're interested in politics, read the political news. If you're interested in sports, read the sports news. Don't try to keep up with everything.
2. Use filters: Use social media filters to curate the news for you. Many news sources have Facebook or Twitter accounts where they post their latest stories. You can also use news aggregator apps like Flipboard or Apple News to curate the news for you.
3. Read summaries: Instead of reading the full story, read the summary or the headline. If you're not interested in the topic, move on.
4. Skim and scan: Instead of reading every word of a news article, skim and scan the headlines and summaries. If you don't see anything that interests you, move on.
5. Use newsletters: Many news sources offer daily or weekly newsletters that summarize the top stories of the day. These can be a great way to stay informed without having to read every article.

B2,"Favourite places Bruce I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me not empty deserts. When I was eight I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. The church there is a very old one with a square tower and I was always fascinated by it. I have a lot of pictures of it. Now I am 80 years old and I still love that church.

Answer: Bruce is an 80-year-old man who prefers human-inhabited landscapes to untamed ones. He enjoys visiting old villages with historic temples, rather than empty deserts. When he was a child, he would cycle to the village of Lastingham in England, where he found an old church with a square tower that fascinated him. Even at 80 years old, he still holds a special affection for that church.

Explanation:

Bruce's preference for landscapes with human elements is evident in his choice of favourite places. He chooses villages with old temples over untamed deserts, indicating that he finds human-inhabited landscapes more appealing. His fondness for the village of Lastingham in England is also indicative of this preference, as he describes the church there as a ""very old one with a square tower"" that he was ""always fascinated by.""

Bruce's love for the church in Lastingham has endured for many years, as he is still attached to it at the age of 80. This suggests that his appreciation for the"

A murder is announced and will take place on Friday October 29th at Little Paddocks at 6.30 p.m. The victim will be a man of considerable wealth and prominence in the community. The police are baffled and are offering a large reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminal. The crime is believed to be the work of a lunatic and the police are warning the public to be on their guard against any attempts at blackmail.' 'Oh rot!' said Colonel Easterbrook. 'Who's going to be murdered? Someone in this house perhaps? Archie do you think it might be one of us?' 'Oh dear' said Mrs Easterbrook. 'I do hope not.'

The passage is a dialogue between Colonel and Mrs Easterbrook, who are discussing a news article they have read in The Times. Colonel Easterbrook is dismissive of the article, believing that the murder described in it is nonsense, while Mrs Easterbrook is more interested and concerned about the possibility that someone in their own household might be the victim.

The dialogue is natural and fluid, with each character's speech being distinct and easy to follow.

The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser.

Legally it belonged to the People's Republic of China a part of the colony that was never British. In fact neither Chinese nor British law had effect there. It was a lawless place.

The Kowloon Walled City was a unique place, with a history that spanned over 400 years. It was a small area, measuring only about 27 acres, but it was home to over 50,000 people in its heyday in the mid-20th century. Despite its small size, the Kowloon Walled City was a self-contained community with its own economy, culture, and social structure. It was a place where people from all over China and beyond came to seek a better life, and it became infamous for its narrow alleys, overcrowding, and lack of basic services such as electricity and sanitation.

The Kowloon Walled City was built in the 14th century as a fortified outpost for the Ming dynasty, and it remained under Chinese jurisdiction even after Hong Kong was ceded to the British in 1842. Over the centuries, the city became a haven for criminal activity, and by the mid-20th century, it was notorious for its triad gangs, drug trafficking, and other illegal activities. Despite its lawlessness, the Kowloon Walled City was also a place of great resilience and resourcefulness, with its residents adapting to the challenges of living in such"

There were lots of rides and attractions that were perfect for our three-year-old and the older kids had a great time too. The water park was fantastic and we spent hours splashing about in the sun. The only downside was that some of the rides were too intense for our youngest, but the staff were really helpful and made sure she had a great time too.

I'm not naturally confident but I've learned to fake it until I make it. It's about putting on a good face and pretending to be more confident than you feel. It can be a useful tool when you're feeling nervous or unsure of yourself. Tim Ferris. I believe that confidence comes from a sense of control and competence. When you feel like you're in control of your life and your abilities you're more likely to feel confident. It's about setting goals and working towards them and feeling a sense of accomplishment when you achieve them. Oprah Winfrey. Confidence comes from within it's not something you can buy or pretend. It's about having a positive mindset and believing in yourself even when things are difficult. It's about being kind to yourself and recognizing your own worth. Tony Robbins. I asked them what advice they would give to someone who wants to become more confident and they all said the same thing. Practice self
B2,"Trills and bills If there's one thing guaranteed to send tears running down your cheeks it's the sight of a brilliant child collecting a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young stars and their mothers to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. A. Annika Reeder 15 won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. Her mother, Claire, a former gymnast herself, is her biggest fan. Claire: 'Annika is a perfectionist and she hates making mistakes. But I tell her all the time that it's okay to make mistakes, that it's how we learn and grow. I'm so proud of her, but I also worry about the pressure she's under to perform. She's always been dedicated to her sport, but I don't want her to burn out.' Annika: 'Sometimes I feel like I'm always training and never really getting to relax. But when I'm on the mat, I feel like I can be myself and do my best. Winning the gold medal was amazing, but it's also made me realise that there's so much more to life than just gymnastics.' B. Ella Fletcher 12 won a silver medal for swimming at the European Junior Championships. Her father, Simon, is her coach and biggest supporter. Simon: 'Ella has always been a natural in the water. She loves the feeling of being in the pool and pushing herself to be faster and stronger. She's got a great attitude and a fantastic work ethic, but I also worry about the amount of time she spends training. She's missed out on so much of her childhood because of her commitment to swimming.'"

B2,The kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and riversfeeding on fish. Old trees overhang the stream half shading shallow water. Soft greens mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze. A kingfisher darts low over the water its blue-green back flashing as it goes.  A moment later it dives headlong into the water and disappears. The dive is so fast that the water seems to ripple only where the kingfisher has gone.  It reappears with a small fish in its beak and flies back to its perch on a tree branch above the stream. Charlie James has spent years studying the kingfisher and capturing its beauty on camera. In his photographs the bird is shown in different lighting conditions and from different angles. He has also captured the kingfishers predatory habits and its relationship with its environment. James has written a book about the kingfisher and its natural history which is a comprehensive guide to the birds habits habitats and behaviours. He has also produced a series of educational videos that show the kingfisher in its natural habitat. James has received many awards for his photography and conservation work including the Wildlife Photographer of the Year award in 2005. His photographs have been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world and have been published in numerous magazines and books. He continues to travel the world in search of new and exciting wildlife photography subjects.  He is a well-known and respected figure in the field of wildlife photography and is widely regarded as one of
B2,"Studio Audiences What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical difficultiesstudio audiences are just another common feature of television lifeand yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows for example we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? And how on earth do they manage to stay so cheerful even when the contestants are being eliminated one by one? But the truth is that studio audiences are made up of ordinary people just like you and me - people who have been plucked from their everyday lives and brought together to watch and react to the action on stage. ""They're a cross-section of the viewing public"" explains David Hatch, the controller of BBC2. ""They're not actors or professional audience members - they're just ordinary people who happen to be interested in the show."" So what's it like to be in a studio audience? Cosmo Landesman found out when he visited the set of a popular daytime quiz show. ""As we filed into the studio I couldn't help but notice the buzz of excitement in the air. Everyone was chatting and laughing and the atmosphere was electric. It was like being part of a big social event - but with the added bonus of getting to see the show for free!"" The first thing that struck me as we took our seats was the sheer scale of the set. It was huge - with towering video screens and a vast stage that seemed to stretch on forever. And yet despite its size the studio still had a cozy feel to it - like a big living room where everyone was gathered to watch a favourite TV show. As the cameras rolled and the quiz"
B2,"It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. The teacher suggested that Chris might want to consider a different career path - but Chris was determined. He joined the navy at sixteen and quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the most senior officers in the service.
But life in the navy wasn’t all plain sailing. Chris faced many challenges on his journey to the top - from bullies who teased him about his height to the pressures of command and the dangers of war. But he never let his size hold him back - and he never forgot the lessons he learned from his teacher. As he said in a speech to young sailors: 'Size may not matter - but it can certainly help you make a bigger impact.' Chris Greener proved that with hard work and determination anything is possible - even for a teenager who thought he was too big for his boots.
What does the text say about Chris Greener?
Chris Greener was 14 years old when he told his careers teacher that he wanted to join the navy.

B2,"In April 1919 the British rulers in India decided to put down protests in the city of Amritsar. As people gathered in the public garden during the festival of Vaisakhi a British general ordered his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd. As well as thousands of injuries there were hundreds of deaths. The event became known as the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
The British government tried to cover up the event but the news of the massacre spread quickly and outrage was felt all over the world. The event was seen as a brutal reminder of the British rule in India and the injustice of imperialism.
In 1920 the Indian National Congress held a meeting in Lahore to protest against the massacre. The meeting was attended by hundreds of delegates from all over India and the Congress leaders called for a boycott of British goods and a non-cooperation movement against British rule.
The non-cooperation movement started in 1920 and lasted for several years. Many Indians refused to work in government offices, courts, and other institutions. They also refused to pay taxes and boycotted British goods.
The movement was led by Mahatma Gandhi who had returned to India from South Africa in 1915. Gandhi was a skilled lawyer and had been involved in the fight against racial discrimination in South Africa. He had also been influenced by the ideas of Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy who had written about the importance of non-violent resistance.
Gandhi believed that non-violent resistance was the most effective way to achieve Indian independence from British rule. He called for a movement of civil disob"
B2,"GM's clever EN-V concept is a two-wheeled two-seater solution to urban transport. Telegraph Motoring's Mike Rutherford has a preview and takes it for a spin. That's because of the nature of the EN-V. Last week I drove one of these though it was more like flying a small plane than driving. The EN-V is General Motors' vision of the future of personal transportation in urban areas. It's a two-wheeled, two-seater vehicle that uses electric motors and lithium-ion batteries to get around.
The EN-V is a very clever concept, and it's easy to see how it could be popular in urban areas. It's small, agile and easy to park, making it perfect for navigating crowded city streets. And with a range of around 40 miles on a single charge, it's also environmentally friendly.
I was lucky enough to get behind the wheel of an EN-V recently, and I have to say it was an incredible experience. It's a bit like flying a small plane, as you sit in a cockpit with your feet on a pedal to control the direction of the vehicle. But it's also very intuitive and easy to use, and the acceleration is incredible.
The EN-V is also equipped with a number of advanced technologies, including a range of sensors and cameras that help to keep the vehicle safe and on course. These technologies include lane departure warning, forward collision warning, and blind spot detection, among others.
Overall, the EN-V is a very impressive concept that could potentially revolutionize the way we get around in urban areas. While it'"

B2,"What would happen to our planet if humans were to suddenly disappear? This is the basic hypothesis behind Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us. Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear. In one chapter there is an analysis of how New York would survive if there were no humans to take care of it.

The book was published in 2007 and has been translated into many languages. It has received critical acclaim for its unique perspective on the relationship between humans and the environment. The book has also been the subject of controversy, with some critics arguing that it presents a pessimistic view of the future of humanity.

The World Without Us is divided into several chapters, each of which explores the fate of a different aspect of human civilization if humans were to suddenly disappear. Some of the chapters examine how natural processes would reclaim abandoned cities, how plants and animals would adapt to the absence of humans, and how the Earth's geology would change over time.

One of the most interesting aspects of the book is its examination of how different materials and structures would fare in the absence of humans. For example, Weisman notes that concrete, which is made from limestone and sand, would begin to break down after a few decades without humans to maintain it. Similarly, steel, which is made from iron and carbon, would rust and corrode without the presence of humans to preserve it.

The book also explores the impact of human activities on the environment, and how these activities would cease without humans around to perpetuate them. For example, Weisman notes that the burning of fossil fuels would stop, leading to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and a subsequent cool"
B2,"Living in the valley We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival. It was the year when the storms came early before the calendar even hinted at winter even before November was out. The winds were fierce and the rain was relentless. The valley was a beautiful place. We had built our home there, surrounded by hills and fields of golden wheat that glistened in the sun. The air was crisp and clean, and we had grown our own food, raised our own animals and lived off the land. But the storms that came that year changed everything. At first, we thought it was just a bad storm, one that would pass. But it didn't. The winds howled and the rain pounded for days, until the valley was flooded and our home was in danger of being washed away. We knew we had to act fast to save our home and our family. We worked tirelessly, day and night, to build a wall of earth and rocks to protect our home from the floodwaters. We worked together, as a family, and our neighbours joined us too, and together we managed to save our homes and our livelihoods. But even after the storm had passed, we knew that we couldn't just sit back and relax. We knew that we had to prepare for the next storm, and the one after that. We knew that we had to be ready for anything that might come our way. And so we did. We built a community, a group of people who were prepared to work together to protect each other and their homes. We shared our resources and our knowledge"

""Hello there Seymour,"" she said in a high-pitched voice. ""I'm Rita Cohen. I've come to see you about a job.""

Seymour was taken aback. ""A job? What kind of job?""

Rita hesitated, then said, ""Well, I'm good at cleaning. And I'm good at cooking. And I'm good at taking care of children. I'm willing to work hard for a fair wage.""

Seymour raised an eyebrow. ""You're good at taking care of children? How old are you, Rita?""

Rita smiled shyly. ""I'm six years old, but I'm very mature for my age.""

Seymour couldn't help but laugh. ""I see. Well, I'm afraid I don't have any work for you, Rita. My daughter Marie is old enough to take care of herself, and I have a cleaning woman who comes in once a week.""

Rita's face fell, but she said, ""Oh, that's okay. I understand. Maybe you'll need someone someday.""

B2,"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Early identification and nurturing of a child's musical talent can help them to reach their full potential. But this requires a concerted effort from parents, teachers and the child themselves. Here are some key ways to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability: 1. Encourage and support their musical interests: Listen to their preferences and provide opportunities for them to explore different styles of music. Enroll them in music lessons or classes that cater to their interests and abilities. 2. Provide a supportive environment: Create a home environment that fosters musical growth. Provide access to music-making tools and equipment, such as instruments or recording software. Encourage them to practice and play music regularly. 3. Set achievable goals and celebrate successes: Help your child set realistic goals and work towards them. Celebrate their achievements, no matter how small, to reinforce their motivation and confidence. 4. Help them find balance: While it's important to encourage and support their musical interests, it's equally important to ensure they have a balanced life. Encourage them to pursue other interests and activities, such as sports, art or drama. 5. Be patient and understanding: Developing musical talent takes time and effort. Be patient with your child and understand that they may encounter setbacks or frustrations along the way. Offer support"

'After 14 years in business I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. I was 40 and I thought, ""What am I doing here? I'm not getting any younger and I'm not enjoying this"".' He met his wife, Rachel, who grew up on a farm, and they decided to make a change. 'I started to think about what I enjoyed doing and what made me happy. I was always outdoors and I loved working with animals, so I thought, ""Let's give this a go"".' Matt and Rachel now run a 300-acre farm in North Yorkshire with 200 ewes, 50 rams and 10 cows. 'It's hard work but it's rewarding. I get up every morning and I feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. I'm not just making money for someone else, I'm making a living for myself and my family.' Matt and Rachel have three children, aged 8, 6 and 4, and they all help out on the farm.

Yet to me there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival the pleasure of seeing who it is from and finally the enjoyment of the contents. It is a tangible piece of communication that can be kept for years to come.

As a writer I am particularly fond of letters and the stories they tell. I have spent countless hours pouring over old letters from loved ones and historical figures alike. The insights into their lives their thoughts and feelings are invaluable.

But letters are not just a source of entertainment or historical insight. They are also a way to connect with others. Whether it is a letter to a friend a family member or even a complete stranger the act of putting pen to paper and sending it off into the world is a powerful way to build connections.

Of course there are many ways to communicate in today’s world. Emails texts and social media can all be quick and easy ways to reach out to others. But there is something special about a letter. It is a tangible piece of communication that can be kept for years to come.

So I urge you to write a letter today. Whether it is to a friend a family member or even a complete stranger the act of putting pen to paper and sending it off into the world is a powerful way to connect with others. And who knows maybe years from now someone will be pouring over your letters and learning about the person behind them.

C1,"We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
The Concept:
Four people from different walks of life - a tech entrepreneur, a stay-at-home mom, a high school student, and a retiree - were chosen to participate in a unique experiment. For one day, they would each live the life of someone else.
The Experiment:
Each participant was given a detailed profile of the person they would be switching lives with, including their background, interests, and daily routine. They were also given a set of instructions on how to act and dress like their new identity.
The tech entrepreneur became a stay-at-home mom, taking care of her children and managing the household. The stay-at-home mom became a high school student, attending classes and dealing with the challenges of adolescence. The high school student became a retiree, enjoying leisure activities and spending time with friends. And the retiree became a tech entrepreneur, working in a fast-paced startup and navigating the cutthroat world of business.
The Results:
The participants were given a day to experience life as someone else, and their reactions were fascinating. The tech entrepreneur found it difficult to keep up with the constant demands of childcare, while the stay-at-home mom struggled to keep up with the rigors of high school."
C1,"Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country says Georgina Ferry but she is little known For the past four years I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. The reaction is always the same. Some people look blank. Others say ""Dorothy who?"" And then there are those who say ""Isn't she the one who won the Nobel prize?"" Yes she is. But despite her achievements Hodgkin remains a largely unsung heroine in her own country. Georgina Ferry is a science writer and the author of a new biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. She says Hodgkin's lack of recognition is not just a British problem but a global one. The reason is simple: science is still a male dominated field and women scientists often struggle to get the recognition they deserve. In this case Hodgkin's gender and her field of work biochemistry which was seen as a male preserve at the time made it even harder for her to get the recognition she deserved. But there is also a more subtle reason why Hodgkin's achievements have gone largely unnoticed. Science is a complex and esoteric subject and many people simply don't understand it. They may be vaguely aware of the big names in science like Einstein and Watson but beyond that they are lost. This means that even when women scientists do achieve great things they are often overlooked because their work is not seen as being of interest to the general public. So here's to Dorothy Hodgkin may she soon be a"

I studied fine art at university and specialized in painting. After graduating, I worked as a freelance artist for several years before discovering trompe-l'oeil.

C1,"New In Paperback A. The career of citizen Tristan Smith set in the fictional republic of Efica is an extraordinary parable of human power history and humour. In a feat of considerable literary skill the author has created a world with its own history traditions and customs. From the opening pages of this book we are drawn into a world of intrigue and adventure as Tristan navigates the complexities of political life in Efica. With a keen eye for the absurdities of power the author takes us on a wild ride through the corridors of power as Tristan rises from obscurity to become the most powerful man in the land. At every turn we are reminded of the dangers of ambition and the corrupting influence of power. But we are also shown the redemptive power of humour and the importance of staying true to oneself in the face of overwhelming pressure. A book that will appeal to fans of political satire and those looking for a compelling tale of personal transformation. Highly recommended. --Peter Carey, author of Parrot and Olivier in America

C1,"A trumpet isn’t just for Christmas… It is strange how many musicians even leading ones come from homes without music. Out of the blue Hakan Hardenberger the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world’s trumpet-players today. He has a tone so rich and beautiful that it has been described as “a revelation” and “the most beautiful sound I have ever heard on the trumpet”.

Hardenberger was born in the small town of Växjö, Sweden, where his parents ran a grocery store. Despite their lack of musical background, they encouraged Hardenberger's interest in music from an early age. He began playing the trumpet at the age of 8, and quickly showed a natural talent for the instrument.

Hardenberger's talent was recognized early on by his teachers, who praised his unique sound and technical ability. He went on to study at the Royal College of Music in London, where he graduated with honors.

Since then, Hardenberger has established himself as one of the world's leading trumpet players. He has performed with many of the world's top orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic. He has also collaborated with a wide range of conductors and musicians, including Simon Rattle, Claudio Abbado, and Joshua Bell.

Hardenberger's unique tone and artistic vision have earned him widespread critical acclaim. The Guardian described his playing as ""a revelation,"" while The Times called him ""the most beautiful sound I have ever heard on the"

C1,"He had said exactly the name Emma wanted him to say. Now she could suggest that it was difficult to explain matters by letter and she offered to go over to Rouen and speak to him directly. Charles would not hear of troubling her. She insisted. It was a battle of kindness. He was not going to be swayed.

What does the phrase ""a battle of kindness"" mean in this context?

A battle of kindness refers to a situation where two people are trying to be kind and considerate towards each other, but their efforts are met with resistance or unwillingness on the part of the other person. In this context, Emma is trying to be kind and accommodating towards Charles, but he is not willing to listen to her or change his mind. The phrase suggests a delicate and polite conflict, rather than a heated or confrontational one. It implies that both parties are motivated by a desire to be kind and help each other, but they are unable to find a solution due to their differing perspectives or priorities. 

In essence, it is a battle of wills, where both parties are trying to be kind, but the other person is not willing to budge. The phrase is often used to describe situations where people are trying to be polite and considerate, but their efforts are met with resistance or indifference. It is a common phenomenon in social interactions, where people may try to be kind, but the other person is not receptive to their advances. The phrase is a way of acknowledging and describing this type of situation, where kindness is met with resistance or indifference. 

In this context, Emma is trying to be kind"

C1,"Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession A The rules for work are changing We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are or by our training and expertise but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other.
Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession. He argues that emotional intelligence is the key to success in business and in life. Goleman defines emotional intelligence as the ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and to use emotions to facilitate thinking and decision-making. He identifies five components of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. He also offers practical advice on how to develop these skills, including exercises and techniques for increasing emotional intelligence.
Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ is a book written by Daniel Goleman, first published in 1995. The book argues that emotional intelligence (EI) is a crucial factor in determining how well a person can navigate their way through life and achieve their goals. Goleman defines emotional intelligence as the ability to recognize and understand emotions in oneself and others, and to use emotions to facilitate thinking and decision-making. He suggests that EI is a key factor in determining success in both personal and professional life, and that it can be more important than IQ in determining a person's overall success.
Emotional intelligence is a term used to describe a set of skills and abilities that"

Stuart Harris reports
Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one?
When selecting a clock radio, consider the following features:
1. Sound quality: Look for a clock radio with good sound quality. You want to be able to hear the radio clearly, without any distortion or muffling.
2. Display size: Consider the size of the display on the clock radio. A larger display is easier to read, especially if you have trouble seeing small print.
3. Alarm features: Think about how you want the alarm to work. Do you want a traditional beeping alarm, or something more unique? Some clock radios offer features like a snooze function, multiple alarms, or a gradual wake-up feature.
4. Additional features: Some clock radios come with additional features like a built-in speakerphone, a USB port for charging your phone, or a Bluetooth connection for streaming music.
5. Price: Clock radios can range in price from around $30 to over $200. Consider how much you're willing to spend and look for a clock radio that fits within your budget.

C1,"P. D. James Barbara Michaels meets the acclaimed crime writer whose innocent exterior hides a complex and brilliant imagination. Best-selling crime writer P.D. James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase as a headmistress of a girls' school. But this seemingly unassuming woman is a master of intricate plotting, and her novels are as cerebral as they are compulsive.

Born in Oxford in 1920, James studied English literature at Cambridge University, where she met her future husband, a clergyman. She began writing in her late 30s, publishing her first novel, Cover Her Face, in 1962. Since then, she has written 13 novels, including the best-selling Death in Holy Orders and The Murder Room. Her work is characterized by its complex plots, vivid characters, and intellectual rigor. James's detectives are often amateur sleuths or police officers, and her stories are set in a world of high society, where the secrets and lies are as plentiful as the champagne and caviar.

James's writing process is meticulous and slow. She spends years researching and outlining her novels, and then she writes the first draft in longhand. She edits the manuscript extensively, often rewriting entire sections to get the tone and pacing just right. Her attention to detail is evident in the intricate plots and characterizations that have made her a beloved figure in the world of crime fiction.

Despite her success, James remains humble and unassuming. She lives in a"

C1,"BRINGING UP BADGERS ‘What now?’ was my immediate thought as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‘open farm’ six years ago we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. We’ve had everything from lambs and piglets to wallabies and even a couple of baby rhinos! But I’d never seen a badger cub in a cardboard box before. ‘What’s in the box?’ I asked my helper, my heart racing with excitement. ‘It’s a badger cub, ma’am,’ he replied, his voice barely above a whisper. ‘It was found in a ditch nearby, all alone and scared. We thought it would be better off here with us’. I couldn’t believe it! Badgers are usually nocturnal creatures, living underground in setts, so to see one up close and personal was a real treat. I quickly got to work, setting up a special enclosure for the cub, complete with a warm, cosy bed and plenty of milk to drink. As I watched the cub exploring its new surroundings, I couldn’t help but wonder what had happened to its mother. Had she been killed or injured? Or had she simply abandoned it? Whatever the reason, I knew that the badger cub was now safe and cared for, and that was all that mattered. As the days passed, the cub grew bigger and stronger, and it soon became clear that it was time to release it back into the wild. It was a sad moment for all of us, but we knew that it was for the"
C1,"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. We want to know what the critics think. And if the reviews are good, we know we have a hit on our hands. The impact of a review can be huge. We've seen books go from obscurity to bestseller status based solely on the power of a good review. Publisher B Reviews are important, but they're not the only factor. We look at the author's track record, the genre, the cover, the title - all of these things come into play when deciding whether or not to publish a book. While a good review can certainly help, it's not the only thing that matters. Publisher C Reviews can make a big difference, but they're not the only reason we publish a book. We also look at the book's potential to sell in the long term. If we think a book has legs, we'll take a chance on it, even if the reviews are mixed. Publisher D Reviews are helpful, but we don't put too much stock in them. We look at the book's overall quality and whether or not it will appeal to our target audience. If the book is well-written and the subject matter is compelling, we'll publish it, regardless of what the critics say. Publisher E Reviews are a nice bonus, but we don't base our decisions solely on them. We look at the author's platform, their social"
C1,"WEATHERVANE MAKER THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham’s designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. The weathervane he is making for the Wiltshire village of Devizes is no exception. Graham carefully measures and draws the outline of the horse, taking great care to ensure that it will be proportionate and balanced once it’s installed on top of the church tower. He cuts out the outline of the horse from a sheet of copper, carefully folding and bending it to create the desired shape. Next, he adds the details, carefully crafting the eyes, nostrils, and mane to give the horse a lifelike appearance. The copper is then polished to a high shine, ready for installation. Graham has been making weathervanes for over 20 years, and he takes great pride in his work. He knows that his weathervanes will be a lasting tribute to the craftsmanship of the past, while also providing a functional and beautiful addition to the Devizes church tower.
GRAHAM SMITH’S WORKSHOP is a hive of activity, filled with the sound of hammering, sawing, and polishing. The smell of copper fills the air, and the light from the windows highlights the intricate details of the weathervanes in various stages of completion. Graham is a master craftsman, with a keen eye for detail and a deep appreciation for the history and tradition of his craft. He learned his skills from his"
C1,"But he most regretted his denials that the industry aimed its advertising at teenagers. ""We spent millions studying kids. We knew that they could name the three most advertised brands of cigarettes. We knew that almost 90 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands. And we didn't care.""

He also regretted the company's use of surrogate advertising, which involved paying doctors to promote cigarettes on television and radio. ""We created a whole new field of medicine called 'tobacco therapy,'"" he said. ""We paid doctors to say that smoking was good for your health.""

Mr. Hill's words were a stark contrast to the industry's current stance on advertising to minors. The tobacco industry has long maintained that it does not target its advertising at children and teenagers, and that it is committed to following all laws and regulations regarding advertising to minors.

But Mr. Hill's testimony raises questions about the industry's sincerity in this regard. If the industry knew that its advertising was effective at convincing young people to smoke, and if it spent millions of dollars studying children's preferences and behavior, then why did it continue to advertise so aggressively to teenagers?

The answer, of course, is that the industry was driven by a desire to increase sales and profits, regardless of the health consequences for its customers. And as long as the industry continues to prioritize these goals over the health and well-being of its customers, then it is unlikely to change its advertising practices in any meaningful way.

When I arrived at Mr Jaggers's office the clerk told me that he was in court and that he had left word I should wait in his room. He led me to a dark room. It was a large chamber with a table and several chairs, a fire burning in the grate, and a few books on a shelf.

I waited there for about an hour, when the door opened and Mr Jaggers entered. He was a tall, thin man, with a sallow complexion and a long white beard. He nodded to me and motioned me to a chair.

""So you are the young man who has come to see me about your father's affairs,"" he said in a deep, measured voice. ""I am glad to make your acquaintance, and I will do my best to assist you.""

He sat down and leaned back in his chair, looking at me with a piercing gaze.

I took a deep breath and began to tell him everything I knew, from the little that my mother had told me about my father's career as a lawyer, to the discovery of the will and the mystery surrounding it.

C1,"The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar one of Britain's top 10000-metre runners visits the Kenyans’ high-altitude training camp. Ten miles south of the equator a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. As the road dips and rises through the foothills the track becomes a series of zigzagging switchbacks that gouge their way through the volcanic rock. The air grows thinner and the winds gust upwards and sideways. The track becomes a rocky traverse across the mountain face and then a series of steep stone stairs that hewn out of the rock. The stairs are worn smooth by the feet of generations of porters and runners. The summit is a flat rocky platform that rises like a shelf above the surrounding landscape. On a clear day the view stretches out across the Rift Valley to the snow-capped peaks of Mount Elbrus in the distance.
The camp is a series of tents clustered around a central mess tent. The runners are gathered around a fire drinking tea and swapping stories of their training runs. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly with a hint of competitiveness that simmers beneath the surface. Nerurkar joins the group and listens intently to their stories of training in the high altitude. He is struck by the contrast between the rugged beauty of the mountain landscape and the stark poverty of the local people who live in the surrounding valleys. As the sun sets the runners retire to their tents for a well-deserved rest before the next day's training. The"

This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. But what of the dreamboat? The boat that makes you feel like you are living the dream? For me, the answer is 'The Westerman'. This boat is a new creation, but it is based on an old hull shape. It is a boat that combines the best of both worlds. The hull shape is a classic West Country pilchard fishing boat, but the interior is modern and comfortable. The boat is 30ft long, with a beam of 10ft, and a draught of 4ft. She is powered by a 115hp diesel engine, which gives her a cruising speed of 8 knots. The boat has a long, pointed bow, which allows her to cut through the water with ease. The side decks are wide and uncluttered, giving plenty of room to move around. The interior is spacious and well-lit, with a large saloon area that can seat six people comfortably. The cabin is well-insulated, and there is a good-sized chart table aft. The boat has a large, open cockpit, which can be enclosed with screens if required. The boat's interior is modern and comfortable, with a well-equipped galley, and a large double berth in the cabin.

C1,Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards. This is a defense mechanism that protects them from predators. Hedgehogs are nocturnal animals and spend most of their time foraging for food. They are insectivores and feed on a variety of insects and small invertebrates. Hedgehogs are solitary animals and only come together to mate. After mating the female will give birth to 2-5 blind and hairless young which she will care for alone. Hedgehogs are vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting and are often persecuted by farmers who see them as pests. However many people keep hedgehogs as pets and there are also conservation efforts in place to protect these fascinating creatures. Interesting facts about hedgehogs: Hedgehogs have poor eyesight but have an excellent sense of smell. They have a unique way of eating which involves using their snout to move food around their mouths. Hedgehogs can also swim and are known to swim long distances to find food or shelter. Hedgehogs have been known to hibernate during the winter months but not all species do. The African hedgehog is the largest species of hedgehog and can weigh up to 3.5kg. The Indian hedgehog is the smallest species and can weigh as little as 25g. Hedgehogs have been known to use tools to obtain
C1,"Blacksmiths THROUGHOUT the ages iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers because they were the sole providers of weapons armour and farming tools. The blacksmith was a man of mystery and power who worked with the very stuff of life itself.

Blacksmithing has a long and rich history that stretches back thousands of years. The earliest known blacksmiths were the ancient Egyptians who used copper and bronze to create tools and weapons around 3000 BCE. Over the centuries the art of blacksmithing spread to other cultures and regions including ancient Greece and Rome the medieval Islamic world and Europe during the Middle Ages.

During the Industrial Revolution the rise of factories and mass production led to a decline in the demand for blacksmiths. Many of the traditional skills and techniques of the craft were lost as modern manufacturing methods became more prevalent. However in recent years there has been a renewed interest in traditional blacksmithing and the craft is once again gaining recognition and respect.

Today blacksmiths continue to create beautiful and functional works of art using a variety of techniques and tools. They work with a range of metals including steel iron and bronze to create items such as sculptures jewelry tools and architectural features. The craft of blacksmithing remains an important part of many cultures and continues to inspire and fascinate people around the world.

C1,"The Tartan Museum The modern cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened. You cannot miss it. The Tartan Museum, a modern, angular building, stands out among the historic architecture of Edinburgh's Old Town. The cheese-wedge shape of the building, with its sloping roof and cantilevered floors, gives the impression of a futuristic spacecraft. But inside, the museum's focus on Scotland's rich cultural heritage is anything but alien. The museum's entrance hall is dominated by a stunning staircase, which winds upwards like a ribbon. The walls are adorned with tartan, the traditional plaid patterns associated with Scotland, in every shade and hue. The museum's collection spans 1,000 years of Scottish history, from ancient artifacts to contemporary art. Highlights include the 16th-century Book of Deer, illuminated with intricate drawings of animals and plants; and the 18th-century Achenwall Harp, one of only two surviving examples of its kind. The museum also explores Scotland's cultural impact on the world, showcasing everything from traditional music and dance to the famous Scottish Enlightenment thinkers like David Hume and Adam Smith.

C1,"In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr Toby Clark a researcher at the British Geological Survey aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. But in his younger years, he was also a skilled navigator and mathematician, and he made a groundbreaking contribution to navigation: charting compass variations. Halley's work was instrumental in understanding the Earth's magnetic field and its effect on compass readings. Now, more than 300 years after Halley's death, researcher Toby Clark is on a quest to retrace Halley's steps. Clark, a geophysicist at the British Geological Survey, has been studying compass variations for years. He's interested in understanding how the Earth's magnetic field has changed over time and how that affects navigation. Clark's journey began in 1678, when Halley set out on a voyage to the South Atlantic to measure the Earth's magnetic field. Halley was part of a team of astronomers and navigators who were trying to solve the problem of compass variations. At the time, navigators were having trouble using compasses to find their way because the needle was not always pointing north. Halley realized that the Earth's magnetic field was causing the variations, and he developed a theory to explain how it worked. He used his observations of the Earth's magnetic field to create a map of the field, which is still used today. Clark is now trying to recreate Halley's journey and measurements. He's using the same"

C1,"Photographing People People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations the photographer has to be conscious of actions gestures and expressions. The face is the most important part of the body for conveying emotion and character. A good portrait photographer has to be able to capture the personality of the subject. A person's face is like a landscape and a skilled photographer can use light shadows and color to reveal its features. 

The photographer must also be able to anticipate and capture the subject's expressions and actions. These can be fleeting and unpredictable and the photographer must be quick and alert to catch them. The photographer must also be able to create a rapport with the subject and make them feel comfortable in front of the camera. This can be difficult especially with strangers or difficult personalities. 

The photographer must also be able to direct the subject and help them to pose in a way that is natural and flattering. This can involve subtle manipulation of the subject's body language and facial expressions. A good portrait photographer must also be able to see beyond the surface of the subject and capture their essence and character. This can involve using light and shadow to create a sense of depth and dimension and by using the background and surroundings to create a sense of context and atmosphere.

The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. But Sue knows. And so do we. For a moment, she hesitates, eyeing the phone receiver as if it might burst into flames. Then, with a resigned sigh, she picks up the receiver, her voice crisp and businesslike. ""Good afternoon, Globe Hotel. How can I assist you?"" ""Hello,"" says the voice on the other end of the line, ""I'm interested in booking a room for tonight."" ""Of course,"" says Sue, playing along. ""Can I have your name, please?"" ""Sue Brown,"" says the voice. Sue's eyes widen fractionally, but she keeps her cool. ""I see,"" she says. ""And what is your confirmation number?"" ""I'm afraid I don't have one,"" admits the voice. ""Oh dear,"" says Sue, trying to keep the disappointment out of her voice. ""I'm afraid we can't proceed with the booking without a confirmation number."" ""Oh, right,"" says the voice. ""Sorry about that."" ""Not to worry,"" says Sue, forcing a smile onto her face.

C1,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support If you applied for a job in some countries you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting as much as anything else that would determine your suitability for the job. In many countries, handwriting is still seen as a reliable indicator of a person’s character, intelligence and even their personality traits.
It’s an ancient practice, dating back to the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans, who believed that the way a person wrote could reveal their innermost thoughts and feelings. And it’s still going strong today, with many psychologists and career counselors using handwriting analysis as a tool to assess personality traits and predict job performance.
The idea is that the way a person writes reveals their level of confidence, their emotional stability, their creativity and their attention to detail.
It may sound like a bit of a mystery, but there are actually some well-established principles that underlie handwriting analysis. For example, research has shown that people with more rounded letters and more space between words tend to be more creative and open to new ideas. On the other hand, those with more angular letters and less space between words tend to be more detail-oriented and organized.
And it’s not just a matter of aesthetics. Studies have also shown that the way a person writes can reveal their level of stress and anxiety. For example, people who have a tendency to write in a more angular and tense style may be more prone to stress and anxiety.
It’s not just for job applicants either"
C1,"Volunteer tourism Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. A. It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. B. The motivations of the volunteers are often not altruistic but driven by personal gain. C. Volunteer tourism can have positive effects on the local economy and communities. D. Volunteer tourism can also have negative impacts on the local culture and environment.

A. It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly.

According to the writer, the actual contribution of volunteer tourism to development is questionable. This is because the work that volunteers do is often not sustainable and may not have a lasting impact on the local community. Additionally, the writer suggests that the work that volunteers do may be replaced by local workers once the volunteer leaves, which would limit the long-term benefits of the work.

B. The motivations of the volunteers are often not altruistic but driven by personal gain.

The writer suggests that many volunteers are not motivated by a desire to help the local community, but rather by personal gain. This could include gaining work experience, improving their resume, or simply having a fun and adventurous experience. While these motivations are not necessarily bad, the writer argues that they undermine the idea that volunteer tourism is truly about helping the local community.

C. Volunteer tourism can have positive effects on the local economy and communities.

The University Museum of Classical Archaeology The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But the replicas are so lifelike that it is easy to forget that they are not the original works. The casts are arranged chronologically from the Archaic period to the Roman Empire and include famous works such as the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. B.

C1,"Are you too nice for your own good? When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity. 'I'm so sorry' I beamed when I dropped the plate on the floor and it smashed into smithereens. 'No worries at all, it's completely fine, really!' I gushed when a customer sent their steak back because it was too well done. 'It's no trouble at all, I'll just get that for you right away!' I trilled when a customer asked for a refill on their drink.

At first, the customers were taken aback by my over-the-top friendliness. But soon they started to warm to me, and I found myself getting better tips and more generous gratuities as a result. So I kept on smiling and being nice, even when I was feeling stressed or overwhelmed. And it worked – I got great reviews from customers and my bosses were happy with my work.

But there were times when I wondered if being too nice was holding me back. I wanted to be able to stand up for myself and say no when I needed to, but I found it hard to do so without feeling like I was being rude or unfriendly. I knew I needed to find a balance between being nice and being assertive, but I wasn't sure how to do it.

Do you think being too nice is holding you back in any way? If so, how can you find a balance between being friendly and assertive? Let me know in the comments!

The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964 a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. But as they climbed to 30,000 feet and the aircraft leveled out, something strange happened. The students in the back of the plane suddenly felt as though they were floating. The aircraft was in a state of weightlessness, and the students were experiencing the thrill of zero gravity. For 25 years, the National Space Foundation has been offering flights aboard the ""Weightless Wonder,"" a specially modified Boeing KC-135 tanker that can create a weightless environment for scientists, engineers, and students. The aircraft flies in a parabolic arc, creating periods of weightlessness that last from 20 to 30 seconds at a time. During these brief periods, the students can conduct experiments, test theories, and even play games in a weightless environment. ""It's like being in a dream world,"" said Mandy Hodges, a student from the University of Texas at Austin. ""It's hard to believe that you're actually floating in mid-air."" The students on board the flight were taking part in a program run by the National Space Foundation, which offers flights aboard the Weightless Wonder to students and teachers from around the country. The program is designed to give students hands-on experience in conducting experiments in microgravity, and to inspire them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and"

Even seen at a distance eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an I8-year-old student filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. My companions were a group of artists and writers mostly from London. One of them was a painter called David. David was a bit older than the rest of us and had a reputation for being a bit of a wild card. He had been on a boat trip with Picasso in the Mediterranean a few years before and had even been invited to stay with the artist in Paris. David was a tall dark-haired man with a mischievous grin and a habit of talking in a slightly exaggerated way. 'I'm telling you, Richard,' he said as we sat at a table on the harbour front in Cannes, 'Picasso is a bloody genius. He's the only person I've ever met who can make you feel like you're completely insignificant and yet at the same time make you feel like you're the most important person in the world.' 'That's a bit weird,' I said, not quite sure I believed him. 'But what do you mean?' 'Well,' David said, 'you know how Picasso's paintings are all so abstract and expressionist? Well, it's not just because he's trying to create some kind of artistic effect. It's because he's actually trying to get inside the mind of the subject. He wants to understand what makes them tick, what makes them so bloody interesting.' 'So he's"
C1,"Hit and miss of mass marketing AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. In the past, advertising was the key to success. It was a way of getting the word out about new products and services. But today, the world has moved on. Customers are bombarded with messages from all directions. They are hard to reach and harder to convince. Advertising is no longer the magic bullet it once was. There are other ways of reaching customers. For example, they can use the Internet to find out about products and services. They can also use their friends and family to spread the word. In short, advertising is no longer the only game in town. In fact, it may not even be the best game in town. So what's the answer? Some say that advertising needs to change. It needs to become more targeted and more personal. It needs to use new media and new techniques. But others say that advertising is doomed. They say that the age of mass marketing is over. The future belongs to niche marketing. The truth is probably somewhere in between. Advertising will continue to play an important role. But it will have to adapt to the changing times. It will have to be more selective and more personal. It will have to use new media and new techniques. And it will have to work harder to get its message across. The bottom line is that advertising is not dead. But it is changing. And it has to change to stay relevant.

I was a journalist, but after 20 years of working in the industry, I took a break. I was burnt out, and I needed some time to recharge. I didn't realize it at the time, but that break would turn out to be a transformative period in my life.
During my career break, I had a lot of time to think about what I wanted to do next. I had always been interested in technology, and I began to explore the possibilities of working remotely. I wanted to find a way to work from home, but I didn't know where to start.
That's when I met my husband, John. He was an IT consultant, and he had been working remotely for years. He showed me the ropes, and I was amazed at how easy it was to set up a home office. We worked together to transform our family home into a functional and efficient workspace.

C1,"POWER DRESSING EVERY SUMMER the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance?

The peacocks are resplendent in their shimmering blues and greens, their train like a vast banner unfurled in defiance of the laws of evolution. For what purpose do these birds display such a spectacle of beauty? Is it to attract a mate, or to intimidate rivals? Or is it simply because they can, because nature has given them the gift of such dazzling plumage?

As the peacocks strut and preen, their trains swaying in the breeze like a great sea anemone, one cannot help but be struck by the sheer exuberance of life. For in this place where animals roam free, unencumbered by the constraints of society, they are able to express themselves in ways that are denied to us. They are the true aristocrats of the animal kingdom, unashamed of their beauty and their extravagance.

And so, as the summer sun beats down on the park, the peacocks continue to display their magnificent trains, a testament to the enduring power of nature to inspire and delight. For in their beauty, we see a reflection of our own desires and aspirations, a reminder that even in the most mundane of lives, there is always the possibility of transcendence and joy.

C1,"NATURAL TALENTS In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees we haven’t had time to develop any differences: genetically we’re still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps. On this grand evolutionary scale whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development.

What are some of the natural talents that humans possess?

Humans are incredibly adept at using tools. From the first crude stone hammers to the sophisticated gadgets that we use today we’ve been able to harness the power of technology to shape our environment and improve our lives.

Humans have an incredible capacity for language. The ability to communicate through language is so fundamental to our survival and success that it’s hard to imagine how we could have evolved without it.

Humans are also highly social creatures. We have an innate desire to connect with others and form communities. This has driven the development of complex social structures and cultures that allow us to cooperate and work together to achieve common goals.

In addition humans have an uncanny ability to create and appreciate art. From the earliest cave paintings to the most sophisticated digital installations we have a deep-seated need to express ourselves creatively and to connect with others through beauty and emotion.

Finally humans have a remarkable capacity for learning and adaptability. We are able to learn new skills and absorb new information rapidly and with remarkable ease. This has allowed us to survive and thrive in a wide range of environments and to adapt to changing circumstances in ways that other species cannot.

Overall it’s clear that humans possess a range"

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.
In the late 19th century, the first gum base was created by a man named Thomas Adams. He was inspired by the resin of the Mexican slippery elm tree, which was chewed by Native Americans to soothe their throats. Adams mixed the resin with chicle, a natural latex derived from the sapodilla tree, and created the first chewing gum. It was called Chicza, and it was marketed as a health tonic.
In the early 20th century, the mass production of chewing gum became possible, thanks to the invention of the Blibber-Blather machine. This machine was capable of producing 100 sticks of gum per minute, making it possible to meet the growing demand for chewing gum.
In the 1920s and 1930s, chewing gum became a cultural phenomenon, with new flavors and textures being introduced and chewing gum being used as a fashion accessory. It was also marketed as a way to freshen breath and improve digestion.
Today, there are over 200 brands of chewing gum available, and it is estimated that Americans chew over 12 million sticks of gum per day. Chewing gum is big business, with annual sales of over $2 billion.

A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph The first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer and aspiring director. His marriage had broken up and he had lost his job on a TV series. He was struggling to come to terms with these setbacks when he began writing a book in the evenings after work. It was a story about a young girl who was savagely injured in a horse riding accident and the horse whisperer who helped her recover. The book took him three months to write and when he finished he had no idea whether it would be any good. But he knew he had to try. He sent the manuscript to a few agents and was amazed when one of them offered him a two-book deal. The Horse Whisperer was published in September 1994 and it has been a runaway success. The book has sold more than one million copies in hardback in the US alone and has been translated into 17 languages. The film rights have been sold to Paramount Pictures for an undisclosed sum and a Hollywood adaptation is currently in production. Evans is now in the enviable position of being able to choose which projects he wants to work on next. He is currently writing a second novel and has been approached by several production companies to develop TV shows. What was the inspiration behind The Horse Whisperer?

C1,"THEATRE CHARLES SPENCER A. Tamburlaine the Great Marlowe’s ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands’ staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe’s play with an exhilarating speed and physicality. The action is concentrated into just three hours, with an interval that feels all too short.
It is not just the length of the play that is remarkable, but the way in which Hands has harnessed the power of his excellent cast to convey the sheer force of Tamburlaine’s personality. With a handful of actors, he creates a sense of vast armies and sweeping landscapes, with each actor playing multiple roles. The result is a production that is both intimate and epic, with a sense of theatrical magic that is hard to resist.
Tamburlaine himself is played by the commanding David Tennant, who conveys the warrior’s wit, intelligence and ruthless ambition with a compelling intensity. He is a man driven by a vision of his own greatness, and Tennant makes him both fascinating and terrifying.
The production is not without its flaws. At times the pace can feel a little frenetic, and there are moments when the acting feels a little over-stylized. But these are minor quibbles in the face of such an exhilarating and unforgettable evening.
This is a Tamburlaine for the modern age, a production that combines the power of Marlowe’s words with the excitement of contemporary theatre. It is a must-see for anyone who lov"

But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless that is it is newspapers’ ‘transition’ to the online world an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process – because frankly it may not be a process at all. Print is still here and still selling well, and the web is not a zero-sum game. In fact the two worlds are merging, inevitably and increasingly. The difference is that the old world will shrink, and the new world will grow. And the shrinkage will be a lot faster than you think. The first sign of this is the way that big newspapers are cutting back on their print editions. The New York Times, for example, has cut back from seven days a week to five. The Times of London is cutting back from 17 to 11. And the Financial Times is going to a five-day week. The reasons are the same as they were a decade ago. The money isn’t there. Or it’s not there any more. Newspapers are finding that they can’t make enough money from their print editions to justify the cost of printing and distributing them. So they are cutting back. And as they do, they are shifting their resources to the web. The web is where the money is – or at least it’s where the money is going to be. And newspapers are adjusting their business models accordingly. Some are putting their content online for free, and making money from advertising.

Southwell Minster, a 13th-century cathedral in Nottinghamshire, is home to some of the most intricate and beautiful medieval stonework in Britain. But tucked away in a quiet corner of the building, there are also some surprising – and little-known – pagan symbols.
These ‘green’ men, as they are known, are depicted as bearded figures with leaves for heads. They can be found in the chapter house, a small room off the cathedral’s main nave, where monks would gather for meetings and discussions.
The green men are believed to have been carved by medieval craftsmen as a way of bringing a touch of nature into the stonework. They are thought to represent the connection between the natural world and the spiritual realm, and are a reminder that even in the most sacred of spaces, there is always room for a little bit of earthy magic.
The green men of Southwell Minster are just one of the many surprises that await visitors to this remarkable building. From its stunning stained glass windows to its intricately carved stonework, every inch of Southwell Minster is a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of medieval artisans.

C1,"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West? Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism massage diet manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions but acupuncture’s role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West.

The use of acupuncture in the West has a long history dating back to the 18th century when it was first introduced by French travelers to China. However it wasn’t until the 1950s that acupuncture began to gain popularity in the West as a form of alternative medicine. The World Health Organization recognized acupuncture as a legitimate form of medicine in 1972 and since then it has become increasingly accepted by the medical community in the West.

Acupuncture is based on the idea that the body has a network of energy pathways or meridians through which the life force or chi flows. Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points along these meridians to restore balance to the flow of chi and promote healing. The needles are usually made of metal or plastic and are inserted to a depth of just over one millimeter.

There are many different styles of acupuncture and different practitioners may use different techniques. Some may use a more traditional approach that involves the use of a small handheld device to insert the needles while others may use a more modern approach that involves the use of electronic stimulation.

While the exact mechanism of how acupuncture works is not fully understood there is evidence to suggest that it can have a positive effect on the body’s physi"

C1,"A. 'I actually look rather good in jeans. So I rarely wear them. I don't want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.’ So runs the logic of Isabel 'our heroine’ in this refreshingly zany novel. An art student of 31 devotee of historical romances she seeks Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances. And so she eschews denim in favor of flouncy skirts and dresses. But as she navigates the dating scene with the help of her best friend and confidant, Jess (who is convinced that Isabel's ideal man will turn out to be a bearded hippie), we are treated to a series of hilarious misunderstandings and romantic near misses. Along the way, Isabel must confront the fact that she may be using her clothing as a form of armor to protect herself from the world, and that perhaps the right man will appreciate her for who she is, knobbly knees and all.

A young woman named Isabel is the protagonist of this amusing novel. She is an art student in her mid-30s who is a fan of historical romance novels. She is looking for Mr. Right but is worried that her ""knobbly knees"" will stand in the way of finding him. Rather than wearing jeans, which she believes might lead to her being mistaken for the ""wrong sort of person,"" she prefers to dress in flouncy skirts and dresses.

C1,"Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. Here are three theories: 1. Restoration theory: According to this theory, sleep is necessary for the brain to repair and regenerate itself. The brain is a highly active organ, using up to 20% of the body's energy expenditure at rest. It is thought that during sleep, the brain takes this opportunity to repair and rebuild itself. This theory is supported by studies showing that brain tissue is reorganized during sleep, and that sleep deprivation can lead to cognitive impairment. 2. Energy conservation theory: According to this theory, sleep is a way for the body to conserve energy. When we are awake, our bodies use energy to maintain vital functions such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestion. Sleep allows the body to conserve energy by reducing these functions to a minimum. This theory is supported by studies showing that the body's energy expenditure decreases during sleep. 3. Adaptive theory: According to this theory, sleep is necessary for the body to adapt to its environment. During sleep, the body processes and consolidates memories, and it is thought that this process helps the body to learn and adapt to new situations. This theory is supported by studies showing that sleep plays a role in the formation of long-term memories. In conclusion, the exact function of sleep remains unknown, but these three theories offer some insight into why we spend so"
C1,"Is your office working ok? Fresh air and the right chairs are the key to a happy healthy workforce according to a new survey. We went to four contrasting offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist who studies people’s working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. They told us that the design of an office can have a significant impact on the wellbeing of its employees.
The first office we visited was a modern open plan space with high ceilings and large windows. The survey found that employees reported high levels of stress and discomfort due to noise and lack of privacy. Our expert panel agreed that this was due to the lack of physical boundaries and the inability to control the work environment. The second office was a smaller more traditional space with low ceilings and few windows. While employees here reported lower levels of stress, our panel found that the lack of natural light and poor ergonomics were causing discomfort and eye strain.
The third office was a converted warehouse with high ceilings and exposed brick walls. Employees here reported higher levels of satisfaction and engagement, with our panel attributing this to the abundance of natural light and the variety of workspaces. The final office was a small startup with a relaxed and informal atmosphere. Employees here reported low levels of stress and high levels of job satisfaction, with our panel attributing this to the relaxed and flexible work environment.
In conclusion, our survey found that the design of an office can have a significant impact on the wellbeing of its employees. Employers should consider factors such as air quality, lighting, ergonomics, and workspace design to create a healthy and happy"

C1,"THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING I thought everyone would be pleased but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. ‘What do you mean?’ she raged. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day life-long smoker and four hours later I was not was faintly irritating. But I didn’t have an answer. I did it because I wanted to. It was a selfish decision. 

It was a few years ago. I was in my mid-fifties, a time when most people start to think about the things they want to do before they die. I’d always been a smoker, started when I was 15, like most people. I never really thought about it, it was just something I did. But as I got older I started to think about how much I smoked. It wasn’t something I enjoyed, it was something I did out of habit. And I started to wonder why I was doing it. I had a few attempts to stop, but they were all pretty half-hearted. I’d last a few days, then I’d give in to the cravings. But this time was different. I was determined to stop. And I did.

It wasn’t easy. The first few days were tough, I had headaches and irritability, and I missed the social aspect of smoking. But I persevered. I found other things to do with my hands, like drumming on my desk or fidgeting with a pen. And I distracted myself with other activities, like reading or watching TV. And as the days passed, it got easier. The cravings lessened and I started to feel"
C2,"Writing by hand and on screen Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over. How did we manage to write so much more fluently by hand? 

One reason is the speed. With a pen, you can write faster than you can type, especially if you are not looking at the keyboard. This is because you can see the words as you write them, whereas with typing you are looking at the screen and correcting mistakes as you go along. 

Another reason is the tactile nature of handwriting. When you write by hand, you are engaging your muscles and your senses in a way that is not possible with typing. You can feel the pen moving across the page, the ink flowing, and the weight of the pen in your hand. This physicality of handwriting can help you to focus and to get into a flow state, where the words flow more easily. 

Finally, there is the issue of style. When you write by hand, you can add flourishes and embellishments that are harder to achieve on a keyboard. You can make your writing more expressive and personal, which can help to convey your ideas more effectively. 

In conclusion, while typing has become the dominant form of writing in the digital age, there are still many advantages to writing by hand. Whether it is the speed, the tactile nature of the activity, or the ability to add flourishes and embellishments, handwriting can help you to write more fluently and"
C2,"Philadelphia Avenue I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened the humidity thickened into a palpable prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. The street was narrow and the buildings tall, casting long shadows that stretched across the sidewalk like protective arms. I passed by a small park with a playground and a group of kids laughing and shouting as they chased each other around. A man on a bench watched them with a smile, his eyes crinkled at the corners as he listened to their joyful cries. I continued on, the sound of their laughter fading into the distance as I turned onto the next block. The houses here were a mix of old and new, some with ornate facades and others with plain, unadorned walls. I passed by a few with their windows open, the soft glow of lamps and televisions casting a warm yellow light into the darkness. As I walked, I felt a sense of comfort and security wash over me. This was a neighborhood where people took pride in their homes and their community, where they looked out for each other and welcomed strangers with open arms. I quickened my pace, eager to reach my destination and be a part of this warm and welcoming world.

As I walked, I noticed a particular house that caught my eye. It was a small, unassuming bungalow with a neatly manicured lawn and a few potted plants on the porch. The paint was a soft, muted green and the windows were adorned"
C2,"Einstein Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist and the chances are they’ll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias. He is the face of science. But what do we really know about him? Here are some interesting facts about the man behind the image:
1. Einstein was a bit of a rebel. He never finished school and his parents were disappointed in his lack of academic success. He was actually a bit of a troublemaker and was expelled from school for misbehaving.
2. Einstein was fascinated by the violin and music. He played the violin as a child and even considered becoming a professional musician.
3. Einstein had a unique way of thinking. He was known for his ability to think outside the box and come up with unconventional solutions to problems. He called this way of thinking “thinking with his imagination rather than his intelligence.”
4. Einstein was a bit of a loner. He preferred to work alone and was often criticized for being distant and aloof. He was also known to be quite stubborn and would often refuse to budge on his ideas.
5. Einstein’s most famous equation, E=mc², is often misunderstood. Many people think it means energy equals mass times the speed of light squared, but in reality it means energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared.

C2,"Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. The number of good books has increased enormously. There are many good journals and magazines, and the whole field has become more accessible to the amateur astronomer. In fact, the field has become so accessible that the amateur astronomer is no longer regarded as a curiosity, but as a valuable contributor to the scientific understanding of the universe.

In the past, amateur astronomers were few and far between, and they were often regarded with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion by professional astronomers. However, as the field has become more accessible, the amateur astronomer has become a valuable contributor to the scientific understanding of the universe. Today, there are many amateur astronomers who are actively involved in research and discovery, and their contributions are recognized and valued by the professional astronomy community.

The advent of the internet and other digital technologies has also made it easier for amateur astronomers to connect with each other and share information and resources. This has led to the creation of a thriving community of amateur astronomers, who are able to collaborate and learn from each other in ways that were not possible in the past.

In addition, the development of small, portable telescopes and other equipment has made it possible for amateur astronomers to observe and study the night sky from almost any location on Earth. This has opened up new opportunities for amateur astronomers to explore the universe and make new discoveries.

C2,"Art In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique revolutionary shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago. But in fact the history of art is full of artists who were not rebels. Many artists have worked steadily in the mainstream of their time. Leonardo da Vinci is the obvious example. He was an artist who was not a rebel. He was a supremely skilled artist who worked within the conventions of his time. He made beautiful paintings and drawings of the kind that his contemporaries admired. He also made machines and designs that were practical and useful. He was not a rebel. He was a craftsman who worked in a traditional medium and was good at it. And yet he is now considered one of the greatest painters of all time.

C2,"Fashion Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point. Yet there are many earlier examples of fashion. For instance, the ancient Greeks and Romans were concerned with fashion and style, and the dress of the ancient world has left a lasting legacy in Western dress. The Japanese also have a long history of fashion and style, and the kimono is still an important part of Japanese dress today. In this essay I will discuss the origins of fashion and how it has developed over time. I will argue that fashion has a long history, and that it has been influenced by a variety of social, economic, and cultural factors. I will also examine the relationship between fashion and identity, and suggest that fashion has played a significant role in shaping individual and collective identities throughout history. Fashion has a long history that predates the development of capitalism and the rise of the market economy. The ancient Greeks and Romans were concerned with fashion and style, and the dress of the ancient world has left a lasting legacy in Western dress. For instance, the Greeks favored a simple, flowing style of dress, while the Romans preferred a more ornate and elaborate style. In the Middle Ages, the dress of the nobility and the clergy was highly ornate and elaborate, with intricate embroidery and jewels being used to display wealth and status. The Renaissance saw a renewed interest in classical styles of dress, with a focus on proportion and balance. During the Enlighten"
C2,"Metals It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. He might have wondered at its smoothness and brightness and decided to keep it for himself. He might have taken it home and examined it more closely and discovered that it was not a pebble at all but a piece of metal. The possibilities of this new material would have been endless. It could be hammered into shape to make tools, or shaped into decorative objects. It could be alloyed with other metals to create new colors and textures. It could even be melted down and re-molded into something entirely new. The discovery of metal was a major turning point in human history. It marked the beginning of the end of the Stone Age and the beginning of the Bronze Age. It opened up new possibilities for art and industry and allowed people to create things that had never been seen before. The earliest known metal artifacts date back to around 6000 BC, although it is likely that people had discovered metal long before this. The first metal to be used by humans was probably copper, which is a soft and malleable metal that can be easily shaped into various forms. Copper was widely available in many parts of the world and was likely discovered by early humans as they explored their surroundings. Over time, people began to experiment with combining copper with other metals to create new alloys. One of the earliest known copper-based alloys is bronze, which was"
C2,"The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. I had been in Vienna for three days and had already taken more than a thousand photographs. I was on my fourth roll of film and was starting to feel the strain of carrying too much equipment. I had been to the Naschmarkt, the Prater, the Schönbrunn Palace, and the city center. I had photographed cafés, street performers, and horse-drawn carriages. I had even taken a few shots of the Mozart House, just because it was there. But I was on a mission. I had been hired by a magazine to take photographs of the city’s street life for an upcoming issue. It was a simple assignment, but one that I took very seriously. I had been given a list of specific locations and times to photograph. I had a small notebook in which I recorded my observations and notes about each location. I was determined to get the best shots possible. As I walked down the street, I noticed a small café tucked away between two larger buildings. The sign above the door read “Café Central.” I had seen it before, but I had never stopped to photograph it. Something about it caught my eye now. I took a few steps closer and noticed that the café was bustling with activity. Customers were sipping coffee and chatting, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air. I took out my camera and"
C2,"Enough Sleep? Tiredness it is often claimed has become the modern condition. As the richer busier countries have grown so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings. Tiredness, then, is a widespread and pressing problem, one that is often associated with a breakdown in social relations and an inability to function in everyday life.

The causes of tiredness are many and varied, ranging from the physical to the psychological and social. Among the physical causes are a poor diet, lack of exercise, and poor sleep hygiene. Psychological factors include stress, anxiety, and depression, while social factors include the demands of work, family, and social life, as well as the pressure to be constantly available and responsive.

Tiredness, then, is not just a personal problem but a societal one, reflecting broader cultural and economic trends. It is a symptom of a society that is increasingly focused on productivity, efficiency, and profit, and that places a high value on work and consumption. Tiredness is a reminder that there are limits to what we can do, limits that are imposed not just by our physical and mental capacities but also by the demands of the social and economic system in which we live.

In this sense, tiredness is a challenge to the dominant ideologies of work and progress, and a reminder that there are other ways of living and being that are more sustainable and more fulfilling. It is a call to rethink the way we organize our lives and our"
C2,"Air-conditioning There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer’s unusually high temperatures the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so in fact that at quiet times the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. “It’s like a freezer in here,” says one member, shivering into his tracksuit top. “I’ve had to bring my gloves and hat to work out in the morning.”
Other members have taken to wearing balaclavas and scarves to protect their necks from the icy blast. “It’s like a winter wonderland in here,” jokes one gym-goer, “but at least we’re getting a good workout in.”
The gym’s management insists that the extreme cooling is necessary to prevent overheating and ensure the safety of members. “We take the health and safety of our members very seriously,” says a spokesperson. “We have to make sure the temperature is comfortable for everyone, especially during the hot summer months.”
However, not everyone is convinced. Some members have complained of feeling “like they’re in a meat freezer” and have even started a petition to have the air-conditioning turned down. “It’s just too cold,” says one member. “I can’t even wear my usual workout gear because it’s too hot to sweat in.”
Despite the complaints the gym’s management remains resolute. “We understand that it might be a bit chilly at times, but we’re willing to make some sacrifices for the safety of our members,”"
C2,"THE WELL I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched eyes wide fist to mouth as I winched up the well bucket steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I could hear you calling up to me as I descended through the darkness 'are you sure you're doing this?'.

I stopped at the bottom of the well and called down to you 'of course I'm sure! I've read that from here I could see the stars if the night were clear'.

You groaned and said 'you're such a weirdo'.

I grinned up at you 'come on down and see for yourself'.

You hesitated then shook your head 'no way, you're on your own for this one'.

I chuckled and climbed back up the well shaking my head at your lack of adventure.

As I climbed back up the well I couldn't help but wonder if I would really be able to see the stars from down there. I had always been fascinated by the night sky and the thought of seeing it from a completely new perspective was incredibly exciting.

When I reached the top of the well I called down to you 'it's clear up there, you should come and see'.

C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day.

He fumbled in his pocket for the switch and turned on the light, which flooded the hall with a pleasant warm glow. As he stood there, he could almost believe that he was returning home to a place he had known and loved all his life, rather than to a small, cramped let in a dingy part of London.

Ralph had always been a bit of a romantic, and the idea of home had always been an important one to him. Even as a child, he had dreamed of having a big house with a garden and a family, and as he grew older, these dreams only grew stronger.

But as he knew all too well, life had other plans. His parents had died when he was young, and he had been forced to fend for himself. He had worked hard and saved every penny he could, until he had finally managed to buy this let.

It was a small, cramped place, but it was his own, and he had done his best to make it feel like home. He had painted the walls a warm, comforting yellow, and had added a few personal touches here and there.

As he stood in the hall, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Despite all his struggles, he had managed to create a little oasis of comfort and security for himself. And as he made his way"
C2,"Heritage The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously we feel connected to our personal heritage usually we know who and what our grandparents were and we will have heard stories about how they lived. But it is more than that. It is also about the collective heritage of a community or a nation. This is the shared history, traditions, beliefs and customs that have been passed down from generation to generation and are still important today.
Heritage is not just about museums and historical buildings. It is about the everyday things that people do and the way they live their lives. For example, it could be the food we eat, the music we listen to, the stories we tell, the way we dress, the way we celebrate holidays and festivals.
Heritage is also about identity. It helps us to understand who we are and where we come from. It gives us a sense of belonging and a connection to the past, present and future. It also helps us to understand the diversity of cultures and communities within a society.
Finally, heritage is about preserving the past for future generations. It is important to protect and conserve our heritage so that it can be enjoyed by our children and grandchildren. This is why it is important to have laws and policies that protect our cultural and natural heritage.
Heritage is important for many reasons. It helps us to understand our identity and our place in the world. It also helps us to appreciate the diversity of cultures and communities within a society. It gives us a sense of connection with the past, present and future. It helps us"
C2,"Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare’s play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. Well, I must eat my words! Fearon is a stunning Othello and his performance is one of the most powerful and moving of his career. He has the dignity and authority of a great actor and he dominates the stage with a quiet intensity that is both mesmerizing and terrifying. He is a true tragic hero, a man of great stature and intelligence who is brought down by his own flaws and the jealousy of his enemies. His love for Desdemona is pure and true and his rage at her supposed infidelity is both understandable and heartbreaking. The supporting cast is equally strong, with a special mention for the superb performance of Sophie Thompson as Desdemona. She brings a gentle grace and beauty to the role and her death scene is one of the most poignant moments in the play. The production is directed by Gregory Dorrill and it is a masterpiece of clarity and simplicity. The set is minimalist and the lighting is atmospheric, but the actors use the space with great skill and the pacing is perfect. The play is performed without intermissions and it runs for three hours, but it is a gripping and unforgettable experience. I am deeply sorry for my previous review and I hope that this one will make amends. Othello is a masterpiece of drama and it is a must-see for anyone who"
C2,"The Wrong Country Uncle chose for them a package holiday at a very reasonable price: a flight from Gatwick Airport twelve nights in Venice the fairyland city in the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went together to the travel agency to make the booking the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast all of them learning Italian.
It was too late to change the arrangements the wrong country uncle said they were paying for the holiday so they would just have to put up with the school group. Keith and Dawne were not pleased.
Keith and Dawne had been saving up for their holiday for a whole year. Keith was a manager in a bank and Dawne worked in a shop. They had been to Italy before but only for a week and they had stayed in a hotel in Rome. They were looking forward to the relaxation of a package holiday in Venice. They had read about the citys beauty and charm in books and magazines. They were eager to see the canals and the bridges and the palaces and the churches.
On the day of their departure Keith and Dawne were up early. They packed their cases and had breakfast. They were both feeling a little anxious about the holiday. They had heard that the school group would be noisy and disruptive. They did not know how they would cope with them.
At Gatwick Airport they joined the queue for check-in. As they waited they heard the sound of children shouting and laughing. They looked at each other nervously. When it was their turn to check-in Keith and Dawne were told that their flight was delayed. They would have to wait for four hours before they could take off.

C2,"Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal.

But the reality of lions hunting is far more complex and nuanced than this popular image might suggest. In the wild lions are far more solitary creatures than their social behavior might lead us to believe. They do not hunt in packs the way wolves do but instead go on the hunt individually or in small groups of related females.

This is because lions have a highly specialized diet that requires them to hunt larger prey than most other big cats. Their preferred prey is large ungulates such as zebras and antelopes which can weigh up to 400 pounds. This means that a single lion cannot bring down such prey on its own and must rely on stealth cunning and timing to outmaneuver its quarry.

In addition to their specialized diet lions also face significant competition for food from other predators in their ecosystem. Hyenas leopards and other predators are always on the lookout for an easy meal and can quickly scavenge a kill from a careless lion. This means that lions must be constantly on the move and always on the lookout for their next meal.

Despite these challenges lions are incredibly successful hunters and their social behavior plays a crucial role in their success. Lions are highly social animals and they work together to protect their territory and"
C2,"Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition.
The mission, which Tito is calling the “Inspiration Mars Mission,” would send a crew of two to Mars in a specially designed capsule, with the goal of returning them safely to Earth after a 501-day journey. The mission would be the longest duration crewed spaceflight ever attempted, and would require the astronauts to endure a variety of challenges, including weightlessness, radiation exposure, and isolation from Earth.
Tito, a 70-year-old entrepreneur and space tourist, has already spent millions of dollars on the development of the mission concept, and is currently seeking additional funding to cover the estimated $1.5 billion cost of the mission. He hopes to launch the mission in 2018, with the crew consisting of a middle-aged married couple who are both physically and emotionally robust.
The ideal candidates for the mission would be a couple in their mid-50s to early 60s, who are in good physical health and have a strong emotional bond. They should also have a strong educational background in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) field, and have experience working in a team environment.
The mission would involve a number of challenges, including the long duration of the flight, the lack of privacy and personal space, and the constant exposure to radiation. The astronauts"
C2,"Garbage in garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be. Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip. In most countries, the amount of rubbish each household produces is determined by the local authority and the rubbish is collected free of charge. However, in a growing number of places, including the United States, Canada and parts of Europe, the charge for rubbish collection is being passed on to the householders themselves. The rationale behind this approach is that by charging people for the disposal of their rubbish, they will be more careful about what they throw away. The idea is that if people have to pay for the privilege of disposing of their rubbish, they will be more mindful of how much they produce in the first place. As a result, they will recycle more, compost more and generally be more environmentally responsible. The approach has its attractions. After all, why should the rest of us have to pay for the disposal of someone else's rubbish? By charging households directly for waste disposal, the costs can be more easily tracked and accounted for, and the incentive to reduce waste is clear. Moreover, the revenue generated from waste disposal fees can be used to fund environmental initiatives, such as recycling programmes and community composting projects. However, there are also several reasons why charging households directly for waste disposal may not be the most effective approach. For a start, it may not be fair to penalise people for producing"
C2,"Goat Racing I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans hordes of people food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. I was determined to capture this unusual event on camera.

As I got closer to the racecourse, I could hear the excited chatter of the crowd. I made my way through the gates and found myself standing on the sidelines of a race that was about to begin. A group of goats were lined up at the starting line, wearing tiny saddle and bridles, looking very dignified and unimpressed. The crowd cheered and shouted as the starter raised the flag, and the goats set off like rockets down the track.

It was a hilarious sight, watching these goats racing around the track, some of them running like hell, while others seemed to be enjoying the ride. One goat in particular stood out, he was a grey and white goat named Max, he was running like a champion, his ears flapping in the wind as he crossed the finish line. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause as Max was declared the winner.

I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all, and I was grateful for the opportunity to capture this unique event on camera. As I packed up my gear and made my way back through the crowds, I couldn't help but think about the next time I would return to Buccoo Village for another round of goat racing.

C2,"0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other.

The interviewee may be influenced by their own experiences, emotions, and motivations, while the interviewer brings their own biases and assumptions to the conversation. This is why historians need to be vigilant in their use of oral evidence, carefully evaluating the reliability and credibility of each source.

One way to do this is through corroboration, where the oral testimony of one witness is cross-checked against other sources of evidence, such as written records or physical artifacts. Another approach is to use multiple interviewers, each with their own distinct perspective and expertise, to provide a more comprehensive view of the past.

Ultimately, the use of oral evidence in historical research requires a nuanced and contextual understanding of the social and cultural context in which the testimony was given. By taking this approach, historians can build a more complete and accurate picture of the past, one that takes into account the diverse perspectives and experiences of those who lived through it.

The use of oral evidence in historical research is a growing trend, but it is not without its challenges. One of the main problems is that oral testimony can be unreliable and subjective, as each witness brings their own biases and motivations to the interview. Historians must be vigilant in evaluating the reliability of each source, using techniques such as corro"
C2,"'You don't take sugar do you? shouted his secretary not so much asking a question as stating a fact - as well she might because she had been making Lancelot cups of coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting such things was that he wasn’t normally supposed to be there.

The detective had been called to the office that morning to investigate a minor burglary. He had been told that Lancelot had been seen lurking around the building late at night, and that a number of small items had gone missing from the office. The detective had been instructed to find out who this Lancelot person was, and to bring him in for questioning.

As he sat at his desk, sipping his coffee and going through the files, the detective couldn’t help but notice the strange looks he was getting from the secretary. She seemed to be watching him suspiciously, and he wondered if she might be hiding something.

""So, Mrs... uh, what was your name again?"" he asked, trying to sound casual.

""Mrs. Jenkins,"" she replied, her voice low and measured. ""And no, I don't take sugar. I'm afraid I'm not very good at making small talk.""

The detective smiled and leaned back in his chair. ""Well, it's no trouble at all,"" he said. ""I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this little mystery. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?""

The van said Susan noticed ‘Removers of Distinction’ and indeed every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables and his team of helpers not so gentle. Susan’s hands trembled as she watched her life disappear before her eyes. The house had been her refuge her sanctuary her home. It was where she’d raised her children and had shared countless moments of joy and sorrow with her husband. It was where she’d lived her life and made memories that she cherished. As the removal men worked Susan couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss and sadness. It was as if a part of her was being torn away. The house was more than just a building it was a part of her. It was her history her identity her legacy. And now it was all being taken away. As the removal vans drove away Susan felt a sense of emptiness. Her home was gone and with it a part of her. She was left with nothing but memories and a new life in a new place. She wondered if she would ever feel at home again.

C2,"Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. The dominant male, however, was not interested in letting this newcomer join the group. He immediately set about making the stranger’s life difficult, chasing him around the grove and even attacking him.

Cheney and Seyfarth explain that this behaviour is a form of “male competition” and is driven by the desire to maintain dominance within the group. They point out that this type of competition is not limited to vervet monkeys, but is a common feature of many other primate species. They also note that the intensity of male competition can vary depending on factors such as the size of the group and the availability of food.

In this passage, the authors are describing a behavior observed in vervet monkeys, specifically the dominant male's behavior towards a stranger male who is trying to join the group. The dominant male is not allowing the stranger to join the group and is making his life difficult by chasing and attacking him. The authors explain that this behavior is a form of ""male competition"" driven by the desire to maintain dominance within the group, and is a common feature of many other primate species. They also mention that the intensity of male competition can vary depending on factors such as the size of the group and the availability of food.

The authors use the term ""male competition"" to describe the behavior they are observing, which suggests that they are referring to a specific type of competition that"
C2,"AESTHETICS By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. They are things that are made and have a specific existence independent of the theories that are built about them. This means that the critic or theorist is faced with a problem of interpretation that is not easily solved. For another reason: the works of art are not isolated objects but are part of a complex web of cultural associations and meanings. They are not simply visual or auditory experiences but are also social, historical, and cultural events. This means that any attempt to understand them must take into account not only their formal qualities but also their social and cultural context. The task of aesthetic theory is to provide a framework for understanding and interpreting the works of art in a way that takes into account both their internal structure and their external context. This is a difficult task because it requires the theorist to navigate a complex landscape of cultural associations and meanings, to identify the ways in which the works of art are both autonomous and dependent on their social and cultural context, and to develop a language and a set of concepts that can be used to describe and interpret them.

C2,"Sand Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face gets in your sandwiches and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. It is also a magnet for sandy bottomed creatures like crabs and jellyfish which I find quite unpleasant.
Despite all this I must admit that sand has its uses. It is a natural filter and can help clean pollutants from water. It is also a key ingredient in the construction of many useful objects and materials. And of course it is an essential component of many popular beach activities like building sandcastles and sand sculptures.
In conclusion while sand may not be my personal favorite thing in the world it is clearly an important and useful substance that plays a vital role in many different areas of our lives.
Sand is a natural resource that is essential for various industries, including construction, manufacturing, and agriculture. However, it is also a hostile barrier that can cause problems for beachgoers and water quality. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of sand and its uses in different contexts.
On the one hand, sand is a valuable resource that has many practical applications. It is a key ingredient in the production of concrete and glass, which are essential materials for construction and infrastructure development. Sand is also used in the manufacturing of electronics, such as computers and smartphones, and in the production of various types of filters, including water filtration systems. Moreover, sand is an important component of soil, which is essential for agricult"
C2,"Art on TV Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details.
But in recent years, the only programmes that have been successful in this field have been documentaries. Even these programmes have been few and far between.
There are a number of reasons why television has struggled with programmes about the visual arts. One reason is that the visual arts are inherently difficult to film. Unlike drama or comedy, which can be performed in front of a camera, the visual arts are a static medium. There is no action to film, no dialogue to capture.
Another reason is that television has traditionally been more interested in programmes about popular culture than in programmes about high art. The visual arts are seen as elitist and inaccessible, and television has tended to reinforce these stereotypes by focusing on the latest celebrity art auction or the most expensive painting ever sold.
But the problem goes deeper than this. Television is fundamentally a medium that is designed to tell stories, to create narratives that engage and entertain the viewer. The visual arts are not about stories, they are about the creation of objects that are meant to be looked at and contemplated. This fundamental difference in approach means that the visual arts are always going to be difficult to film in a way that does them justice.
Despite these challenges, there are still many people who are passionate about the visual arts and who want to see more programmes about them on television."
C2,"The Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews.
It is true that actors are not always the most articulate or coherent individuals when discussing their work. They often struggle to explain the intricacies of their craft, and their responses can come across as vague or pretentious.
But let’s not forget that actors are human beings, not robots. They are trained to embody different characters and emotions, and this process can be incredibly draining both physically and mentally. It’s not always easy to articulate one’s thoughts and feelings, especially when one is constantly trying to access and express different identities.
Furthermore, actors are often subject to the whims of directors, producers, and other industry professionals, who can dictate their every move on set. This can lead to a power imbalance that makes it difficult for actors to speak their minds or assert their own creative visions.
So, the next time you encounter an actor who seems vague or pretentious in an interview, try to remember that they are human beings who are doing their best to navigate a complex and often challenging profession. And who knows, they might just surprise you with their insight and eloquence.

C2,"Work Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change. Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood and even among individuals who have won eminence there is often bitterness behind the fame. Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change.
Theodore Zeldin is a French philosopher, sociologist, and novelist who has written extensively on the nature of work and the future of work. In his latest book, ""Another Self: Adventures in the New Science of the Brain,"" he argues that the traditional notion of work as a means of supporting oneself and one's family is no longer relevant in today's society. Instead, he proposes a new vision of work as a source of meaning, fulfillment, and personal growth.
Zeldin begins by acknowledging the challenges faced by many workers today, including the increasing precariousness of employment, the lack of job security, and the growing demand for flexible and remote work arrangements. He argues that these challenges are not simply the result of technological changes or globalization, but rather reflect a deeper shift in the way we understand and value work.
According to Zeldin, the traditional notion of work as a means of supporting oneself and one's family is no longer relevant in today's society. With the rise of the knowledge economy and the increasing importance of skills and creativity, work has become a source of personal fulfillment and growth rather than simply a means of earning a living.

C2,"Kinetic Art Rejoice — the well-nigh impossible has happened: London’s austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not thankfully by some huge-budget mega-hyped multi-media extravaganza but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century.
Kinetic Art, as the name suggests, is art that moves. It has been around since the 1920s and 30s, when artists began experimenting with movement and time in their work. But it wasn’t until the 1950s and 60s that kinetic art really took off, with artists like Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, and George Rickey creating large-scale, dynamic sculptures that seemed to come alive in front of your eyes.
The Hayward Gallery’s exhibition is a joy to behold, with a stunning selection of works by some of the most important kinetic artists of the 20th century. There are over 100 works on display, ranging from small, delicate sculptures to large, complex installations. And the best part is that the works are not just static displays, but are designed to move and change over time, creating a truly immersive experience for the viewer.
One of the standout pieces in the exhibition is Calder’s “Red Mobile,” a stunning mobile made up of red and yellow steel pieces that seem to dance in the air. Another highlight is Tinguely’s “Homage to New York,” a massive sculpture that looks like a cross between a giant metal spider and a spaceship, with moving parts and lights that create a mesmerizing display of movement and color"
C2,"Paul Simon Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked with their destinies.

The music of the 1950s was the soundtrack of a generation coming of age, and it remains so today. The songs of that era evoke a sense of nostalgia, a longing for a time when life was simpler, when the world seemed less complicated.

The 1950s were a time of great social change and upheaval, and rock and roll was a reflection of that. It was a music that spoke to the hopes and fears of a generation, a generation that was struggling to find its place in the world.

Rock and roll was more than just a type of music, it was a cultural phenomenon. It was a symbol of rebellion, a statement of independence, a declaration of individuality. It was a way of life, a way of thinking, a way of feeling.

The 1950s were a time of great creativity and innovation in rock and roll, and the music of that era continues to influence and inspire musicians today. The songs of the 1950s are timeless, and their impact on popular culture is still being felt today.

In conclusion, the 1950s were a pivotal time in the history of rock and roll. It was a decade that saw the emergence of a new type of music, a music that spoke to the hopes and fears of"
C2,"POETRY RECITALS At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view.
We are living through a time when poetry is undergoing a transformation, and it is not clear yet what the new forms will be. The old forms are still vital, and the best poets are still writing in them, but there is a growing sense that the old forms are inadequate to the demands of the present.
The poetry recitals at the library are a manifestation of this confusion. The audience is divided between those who want to hold on to the old forms and those who want to break with them. The poets themselves are divided between those who want to adapt the old forms to the present and those who want to create new forms altogether.
The recitals themselves are a mix of the old and the new. Some of the poets read from their latest works, which are experimental and avant-garde, while others stick to the traditional forms and rhythms of poetry. The audience is equally divided, with some people applauding the innovations and others lamenting the loss of the old.
As the recitals continue, it becomes clear that the transformation of poetry is not just a matter of form, but of content as well. The old poets wrote about love, nature, and the human condition, while the new poets are writing about technology, politics, and the fragmented self.
The confusion and the division are not limited to the poetry recitals, but are reflective of a"
C2,"CRYING Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness. However there is evidence that crying has a range of functions and that these functions may vary depending on the context and the individual.

- Charles Darwin

Charles Darwin, a renowned evolutionary biologist, once questioned the purpose of human tears. He believed that the tendency to cry had no obvious evolutionary advantages. However, recent research has shed light on the social significance of crying. Psychiatrist John Bowlby, among others, has highlighted the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. While tears during childhood are often seen as an expression of helplessness, research suggests that crying has a range of functions, which can vary depending on the context and the individual.

C2,"Blogging: Confessing to the world Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into.
The post was about the risks of public check-ins, but I think it also applies to blogging in general. When you put your thoughts and feelings out there for the world to see, you are in effect making an announcement of your where-abouts. You are saying to the world: “Here I am, come and see what I’m up to.” And just like with public check-ins, not everyone you might want to see might choose to come a-calling.
I’ve been blogging for years, and I’ve learned that it’s important to be mindful of this. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of putting your thoughts and feelings out there, but it’s important to remember that you are, in effect, putting them out there for the world to see. And the world can be a scary place, full of people who might not have your best interests at heart.
So be careful out there, my friends. When you’re blogging, remember that you are making an announcement of your where-abouts – and not everyone you might want to see might choose to come a-calling. Be mindful of that, and be careful about what you put out there.

C2,"Food There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting.
It is a myth that has been perpetuated by the rise of fast food, takeaways and the convenience of pre-packaged meals.
In reality, cooking is not just a means of sustenance, it is a way of life.
We all have our own food memories, some of them happy, some of them sad, but they are all powerful.
They are the reasons why we cook for ourselves, for our loved ones, for our friends, and sometimes for our enemies.
And so, as we delve into the world of food, let us remember that cooking is not just about following a recipe, it is about creating a sense of community, a sense of belonging.
It is about sharing our stories, our memories, our love and our passion for food.
Cooking is a way of life, and this book is a celebration of that life.
So, let us embrace the joy of cooking, let us experiment with new flavours and techniques, and let us never forget that food is not just something we eat, it is a way of life.
And as the great chef, Jamie Oliver, once said, ""Food is life, and life is food.""

C2,The Lure of the Kitchen When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is on the face of it an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long pressured menial - and badly paid. Even those who have succeeded have often had to fight for their place at the top of the profession. And yet I was drawn to the kitchen. There was something about the process of cooking that I found fascinating. I loved the way that ingredients could be transformed into something new and exciting. I loved the creativity of it. The kitchen was a place where you could experiment with flavours textures and presentation. It was a place where you could express yourself and be creative. And so I started experimenting with recipes. I would try out new ingredients new techniques and new ideas. I would spend hours in the kitchen perfecting a single dish. And as I became more confident in my abilities I began to realise that I had a talent for cooking. I could taste the flavours of a dish and imagine how it could be improved. I could see the potential in a dish and bring it to life. And so I began to dream of opening my own restaurant. I would see myself standing behind the counter smiling as customers tucked into my creations. I would be in control of my own kitchen and able to express myself through my food. And so I set out to make my dream a reality. It was not an easy journey. I had to work hard to gain experience and build up a reputation. I had to face rejection and criticism. But I never gave up. I was driven by my
C2,"TIM RICE I was ushered into the young man’s drawing room an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class. The young man himself was tall and dark and had the look of one who had been born to a life of privilege and responsibility. His eyes were bright and alert, his manner confident and informed. He was dressed in a very expensive suit and tie, and he looked as though he had just come from a board meeting. He greeted me warmly, and we sat down to talk.

The young man’s name was Tim Rice, and he was the son of the famous actor and playwright, Sir Laurence Olivier. Tim had grown up surrounded by the theatre and the arts, and he had followed in his father’s footsteps, becoming a successful playwright and screenwriter in his own right.

As we talked, Tim spoke about his childhood and his early days in the theatre. He told me about the time he had spent with his father, watching him rehearse and perform, and about the lessons he had learned from him. He spoke with great affection and respect for his father, and it was clear that he had been deeply influenced by him.

But Tim was also very much his own man, with his own distinct voice and style. He spoke about his own work, including his most recent play, which was about the life of a famous composer. He was passionate and knowledgeable about his subject, and his enthusiasm was infectious.

C2,Advertising on trial If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. As a result of this many advertising agencies found themselves struggling to survive. For some of these agencies the recession was a watershed moment in their history. It forced them to re evaluate their business models and strategies and to explore new opportunities for growth. One of the key trends that emerged from this period was the growing importance of digital media in advertising. In the early 1990s the internet was still in its infancy but it was already having a profound impact on the way that people consumed media and communicated with each other. As the internet became more widely available and more accessible to consumers advertisers began to see the potential for using it as a platform for reaching their target audiences. This was a major shift from the traditional methods of advertising that had dominated the industry for decades. It required advertising agencies to rethink their approach to advertising and to develop new skills and expertise in the areas of digital media and technology. This was not an easy task as many agencies had to completely overhaul their operations and invest in new infrastructure and staff in order to remain competitive in the rapidly changing advertising landscape. Despite the challenges however the recession of the early 1990s also presented some opportunities for advertising agencies. As businesses cut back on their marketing budgets many agencies were able to pick up work from
C2,"How to Write Poetry Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face.

But since you asked, I will offer a few suggestions for writing poetry:

1. Write about what you know. This seems obvious, but it's surprising how many poets try to write about things they don't really know anything about. Write about your childhood, your family, your hometown, your favorite foods, your memories, your dreams, your fears, your joys, your sorrows, your hopes, your disappointments, your regrets, your triumphs, your loves, your hates, your doubts, your certainties, your uncertainties.

2. Use your senses. Poetry is a sensory art form, so try to engage the reader's senses in your writing. Describe what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Use vivid and specific language to bring your poem to life.

3. Play with language. Poetry is all about language, so have fun with it! Experiment with different rhythms, rhymes, and word choices. Use alliteration, assonance, and consonance to create musical effects. Try to create a sense of flow and movement in your poem, like a river or a breeze.

4. Experiment with different forms. Poetry comes in many forms, such as sonnets, haikus, free verse, and"
C2,Online Literary Criticism For All Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun? From the outset the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice however a certain amount of technical know-how was required at least in the early years. This barrier to entry was particularly problematic for those who were not part of the existing academic or technical elite. The idea of do-it-yourself (DIY) literary criticism was born out of this need to democratize access to the tools of literary criticism. The basic idea is simple: rather than relying on a select group of experts to interpret and analyze texts readers themselves can use online tools to perform their own critical analyses. In this way DIY literary criticism seeks to empower readers to take an active role in shaping their own cultural landscape. In order to explore the implications of DIY literary criticism we will examine the following questions: What are the practical challenges and limitations of DIY literary criticism? How does DIY literary criticism relate to other forms of online literary criticism? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of DIY literary criticism for both readers and writers? Is DIY literary criticism more than just a harmless form of entertainment? This essay will argue that DIY literary criticism is not just a frivolous form of entertainment but rather a legitimate form of literary criticism that can provide valuable insights into the ways in which readers engage with texts. However it is important to recognize that DIY literary criticism is not a replacement for traditional forms of literary criticism but rather a supplement that can enhance and expand our understanding of literature. In order to make this argument we will examine the

C2,Love them fear them worship them human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports There's a bump bump bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird a bird of portent augury and divination. In ancient cultures the wren was seen as a messenger between the mortal world and the realm of the gods. In Irish folklore it was believed to carry the souls of the dead to the afterlife. In medieval Europe the wren was associated with witchcraft and the devil: a sign of ill omen and misfortune. And yet the wren is also the smallest bird in the world the most unlikely of messengers the most improbable of gods. It's a bird of such contradictions that it's impossible to pin down its meaning. And yet we can't help but be drawn to it. The wren is a bird of mystery and intrigue. It's a bird that speaks to something deep within us: a sense of wonder and awe at the natural world a sense of connection to something greater than ourselves. The wren is a bird of the imagination a bird of myth and legend. It's a bird that reminds us of the magic that lies just beyond the edge of our everyday lives. The wren is a bird that speaks to our deepest fears and desires: our fear of the unknown and our longing for transcendence. It's a bird that challenges us to question our assumptions and our beliefs. And it's a bird that offers us a glimpse of something greater than ourselves: something that lies beyond the reach of our
C2,"Joanna’s Lessons Joanna MacGregor has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist. So why has she added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano? Even a member of that mythical species the completely tone deaf could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. And now she has written a series of books to help young children learn to play the piano. Why has she taken on this extra task? I put this question to her as we sat in the elegant drawing room of her home in North London. Joanna smiled and leaned back in her chair. “I have always been passionate about music education,” she said. “As a concert pianist, I have seen firsthand how important it is for children to learn to play the piano, not just for their technical skills, but for their emotional and social development as well. “But I also know that many children struggle to find the motivation and support they need to pursue music education. So I wanted to create something that would make it easier and more accessible for them to learn.” The series of books, titled “Piano Adventures,” is designed for children aged 5 to 8, and is aimed at providing a fun and engaging introduction to the piano. Each book includes a CD with audio examples of the pieces, as well as a range of interactive features, such as stickers and coloring pages. Joanna has worked closely with a team of educators and musicians to develop the series, and has tested it with children in schools and at her own piano studio. “I wanted to create something that would be both fun and challenging for children,” she said. “I believe that learning to play the piano should be a positive and enjoyable experience"
C2,"Every Picture Tells a Story Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer but also illuminating. Working on a script I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point. Its a bit like editing your own novel in reverse. I also realized that sometimes the most seemingly insignificant details in the novel can be the key to unlocking the entire story. In one novel I was working on the protagonist had a habit of tying his shoelaces in a very particular way. It was a tiny detail that seemed inconsequential at first but it turned out to be the linchpin of the entire plot. Every picture tells a story, as the saying goes, and the same is true of every detail in a novel. It can be tempting to try to cram too much into a screenplay, but the best way to succeed is to focus on the essentials and let go of the rest. This is true not just of the dialogue and action but also of the narrative structure and even the characters themselves. Its easy to fall into the trap of thinking that every character needs to be fully fleshed out and every plot twist needs to be telegraphed from a mile away. But the truth is that the best screenplays are those that are lean and efficient, that use every element to serve the story rather than the other way around. So the next time youre working on a script, take a lesson from the old adage every picture tells a story and focus on the essentials. Youll be glad you did. 119

C2,"HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. He led three expeditions to the Antarctic, the last of which, in the early 1920s, ended in disaster when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in pack ice and eventually sank. Shackleton and his men were stranded on the ice for 22 months before they managed to escape, a remarkable feat of endurance and leadership that has made him a legendary figure in the history of exploration. But now, almost a century after his death, Shackleton is being rediscovered as a model of good management. In recent years, American executives have been studying his life and exploits, and finding lessons in his leadership style that they believe can be applied to modern business. Shackleton was known as a ""people person"", says Dr Tim Hands, the headmaster of Rugby School, where Shackleton was a pupil. He was a man who understood the importance of building a strong team, and of treating his crew with respect and compassion. ""He was a great communicator, and he had a talent for bringing out the best in people,"" says Dr Hands. ""He was able to inspire his team to do things they thought were impossible."" Shackleton's leadership style is being contrasted with that of more modern business leaders, who are often criticised for being too focused on profits and shareholder value.

C2,Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain. In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. This has had a profound effect on the way we listen to music and on the music industry itself. The development of digital technology has allowed for the creation of new forms of music and new ways of distributing music. The rise of the internet has revolutionized the way we access and listen to music. The ease of downloading music from the internet has made it possible to access music from all over the world and to discover new artists and genres. The internet has also made it possible to create and distribute music independently without the need for a record label. The digital music revolution has created new opportunities for musicians and composers to create and distribute their work. The rise of streaming services such as Spotify and Apple music has transformed the way we listen to music. Streaming services allow us to access a vast library of music without the need to purchase or download individual tracks. This has made music more accessible and affordable for many people. However the rise of streaming services has also raised questions about the future of the music industry. With streaming services paying royalties to record labels and publishers rather than to the musicians themselves there are concerns that the financial rewards for musicians may be diminished. In addition the rise of streaming services has also led to concerns about the value of music and the way it is distributed and consumed. The development of digital technology and the rise of the internet have also had an impact on the way we create and produce music. With

C2,"Photography When a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills personal views and experience together with a set of social and cultural norms.
Photography can be used in a variety of ways. It can be used to capture a moment in time, to tell a story, to document an event, to create an artwork, to communicate an idea or emotion, or to simply record the world around us.
The camera is the tool that allows the photographer to select and organize the visual information that will be included in the photograph. The photographer can choose the point of view from which the photograph will be taken, the aperture and shutter speed to control the amount of light that enters the camera, the focal length to control the depth of field, and the ISO to control the sensitivity of the camera.
In addition to technical considerations, photography also involves aesthetic considerations. The photographer must make decisions about composition, balance, color, and other visual elements that contribute to the overall effect of the photograph.
The photographer must also consider the social and cultural context of the photograph. Photography can be used to reinforce or challenge social and cultural norms, and the photographer must be aware of the potential impact of the photograph on the audience.
Finally, photography is a form of communication that can be used to convey a message or emotion to the viewer. The photographer must consider the intended audience and the message or emotion that they want to convey through the photograph.

To relax in the evening residents stroll down the city streets and if you join them you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. 

It is said that over 50% of Vancouver's population are immigrants. This is a high percentage compared to other major cities around the world. Many of these immigrants have come from Asia, particularly China, and the Middle East. 

Vancouver is a city of contrasts, where the old and the new, the traditional and the modern, exist side by side. The city has a rich history and culture, but it is also a city of change and growth. It is a place where people from all over the world come to build new lives and to create a new future. 

In addition to its diverse population, Vancouver is also known for its natural beauty. The city is surrounded by mountains, forests, and waterways, and it is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. The city has a mild climate, with plenty of rain and mild winters, making it an ideal place to live.

C2,"MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house I learned that opera is in fact only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That’s as it should be of course. The music is the thing that really matters. The singing, the orchestration, the harmony, the melody. All that stuff. The theatre is just a framework for it. But the theatre is still important. The way the singers move on stage, the way the orchestra is lit, the way the audience is positioned. All that stuff is important too. It’s like a big puzzle. You’ve got to get all the pieces right. And that’s what makes opera so bloody difficult. But also so bloody brilliant. I was lucky enough to see a production of La Bohème at the Royal Opera House a few weeks ago. It was a bit of a mess, to be honest. The singers were all off pitch and the staging was a bit clunky. But it didn’t matter. The music was still incredible. I’ve seen some brilliant productions of opera too. The Ring Cycle at Bayreuth, for example. That was incredible. The music, the staging, the whole thing. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen before. I’ve also seen some terrible productions of opera. The kind of thing where the singers are miming to a recording of the music and the staging is just a bunch of nonsense. That’s not opera. That’s just a bunch of people pretending to be opera singers. Opera"

It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. The term 'broadcasting' was borrowed from agriculture in the early days of radio in the 1920s. The idea was to spread broadcasts as widely as possible. The term was used to describe the new medium because it was thought to have the same qualities as the broadcast of seeds. The development of broadcasting is closely tied to the development of radio communication and the history of broadcasting is a story of the social shaping of a technology. The use of the term 'broadcasting' is a reflection of the optimistic view of modern society. The idea is that if the right conditions are in place, a rich harvest can be produced.

C2,"Writing Reviews Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner’s point of view. Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. This is true of all types of reviews, from the most formal to the most informal. The review is usually written for a specific occasion, such as the publication of a new book or the opening of a film. It is meant to be read and then forgotten, its usefulness exhausted. The very brevity of the review’s life means that it must be written with a keen sense of purpose, and with the knowledge that its impact will be fleeting.
Frank Kermode was a British literary critic, scholar, and writer. He was born on October 16, 1919, in London, England, and died on September 16, 2005, in Cambridge, England.

C2,"Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941 despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst its alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. In the fifties and sixties, when most of the original audience was now in their forties or older, Citizen Kane began to appear on TV, where it was hailed as a new kind of film experience. It was seen as a landmark in the development of the medium, and its influence was acknowledged by generations of filmmakers. In 1967, the American Film Institute voted Citizen Kane the greatest film of all time. The story of Citizen Kane is the story of how a film can outlast its time, its creator, and its audience. Orson Welles was only twenty-five when he made the film, and his career never quite recovered from the setbacks that followed its release. But the film itself, like some kind of independent entity, went on to become a legend. Citizen Kane is the story of a man who becomes a legend, and the film itself is a kind of legend. The film is a biography of Charles Foster Kane, the newspaper magnate, but it is also a meditation on the nature of power, the uses of wealth, and the cost of ambition. It is a film about the way people are, and the way they might be. The film begins with Kane’s death, and then unravels his life through a series of flashbacks.

Breakfast as we know it today is a relatively modern invention. Prior to the 18th century, the first meal of the day in England was typically eaten around midday and consisted of a light meal of bread, cheese, and beer or ale.
The rise of breakfast as we know it today can be traced back to the 18th century when the Industrial Revolution transformed the way people lived and worked. As more and more people moved from rural areas to cities, they needed a quick and convenient way to fuel up for their day ahead.
In response, entrepreneurs began to market breakfast foods such as porridge, toast, and eggs, which were easy to prepare and could be consumed on the go. By the early 20th century, breakfast had become a standard meal of the day, with many people eating breakfast at home or in cafes.
Today, breakfast remains an important meal, with many people choosing to eat a combination of sweet and savory foods, including cereals, toast, eggs, bacon, and panc"
