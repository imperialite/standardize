A2,"Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings like museums to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. They also check that the plans are approved. There are many people that work on each one of the buildings. Sometimes, the people decide to change the plan or if the structure is too old. But, most of the time they agree on what to do. They choose the best method to change it because it depends on the type of the building. Sometimes, a new structure is built. Usually, the people who have worked on the structure for a long time make sure that it will last for a long time. For example, the people who have designed the stadium will make sure that it will keep playing football for a long time. The people who have worked on the museum won’t change it for a long time but they make sure that it is full of beautiful things so people will visit it often. I decided to write about buildings because I think they are very important to us. You should know how important they are because we need them. The houses make us feel happy. For example, if you have a beautiful house, you won’t want to go out for a long time. And you will be happy because you have a beautiful house and it will make you happy to stay at home. I think everyone has a beautiful house. Sometimes, I wish I had a beautiful house. I think it would be much nicer to live in a beautiful house than in a cheap one.   I hope that the people who work on buildings can make the best decision. I hope"
A2,"'No' said Harry. 'I won't go. I'm your best man and this town has problems.' 'Yes' said Paul 'you are my best man. But you must understand something. After we go the people here in Dante's Peak will stay. They have their shops and their businesses. You think only about volcanoes but this is about money too.' 'OK' Harry said with a smile. He had made Paul his best man and together they were the best men in the world. The wedding day was the best day of their lives and they had been planning this day for three years. There was a wedding party that had been invited by the mayor, and there were many people in this town, but only a few would be able to attend the wedding. They were the richest men in Dante's Peak and they had planned their wedding for two years so that the mayor of Dante's Peak would have an excuse to invite so many people. There were no other wedding ceremonies in the town, there had never been any. The first thing the mayor had said when he was informed of their relationship was 'I think you two are great and I think you have a very good future. But it will be great if you can stay in this town until we have an earthquake.' They were going to have an earthquake, and they needed to stay here. But their first duty was to prepare the town for the earthquake, and so they began with the construction of the dam. 'I know who made the dam and I know who will pay the consequences,' said the mayor. They would be the ones who would suffer from the earthquake. But the mayor was going to tell them the truth. 'After the earthquake the mayor will be killed,' he said. The two richest men in Dante's Peak had decided to build the dam to protect the town. It was not safe to build in the earthquake and so"
A2,"Careful! Fight with your head don't fight with your heart boy!' shouted Bowen. The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter. But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code. Sir Bowen and all the kings princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. But a thousand years ago peasants began to fight. And the old code was broken. The peasants would not let their king go by himself. And they began to fight to the last man. And no one was more vicious than the peasants. The knights also began to fight to the last man. And many a time knights died. Some were killed in the battle. Some died from hunger. But one knight was killed by the peasants. He had fought them for thousands of years. And he was not afraid of death. The peasants would not stop fighting. One day a peasant looked at his weapon and said. 'This weapon is too slow to kill! It needs at least two men to kill one man.' And he threw down his weapon and told his fellow peasants. 'We will go and kill the knights.' And he told them how to pick up a club. They dug a trench around the king. And they buried the king in the trench. Then they went to the battle. They found a knight. He was dead, his sword was cut off at the hilt. The peasants looked around and saw the remaining knights. They were laughing. They were so cruel. The peasants thought that they would get revenge. They gathered all their weapons and attacked the knights. They fell to the peasants' weapons. But when they were all dead, the peasants left. 'We have killed the last man,' said the peasant. But the peasants went to the king. And they told the king about"
A2,The History of Farming Before people started farming they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. They knew how to make the soil fertile and they knew how to prepare the ground for the crops. They lived in houses so that they didn’t have to move their food. These people have been farming for more than 13000 years. You can read more about this history at the history of farming. But that’s only part of it. The second part of the history of farming is how people started using animals. People had to gather food in the middle of the day so that they could go to work at night. This is why the second part of the history of farming is important. To keep working all day they had to gather food in the morning and then go to work. The people used animals because they were too old to carry food back and forth. These animals were able to travel and make it to work when the sun was up. After the animals came men. They were always in the middle of the day so they could gather food. They lived on the animals so they could collect enough food to have food for the people that were working all day. The people lived in houses because this way they didn’t have to worry about getting food. This is the story of farming. It was all about gathering food and having a good life. There’s also an episode on this show called “Taste the Future” that you can watch. It tells the story of how food is made today. I can’t tell you much
A2,"ICE-FISHING If you drive north from Toronto for three hours you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter the lake becomes ice and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. This is an art that is practiced each year by hundreds of people. The fishing is for Atlantic salmon, halibut, cod, walleye, northern pike and trout. Some fish are caught when the ice is open and can be sold on the market. If you have not visited the lake in winter, you will have an idea about what I am talking about when I say the people there do not waste their time with ""ice fishing"". They know what kind of fish swim under the ice. I had an opportunity to visit the Lake Nipissing in November 2001 when the weather was good and the Canadian ice fishing season was starting. There were not many people on the ice but it was still fun to walk on the ice or to sit on the ice beside the people who have been fishing all their lives. The men in the ice house were very patient when their fish were caught. They would stand on the ice and stare at the fish they had caught with a big smile on their faces. They would keep telling them it would take a little while to cut it up because the fish were so big. When they were about to cut the fish into bits they would look at them with surprise and then say ""We must wait for the ice to open"", because once it was open the fish would come to the surface of the water. They would be able to walk on the ice and see the other anglers who had spent time there for years. It is really a joy to"
A2,"A man heard me and looked round. Then this big man saw me in the corn. He walked to me and I began to shout loudly:'His foot is going to kill me!'The man stopped. For a minute he looked down at me carefully. (We look at a small animal in the same way and think: 'Will it hurt me? ') He looked at me and then left. I was on the floor, covered with corn. (The man walks in a field and is thinking to himself: 'How is that possible... ) I was a little hurt.

He saw a bird sitting on a branch of a tree. It was really scared. The farmer thought: ""Oh, that is a bird. If that bird is really scared then he/she is not gonna come down from there. If it is afraid then it is not gonna eat the corn."" After that a man saw that bird sitting on that tree. The man asked the bird: ""Why are you standing there alone?"" The bird said: ""Because you don't care. The world is a terrible place to live, but at least I have a shelter and food."" The man thought: ""That is a very strong bird.

A2,"Memo To: All staff Subject: Holidays From: D Brown Date: 22.2.02 I am planning the holidays for next year. Please tell me when you would like to take your holiday. If possible could you give me two dates? Please give me your answer by the end of the month. Thank you. D Brown, Director (Tel: 0871 876 9600 - Mobile: +44 (0)7776 647 454)

A:

I did this every year between 2005 and 2008. You only get the whole month in any given year, so don't try to get a multi-week period for the same period of time. When it came to the summer, I just picked a date for the whole month and booked time around that.I never did this personally, so don't take my word for it, but I know that Holidays for me were organised by my manager, who was always up to date on things. She would always write the dates and times down and would let us know who was in charge of the holidays, and then make the necessary arrangements. 
I don't think there's anything wrong with using a standard 'Holiday Calendar' on your desk, if that's all you've got. It doesn't have to be fancy or anything, just a couple of pages showing the dates and times. You can use different calendars depending on how many weeks you want for the holidays you want, but I'm afraid there are no apps or sites out there that will do this for you (unless you're really, really clever).
Personally I find this easier than having to plan the holidays myself! I could always use some help though, and that's why I've put my email in the question. If you do decide to"
A2,"New books this month The Long Night This is David Reilly's first book. David became a writer after teaching English for several years. Maha is a nurse in northern Australia where she works in a small hospital. One day a baby is so ill that Maha has to drive all night to get her to the nearest big city. I read The Long Night first and it is a wonderful book about a couple of months spent working in an Australian hospital. The book is very well written and I would definitely recommend it to anybody who wants to know about the Australian healthcare system. There is a bit too much English in this book, for sure. I guess that is because the book is written by a professional. Maha and her patient should have been able to understand each other in Australian. But the author also talks a bit too much in his English that it is quite hard to follow. But if you already know a lot about Australian healthcare, it is a very good book to have. From the very beginning, the book takes you on a trip into the Australian health system. We start by looking at the hospital staff, and what they do day-in and day-out. We learn more about the hospital through their daily routines, and we see how people deal with patients who are dying and dying. I think that is the most impressive part of the book. The hospital is full of nurses, who talk about the patients that they will see in the morning, or who will receive a new baby, or who will receive a dying man. That is so interesting. It is quite a strange sight to see a baby, or an old man with a cancer, and how they deal with that. You learn so much from just that few hours. From the hospital, it is a quick drive to the beach where the doctor works"
A2,"Big cats There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot!

Kittens In a year there are more than 500,000 new kitten born in the world. These kittens can live for only 6 months. But there are big kittens which are 14, 15 or 16 weeks of age and they can live until they are 5 years old.

Domestic Animals These animals are kept as pets and they have a very different relationship to humans. They are social and love humans. They have an almost human like body, but they have no ears. Most domestic cats have six legs. They are smaller than tigers. They usually have a white coat with black spots. They don't like water.

Elephants Elephants are the tallest creatures in the world. They are 4.5m long and weigh 60,000kg. Elephants are not very friendly animals. They don't like humans and they don't like to be touched. The elephants that lived thousands of years ago lived near water. Most of the elephants are found in Africa.

Giants Giants are 4m to 6m long. They are found in Australia. Giants often look like lions, tigers and other large cats. They have a very large head and chest. They never live as pets but they can live until they are 50 years old.

Crocodiles Crocodiles are the biggest animals in the world. They are over 6m long. They live on the coast in the sea and can swim very quickly. They love to swim and"

'Silvia dear' Marco said 'you look wonderful...' He stopped. Silvia didn't look wonderful. Her face was red and she looked unhappy. 'Are you sure you've come home from work? You must have fallen asleep on the way. I must go home now. I'll see you on Sunday. Bye' She closed the door and Marco walked away. Marco thought, she is a witch. He looked in the mirror and said, yes. He smiled. He was in the right way. Marco entered his flat and he saw Gabriel coming in. Gabriel looked really bad. He had no hair, was thin and his dress was dirty. 'Marco! I don't want to say anything to you' said Gabriel 'but I thought you were a witch.' Marco laughed and Gabriel said,' I am too but you think so, because of my clothes.''Why didn't you come home? I didn't expect this unexpected visit.' 'I haven't got any money. My boss wanted me to come in early and collect my salary. I told him I couldn't do that because I had some problems with the boss. But he said, don't worry. You don't have to work until the end of the month. You can take your time. He looked very worried.' 'And I believed him. So I stayed away until this morning. I came home and I had no money. I ran out of the building and I fell down. And the police will be here any minute. This is a small town. It will be very expensive if I got arrested.' 'Marco, come back! Your girlfriend is waiting."
A2,"'I am quite well' I always answered. Why did I say that? Why did I not ask for his help? Perhaps because in one sense it was true. I was not in pain. 'It cannot be the mysterious illness from the village' I thought. 'My illness is now three weeks old. I can't hide my disability now. I have to face it. If I can manage to get to the doctor's I will do that' I started to feel that I would never manage to face my illness. My body had become so weak that I was forced to sit on the edge of the bed and to wait. I didn't want to see my family. I wanted them to forget about me, to leave me alone. And yet, they never left me alone. I was always with them. Every Sunday morning my brothers and I attended Mass at the church we have always used. There we were united as always. Every Sunday morning we listened to Our Father and to the prayer for those departed and asked for our salvation. My mother always said the Our Father in the same way that she used to say it when she read the Litany of the Saints and when we were young we never questioned her. I was always in awe of my mother. I was her child; she always loved me. We never had a row. She took care of me. I never complained to her. I always felt happy that she loved me. But I couldn't stand it any longer. My mother was always watching me as though I was a little delinquent. Every day I had to prove that I was not a delinquent. It was a long time before I was able to go to Mass. I felt so ashamed and I was so scared that I couldn't get out of the house. So,"

They're good photos aren't they? I hope you like them. I really love my new camera. It's really easy to use, and I'm really glad I bought it. I think it'll be a good camera for my job. Maybe I'll put it on my blog too. I'll think about that. You might want to send it to my school as a memento. I'm sure everyone will like to have it in their room. It looks a good memento for me.

A2,"BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window.
Burglars love the afternoon. They always do it. There are lots of burglaries during the day because people are not home and because criminals are always searching for places for break-ins.
BURGLAR VILLAS In Mexico it's common for a burglar to break into two or more houses. A thief who has committed two or more burglaries will often take the time to search each house because he feels sure that it won't be any of the other houses. Sometimes, he will find something he wants to sell to buy food. If the other burglars don't want to sell their stolen goods, a thief will just take them anyway. If a thief finds nothing of value to sell and still wants to get rid of his stolen goods, he will look for a burglary. If he finds one, he will break in and steal everything he wants.
BURGLAR HOMES If burglars want to find a wealthy family or a rich widow or orphan, they will always look for a house for burglary. In the early morning or in the late afternoon, burglars try to hide from a policeman in the garden or in the bedroom. Then they will try to open the door. If the burglar doesn't find anyone, they will try the front door. If that's also locked, they will try the porch and if the porch is also locked they will go up the stairs, go into the attic and look for a hiding place. If no one"

A2,"Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good in the water and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair and this keeps them warm in the water. Otters live in small groups and hunt for food in large groups. They love to get food to feed their families. They are very smart because they can recognize other otters by the sound of their screech. It’s the sound they make while hunting for prey. When otters swim, they also make a sort of sound' to let other otters know when a prey is coming. When otters are in large groups, they also make their own  sound' with their  screech. The otters love fresh fish but they will also eat small invertebrates like mollusks. They also swim around in ponds and rivers. Otters are very curious animals and sometimes they try to jump into the water. Otters do not have any special sense of smell but they do have very good hearing. They can also hear the sounds that the other animals make. They can listen to the food that other animals produce and know when to return to the banks to steal the food from the other animals’ mouths. Oftentimes an otter will be the only animal in the water so the otters can be pretty picky about what they steal. Otters love to eat small pieces of wood but they are very good at hiding this. They can find food anywhere as long as they know where to look. They live in groups, so if there’s no food they will"

'People welcome me everywhere I go and when I get home I remember all the wonderful things that happened in each country.' Nick has travelled to many places but there are a few trips that he would still like to make. These include visiting Ireland, America and Antarctica.

 I want to see the South Pole and try to go back to the South Pole to see what it's like. I've seen the Arctic before and, when you're out there in the Arctic, you don't really understand how cold it is. I want to see it again when it's not as cold.' 
  
 But, for the time being, Nick is staying put. He lives in Loughborough with his wife, Jane, his parents and sister and he visits home every year. He thinks that if you spend too much time in one place you lose the ability to wander around.

The Southern side of the planet is actually warmer as it lies closer to the equator, and is also the side that most of the glaciers are on. This means that when the glaciers flow away,"

A2,"The history of horse racing From the first history books ever written it is clear that horse racing has always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. In the 19th century racing came to England and after World War II it was developed into an English sport. In 1947 the British Racehorse Society was formed to promote and organise racing in Britain. In 1958 a competition began to determine the best British jockey. The first horse ever to win the Derby was Magic Hill at Epsom. Since then British thoroughbreds have won almost every race in which they have competed and have become the most famous racehorses in the world. In the 1960s, the sport became popular in America and a new sport developed from racing called the thoroughbred. Racing was made legal and regulated in Britain in 1848. In 1891, the first meeting between horses was held at Sandown Park, in Northamptonshire. Horse racing has always been an important sport in Britain. It started at Sandown Racecourse in 1891 and racing went to the National Equestrian Centre at Haydock Park in 1964. Horses compete in races which can be run at any time and place as long as they are kept under control and at a relatively quick pace. Horses that are good in both riding and jumping were often preferred over those that are good in both. Horsemanship was always a key factor when judging a horse. The British Racehorse Society is the organisation that governs all horse racing in Britain. Although it was founded in 1947, the Society has had problems in the past with some individuals causing interference. The Society’s most famous member was Prince"

'Where are you going Dad?' I asked. 'To a meeting.' 'What meeting? Can I come?' 'No you're too young' said Dad. 'But I want to know all the details Jude!' 'But I don't want to go Jude. I want to stay at home and stay with you.' 'But you're a bit old to be staying at home.' 'Well I was eight years old before my death. I didn't want to die at 16 and look as if I was going to be living at home.' 'I won't stay at home and I won't die.' 'I know you won't Jude. But you've got to do something.' 'I'll think about it.'
Jude had the same dream twice in a row. The first dream was about him and Mum walking along the beach together. At the end of the walk they stood together on the sand and had a nice chat about life and death. They were the only two people there. The next dream was about his death. He was at the beach with Dad. A ship sank and a few others were trapped. They were going to die. They walked around the wreck trying to find something to swim to and then finally they saw a boat and went on it. Then it started to move around. Then they realised it was going to come towards them. They saw a man waving a towel and started to run but a wave from the boat and a strong current caught them.

She wanted to know why he had left her husband to go into the jungle and then come back with a huge lion, so they agreed that she could have a lion too, if she would only do some chores for him and make some tea for him once a day. But the wife said 'No, I won't.' The donkey was riding along a road. There was nothing to do, so he said, 'I'll go for a ride!' He went away from home and came back tired and hungry. He looked at the house and asked, 'How much money has your wife got to pay for my milk to cook this dinner tonight?' The donkey asked the house 'How much money has"
A2,"Bill Prince-Smith Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer and a teacher and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now thirteen years later he has written more than 80 books. Every day he goes into his office and writes. In the evening he gives the work to his wife to read. Bill Prince-Smith's first book, ""The Little Prince and His Dog"", was published on 4 January 1965 and has become one of the best selling books in England. Since then he has always written new stories and they have been published in twelve editions, some of them more than one hundred hundred copies. These books were published in nine countries, as well as in two thousand newspapers, books, magazines and television.

Then they have to leave the village. However, their love does not end there. They decide to live in a castle. The Little Prince, who goes from room to room, never has to stop and does not know any room in the castle that he cannot reach. Prince-Smith has always wanted to write"
A2,"Line dancing Thousands of people in Britain have a new hobby — line dancing. In almost every town you will find clubs and classes for this new activity. 'Line dancing is easy to learn. If you have two feet and can walk then you can do it!' Fiona Lever a teacher says. 
  
 The word line dancing comes from the Italian lineare, and means 'pushing'. It was originally danced with a partner, but now there are many independent practitioners in Britain. In a club, each participant is given a partner, and a set of dances to do together. They all learn to turn and twist, a combination of arm and leg moves which is called a tuck dance. The more senior people who are more experienced wear shoes. The younger folk wear tights and sometimes knee warmers, though usually only on warm days, and they do not wear shoes. 
  
 The tucks are basic arm moves. The partner moves his arms in a graceful manner, which produces a beautiful sound like waves, and is followed by an equally graceful twisting movement. This part is called a sashay. The tucks are accompanied with arm movements which are called a spin. Every dancer is asked to spin at some point throughout the sashay. The sashays are usually accompanied by a sashay variation, which is the twirl, where the tucks are used as the base of the twirl. 
  
 The moves that dance can make are really simple — just a basic twirl, sashay, or spin. But to make the best of these movements, they are all joined together in dance form which is called a tuck dance. The dances can be done by two or more people. But some dances"
A2,"Kong went back to Ann and took her down from the high rock. For the first time in this jungle she felt strangely safe. He jumped across a ravine and then across a river. She was a small plaything between his large fingers. Then he stopped and put her down. She tried to scream. He stopped and just stared. She looked up at him, a look of fear in her eyes. Then she looked back at the jungle below and saw the wild animals. She was about to jump and run when she heard Kong’s growling voice. She looked back and saw him on top of the high rock, growling. She tried to jump down and run, but couldn't. She looked back at Kong and saw his eyes glowering from the rock. Kong turned his head and ran toward the jungle. She tried to scream, but it was all she could do.

She stared in the darkness at the high rock and then started crying. She started running. But in the distance she heard a scream. It was a woman. She saw it coming -- a woman in high heels running toward the jungle, followed by a man in a long cape with a bow and arrow. The woman screamed and the man just stood there.

She sprinted back into the jungle and ran as fast as she could. She heard more screams. Then she heard a man's voice yell after her. She turned to see a man with a gun looking down at the jungle. He had to be the hunter, she realized. He was on a mission, to kill this man.

The man's voice sounded far away now. She ran even faster. She heard the screams again. She ran faster. She ran so fast that she hurt herself"

A2,"The Rhino There are five different types of rhino in the world today. The Black and White Rhino live in the open fields of Africa. The others live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have big heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The great body of the rhino stands on four short legs. Black and White Rhinos can run faster than any other rhino and sometimes they jump high over the treetops. White Rhinos have pale yellow or orange skin like a monkey or a horse. They are the slowest and the smallest of the rhino. They are also the most dangerous of the five rhino species. Their small size means they can eat anything like roots and shoots and grasses. The rhino has to avoid these creatures. The Yellow, White, Black, and White rhino cannot run as fast as other rhino species. They can jump high in the trees like a monkey, but they have to run very slow. This is because of their smaller body. Their skin is very white. White Rhinos have three horns on the top of their heads. They are used for protection. The White rhino can't breed because their eggs can't be bred by other rhino species. They are often protected by White Rhinos and have their horns used for this. The Black and White Rhinos have two horns on their heads. The horns are used for aggression. If they see another Black and White Rhino they will get aggressive. The Black and White Rhinos are the most aggressive rhino species. The smallest of the five rhino species. They are the most active of the five. They are used to moving about their herds. The Black and White rhino can not get rid of their black spots. When they see each other their spots appear.

A2,"CANADA GEESE Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there. Last spring Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. In the winter Bill lives on the farm with his wife Nancy and their two sons Robert and Bill Jr.. The first week in June he saw a goose with the beak of an adult. The goose was walking across the barnyard. It had no feathers on the feet and no bill. After two days the goose ran up to Bill. At that moment Bill saw something which was more extraordinary than a goose and a beautiful bird, it was a Canada Geese. It was big enough to take a look at it. A Canada Goose lays one white egg every year. It does not lay an egg every day. It lays about seven eggs at one time. In summer the goose gets ready to lay and then in early spring it is gone from the barnyard. It usually comes back in mid-August and lays about one egg every day, from one to five days later. On the morning of the morning of June 7th Bill saw a goose with the beak of an adult. The goose was sitting quietly in the centre of the barnyard but he still heard the mother goose. Then he saw the goose had grown a new beak with four brown feathers, but the rest was the same. Next week he saw a goose who had grown a black beak. The goose looked a little scared, as if it was afraid to take the egg from the nest in the centre of the barn. Finally, on the evening of June 14th he saw a goose with the beak of a"
A2,"Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago a long time before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died. The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. Some were long and slender, others were huge. If you wanted to look at a dinosaur, you had to be very close to its skeleton to see it clearly. You never got to see the bones from a long extinct dinosaur, because all fossils were lost to time. It is impossible to make a guess as to why dinosaurs died. There was no reason for them to disappear from the earth. A lot of people think that they were wiped out by a meteor that smashed into the earth and buried it beneath tons of debris. Other people think that dinosaurs were wiped out by another giant predator. A few years ago, scientists discovered a small piece of a dinosaur leg. The scientists thought that it was a dinosaur toe, but DNA tests showed that it was not a dinosaur toe at all. It was actually a small bird toe. The scientists thought that it was very strange that this foot still had feathers in it. Now scientists believe that birds got their feathers by using dinosaur bones and feathers. It is possible that they even ate dinosaur meat. All this may be explained by a giant meteor that hit the earth 65 million years ago. It buried the dinosaurs beneath tons of debris, and it killed their descendants. But it is still a mystery why the dinosaurs died out. The only way to find out for sure is to discover another dinosaur skeleton that is still hiding out on the earth, and you can be the first person to see it. The fossil of this dinosaur would tell us a lot about the history of"
A2,"Piano players - when they were young Ivan Petrov Ivan was born on a farm in Russia but from the age of twelve to eighteen he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from the opera. His mother began to teach him the piano when he was six. By the age of fourteen he had his first piece to perform. This is when he took music lessons at the music school. During his studies he also made his first solo trip to Poland. He got acquainted with Polish music and started to learn to play piano by playing at the Polish school. In the early years of his studies, he played and sang in various nightclubs. However, as he was a young boy he couldn't play in front of many people at once. Therefore, he started learning the piano by playing in his room. At this time he also got a piano with a keyboard with which he could start playing. This keyboard is attached to the piano with a cable. He first studied by playing only little pieces from music books, which he wrote and drew by hand. Eventually, he started to compose his own pieces and studied the first laws of composition. From the age of nineteen he began to perform as a piano soloist at various festivals and concerts in Poland. After a while he came to Russia and started to study at the Moscow Conservatory. In the early years of his studies, he studied solo piano pieces, as well as composition and harmony in the Conservatory. In the late 1950s he received an offer for a post in the Moscow Conservatory and he moved there. During his time there he gained more experience and knowledge about music. In the early seventies he started to play together with others such as: Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Igor St"

He waited for other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. The next morning Serrano looked around the island that saved his life. He saw his ship was gone, but there was no sign it had been sunk.

In the afternoon Serrano and two young boys went back to the wreck in order to examine the damage it had suffered. Serrano saw that it was already leaking, and that it had sunk to the level of the ocean floor. He was afraid it was already too late to repair it. He and the boys then decided to get back to their island. But on the way Serrano stopped to look at the wreck. He noticed a small crescent-shaped rock poking up from the seabed. His curiosity got the best of him and he took a piece of wood from the forest and started carving it into a rock, a rock like that of his ship. A moment later he had a long wooden plank carved into a triangle. The boys were now amazed by the shape of the rock he was carving.

“It’s the shape of our ship!” exclaimed Pedro, pointing towards the triangle.

“What!” shouted Serrano. “We’ll see!”

The two boys took their sticks and were about to set off on their new adventure when Pedro noticed a slight disturbance near the triangle in the sand. The rock was now gone.

“There it is!” shouted Serrano.

“But Pedro…”

A2,"There were many big fights at that time. People fought on horses with swords in their hands. The strongest and best knight always won. 'Perhaps the new king will come to the fight' thought the Archbishop. Sir Ector went to the fight with his two sons Sir Kay and young Arthur. Sir Ector and Sir Kay went to the fight on horses. 'We have some bad news, sir,' said Arthur to his father. 'What is it?' said Sir Ector. 'There have been some bad attacks by bandits.' 'They've done all the wrong things,' said Arthur. 'They've attacked the king's horses, for example! They've robbed the castles and even burned down the royal palace. Even the knight who was the governor of the kingdom attacked the king's palace, and robbed it. All these bandits have come to his castle to kill the king, and he has no weapons! His only weapons were his swords, and they've all been taken.' 'You're right,' said Arthur. 'He did have a good sword. It was worth 1,500 marks. I had his sword when I was a boy. Perhaps I still have it. I will find it and return it to my father.' Now it was late in the evening and all the bandits were on the streets of the city with their weapons. They were waiting for the king to come back from the fight. The king was in a great hurry to return to his palace and was dressed in a grey suit with a sword at his side. They thought that he would be very angry with them if he found out that their plans had changed. The bandit leaders asked their horses to take them to the castle. When the king saw that the bandits were waiting for him, he knew that it"
A2,"A great idea! Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys who grew up in the same small Canadian town. They have always been friends and classmates. Like all their other friends they enjoy going fishing or swimming at weekends. But for the last few months they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. They spend hours on his computer repairing his laptop's broken screens, and replacing his broken DVD player. It was Peter who suggested that they make a documentary together.
Peter spent a couple of days in New York City with his friend Michael, but he couldn't finish his documentary in time, so he returned to Canada. On the other hand, Frazer stayed in New York for two whole weeks, enjoying himself. But now he's returning to his room for a couple of weeks. He still can't finish his documentary. But his parents told him that it won't be too hard for him to finish it on his own.
Peter decided to record the whole weekend on his computer. The two boys went fishing on Saturday morning. Peter was the first to arrive. He got his fishing equipment, loaded his boat with fish and set out to catch fish. They fished for nearly 2 hours, all the while recording Frazer's adventures with his camera on their laptop. Then the boys went swimming. Peter brought the DVD player with him, so he could rewind the film during his swims. But they ran out of battery, so they had to keep it on a power strip during their swims. The boys swam for almost two hours before getting tired. When they returned home, Peter went to sleep while Frazer sat at his computer and started working on their documentary.
After a long day's work, the two boys took a break in the evening, and went swimming."
A2,"'What did you talk about when the ghost was in your room?' asked Wish. 'Did he tell you about his life?' asked Sanderson. We wanted to know more about our friend's visitor. We started to believe Clayton too. It was only a story when he started and Clayton told very good stories. He had many friends in the neighborhood. There were kids who'd grown up with him and they'd even helped take care of him and his brother when they were in school. Then there were the people who were his teachers, the church where he'd been a baby, or the principal who'd fired him after he tried to hurt a student. That was back in the old days. Clayton talked about the good times and the hard times. The thing about his life though was that he never got to leave it behind. He'd been in and out of jail since he was fourteen years old, then he'd been fired for being disrespectful, then he'd been arrested for stealing something that was worth five thousand dollars. There were a lot of problems between him and the other kids in his neighborhood, but he was never a part of the fighting. That was the part everyone loved about Clayton. He'd always been nice to everybody, even when he was angry and frustrated. The police didn't think so though. They said he was always trying to take advantage of others. They had to arrest him again in 1972 because someone had stolen another million dollars. He never did find the thief though. We thought he'd never leave the past behind either. But he did leave one thing for us to find, the only thing he'd ever told us before his death. His life story. What he wrote was the first time anyone other than him had told anyone else anything about his past. It was a big"

After a night with friends in a bar Obama Sr.'s car went off the road and into a tree. He died in Kenya at the age of forty-six. The story was so shocking that there was no way Obama could forget it. He wrote it down on a piece of paper and hid it in his school locker. His classmate saw this paper and told all the students and the principal found it at the end of the day. It was a first prize. Now there is only one rule for Obama's story: ""My grandfather did not leave his home to leave me with nothing. He did not leave me with his death."" The school administration, however, found another important rule of this story: ""It should be interesting."" They agreed. ""This story should be interesting,"" was the school's first choice. It was the first choice. 
  
  
  
 Obama's second choice was: ""My first choice was: ""My grandfather was buried in the ocean in Indonesia, and my father died in Chicago."" But Obama liked this story better, and he told it to his new friends. ""They were impressed,"" Obama remembers. ""They thought I was clever. They said they will vote for me."" They went to his parents' home. Obama said to his father: ""When I grow up, I want to get a job in Chicago."" ""If you really want to do something, just take care of this money for a year and save it. Then I will take you to the city."" ""But I never had money before,"" his father told him.

A2,"I also moved some guns and other things to this bigger cave. I wanted to have guns near me when I was at my country house. I was more intelligent than 500 cannibals! Every morning I took some guns and walked about three miles to my place on the hill. There I was ready with my gun and the cannibals who invaded my territory was not a problem for me anymore because they were not coming to my house any longer. At the end I was more intelligent than those 500 cannibals.
This is my story.The big cave was great. There was no need for food. You just had to have a gun and some food. You could go far from your house, across a river, and shoot at the cannibals. At the end I was more intelligent than those cannibals.
These words have special meaning in my language. My language says that one has to be clever if one wants to be a man or woman. I am a man and I am clever, but I have other qualities as well. I am a woman who can do a lot with my hands, but also has a good intelligence. I would not be ashamed to call myself a ""woman thinker"", ""woman writer"", or even ""woman mathematician"". In my language, there is no real distinction between those categories of people and these are the only differences that people talk about. As a woman in the modern world and a woman thinker in my language, I have no need to feel embarrassed or ashamed.
As a woman, I can do things with my hands that many men cannot do. I am a painter who paints with my hands. I am a baker, but only in the morning. When I am hungry I will have some toast with"

Everyone jumped down and started playing football. When they were finished they all hugged the mayor. ""It was a pleasure to meet you all"" The mayor said to the kids. The Mayor said a prayer and went to his office. That night the mayor didn't even think about what he was going to tell the kids the next morning. But his thoughts stopped in his throat as he went to his office. He thought ""I've been locked up for 24 hours"" the mayor thought to himself. ""I hope I've locked the town up this time."" 
  
 One day in the town, when it was a hot sunny day, a black car was driving on the street. There was a man sitting in the front seat. The man looked down and was thinking a lot. Suddenly he pulled out a large clock"
A2,"Then he had a good idea. ""Maybe they'll understand this."" He looked at each of them very carefully and he spoke quietly and slowly. There's a very old man in Christmastown"" Jack said. ""He's big and round with long white hair. His clothes are red and he flies through the night sky in a big red sleigh. He brings gifts to the happy children of the city."" A very happy child, a boy and a girl, came to Jack. It was very late at night, they were so tired after the long journey. Jack invited them to stay in his house for the night. And the boy said, ""Come in, we have already enjoyed Christmas morning."" And the girl said, ""Come in, I have already enjoyed Christmas dinner!"" A very tired old man opened the door and came inside. He closed the door and felt very good as soon as he closed it. But he was very sad as soon as he saw the lights. And the very next morning he woke up in a terrible mood. All around him were the same old house that he had seen the night before. The wind blew hard and the leaves flew up into the trees. Suddenly, the old man saw a small red spot on the snow near his old sleigh and he realized that he had missed Christmas.

A2,"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today there are policemen everywhere but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. The streets and houses looked like something from a war zone and there was no law and order. The rich people stayed away from the city while the poorer people lived in the suburbs. The police in those days wore white coats, long beards and long beards did not look ugly but looked good. There was no traffic police back then so you could walk in the road for hours if you wanted. If you caused trouble the police would be quick to arrest you. They could beat you senseless and throw you into prison if you did not pay a fine. But there were no criminals then, people just worked hard all the time and wanted to forget about the problems of the day. Many of the rich people lived in mansions in the country and did not even need to go to the city. The traffic was the worst problem back then. There were no rules because people lived for their pleasures. The mayor of London called for new taxes for the poor people in the suburbs. The rich people were still very rich and enjoyed life at the city. They did not care what anyone said about them. The poor people lived in houses in the suburbs and it was very hard to get them to go to the city. The mayor did not care about the people in the country. He wanted to get rid of the traffic and was looking for new ways to make the poor people go to the city. For his part, the mayor did not believe that the poor people would pay any attention to his plans. Then"

Elliott's mom Mary took a light and then she and the boys went into the yard. ""What did you see?"" Mary asked Elliott. ""Something there"" he answered. ""Did it make a sound?"" Mary was surprised but she wasn't worried. Then Elliott remembered. ""Oooo - An orange!"" He shouted. The boys started to run towards the orange. Then they saw something moving. It was very dark, but the kids were very careful. Then they saw an old man carrying a dead bird on his shoulder. ""Oooo - An orange!"" he shouted. And the boys were scared! But they wanted to help. ""An orange?"" the old man said. ""I am taking the bird to the pet shop."" ""What are you doing?"" the boys asked. ""This is my last day working at the garden. My family doesn't give me enough money to buy a pet bird."" ""But can you take care of him? We'll buy you the pet bird tomorrow!"" ""Yes!"" the man said. Then the bird was carried off. ""We have to help him!"" said Tyler. ""Maybe it is going to be my last day here, too!"" exclaimed Elliott. Mary was surprised but at the same time she wasn't worried. ""An orange is not a dangerous thing. But I don't know how you can be sure it is a dead bird. It could be alive."" Then she went inside her house. Soon the boys ran towards the old man. ""Help! Someone is trying to steal my bird!"" they shouted. But he didn't hear them. ""Is this the bird your grandfather gave you?"" he asked."

By the end of the day he was at the river and he stopped for a drink. There were beautiful flowers near the river. 'This is a lovely place' Nunez thought. He walked along the river bank, he could hear water rushing by. It was a great way to spend the afternoon. Suddenly, Nunez saw a man sitting on a rock watching the water. He looked at Nunez and the man said 'Come on, sit down and rest a while. The sun's going to go down in an hour and I'll give you something to drink'. Nunez took a drink of the fresh water and he sat down. He knew at that moment, that he was going to have a long and happy life. The next day, Nunez looked at the river. There were a lot of pretty flowers. He sat there for a while thinking about the past and the future. Who was the man who gave him that water?It was the man who gave Nunez that drink. He was very kind and helpful. He told him to sit down by the water. Nunez accepted his invitation and took a drink from the spring. He was very tired and he went to sleep that night. The next day, he looked at the river. There were a lot of beautiful flowers. He felt happy and smiled. He wondered who the man was that had given him that drink? Was he still alive? What would he do now? Would he travel along the river or would he sit on the rocks and look at the water again? His mind kept running and running like a never-ending train.

A2,"That night it rained heavily. Mary woke up and could not sleep again. Suddenly she sat up in bed. 'It's that sound again!' she thought. She left her room and walked through the dark house. Sometimes she stopped and listened. She came to a door with a light under it. It was open! 'It's that light!' she thought. She went to the door and pushed it open. Then she walked into a room full of candles. 'That's how it happens in the books,' she thought. 'But it won't work with real life.' She closed the door and fell asleep. Next day it was very hot. She had not dressed properly for the day, so she took a cool shower. As usual, she had breakfast by herself. She then opened a lot of letters that had been left by various people. She started to read and to think about different ways of doing things. She did not know what she would decide. Suddenly she began to cry. What was wrong? She turned her head and saw a window with a beautiful view of the lake. On the mountain top there were stars that shone very brightly. She saw the lake and the mountain. She thought it was her destiny to move to this mountain. She smiled. It seemed like it would be a nice life. But she stopped her heart. There was no sound and no movement. The lights were all on. What was wrong? She walked downstairs and thought about the things she had read. It made no difference. She then thought of the two people who had written to her. She had replied to both of them with the same message. She was not at all excited. She walked back up to the house and opened the door. 'That's how it really happened,' she thought"
A2,"Parrots Perhaps you have seen these beautiful birds with their lovely colours and long tails in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil Australia and India. They usually live in large groups and because they like to eat fruit they are sometimes a problem for farmers. They can be extremely noisy but love to talk so you can listen to them. Parrots can fly and are amazing at walking on their tailed legs. They are very smart and if they see a bird with the same colour they think it is a brother or sister. This would explain why they will go to great lengths to find their ""brother"" or ""sister"". Parrots can jump very high so they can chase each other in the trees or to the other sides of the forest or even on the roof of the house. Parrots often make a good pet for children because they learn to love birds easily. What do you think of the pet?
Fishes The fishes are found in the seas, oceans and rivers. They feed mainly on marine invertebrates. They can be seen in all of the oceans and rivers. People love to catch fish because they are delicious. There are different kinds of fish in the world like tuna, salmon, mackerel, grouper and more. The best way to catch fish is to go for the sea, you can go out on the fishing boat or to catch it with a net. In the ocean, they prefer to catch sharks and turtles. They also prefer to fish for their food instead of fish bait so they use it for many years. People love eating fish so they can cook it with spices to make it taste good.

Then my friend Jeff who lives in Australia telephoned with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he's got a summer job. What's more, his job is in the city where we live. It would be a real hassle to drive all the way back and forth just to show him how much we appreciate his visit and to apologise for our lousy performance in the match. Jeff is leaving us on the 15th. I am so sad. I was hoping that he will stay longer. Maybe we can come to our place to stay and have a party and celebrate his departure but we are only an hour and a half by car. He is leaving and I am not.” “Are you sure it won’t be too cold for you to go back and forth in your car? I mean, you know, the temperature in San Remo is about 22°c.” Anna was surprised at this news but tried to be sympathetic. “It’s not far” she said. “Besides, it is a long way back just to say I’m sorry.” “It may not be a lot but it’s what I have right now.” “I wish you good luck in San Remo.” “Thanks. Good luck to you too. See you soon!”

A2,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop age 14 Last summer I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. 
  
 There was an enormous elephant in the center of the square. It seemed really happy, sitting on its huge tail, and looking very relaxed. 
  
 Then we saw two men with sticks holding the elephant's trunk to keep it on the ground, and two women holding down a rope which tied the elephant to a chair at the back of the square. When it came towards the chair the woman would drop the rope, the elephant would stand up and trot off towards the tree. 
  
 A man with a camera would take some photographs, and I remember standing there and looking at them. They were of the most incredible photographs -- every colour of the spectrum coming out in brilliant colours, and really spectacular. 
  
 The park's name was the Elephant Park. We sat in the square watching for many hours, and sometimes the two men with sticks would climb onto the elephant's back to hold it on its stomach for a while, then carry it away into the tree. We saw other elephants sitting around the square, looking peaceful, but I remember thinking at that moment that I wanted to be an elephant, just for a day. 
  
 You can read more about this trip here. 
  
 I think this was the most beautiful and exciting part of our holiday, and I've been wanting to go back to see the same elephant show since.

They had just left the safe harbor of England and a fresh breeze was blowing. The ship seemed faster, but at the back was a big pile of barrels.

A2,"Dear Sir I lost my bag on a train last week. I was on the 8.30 a.m. train to Cambridge on 10th May. It is a large blue bag and my name is written on the outside. Have you found this bag? Yours faithfully Mary Johnson Dear Ms Johnson I am pleased to tell you that we have your bag here. It was last seen on the 10th May. I sincerely hope it turns up soon. You can drop it off at the railway station at Cambridge and if it has your name on it, then it will be safe. Best wishes, Simon

I was a passenger on this train (8.30am Cambridge to London King's Cross). The front of the bag is clearly labelled, ""Mary Johnson."" I am the same Mary Johnson as the one mentioned in this question. Hope this helps!To the original user, I would suggest that the best thing you can do is to contact the local university's student office and explain what happened. They should be able to tell you whether or not your bag has actually arrived and can recommend where to drop it off. It's a good way to ensure that it won't end up lost in the shuffle.In response to the suggestion of @billyf_:

Firstly, as I mentioned in the question, a student from your university would be able to help you in such circumstances.

Secondly, I doubt the train company will be able to check on your bag for you. If they are unable to locate it, it could easily end up lost, as happens to a number of students every year.

Lastly, you should try to find the owner of the bag. This could be a student from the same university as you. If you're lucky, it might be with a student"

B1,"THE ICEHOTEL For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. To this end, a group of friends took over two abandoned houses and turned them into the Icehotel. To tell the truth, it was no more than an empty room but it was a fantastic experience that everyone would never forget. This hotel was an idea that came to the minds of friends. As they grew older and tired of travelling by car, they wanted to live again in the remote and desolate landscape of the Arctic. In order to start working on the project, they asked a friend to help them by buying the two abandoned houses and the equipment. Once these two houses were bought, the friends had to make their own plans and began to work on the hotel itself. After a while, all the work and construction was finished and this became the first Icehotel. There was no heating and no heating ducts - it was all on fire, a magnificent sight to behold. The rooms were warm and comfortable. Even the bathrooms were outstandingly clean. As for food, all food was prepared by friends, as well as some souvenirs from the Arctic. The hotel was decorated like a small town and was located on a small island in the Arctic circle. After the last guests had left, they closed the doors and gave it a good cleaning and made it completely ready to be occupied. The Icehotel was very much popular and the guests would return year after year to renew the experience.

Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. We got to the top but were not sure how to go from there. We were on a fixed line route. One of our guide's said we could just use an old, broken crampon to get to the top and then go around on the ridge, so we decided to try that. We used our crampons and the old one on the right hand side of Tower Ridge and were working along on the ridge trying to get a view back to the middle of the range. We had this view looking south over the north face. We looked in the right direction at the ridge on the left, which we were heading down on our left, and then just kept on going. A lot of the walk up was over the loose rock, or loose rock in places that was still dry. We reached the top and then climbed back down to the base of the ridge again, using the same crampons. Once we got to the base of the ridge we walked to the middle of the ridge and started taking a right and up towards the middle of the ridge, until we reached a ridge called Tower Ridge, which was a really nice flat ridge, so we took a right and started walking the ridge on the other side as far as we could and then started taking lefts again, until we reached the base of the ridge again. I was really looking forward to doing something new on Ben Nevis. I had been working on a route but I hadn't climbed since then so was looking"
B1,"Being an older student At 32 I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary although I was earning a reasonable amount of money I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. Having studied German and a little Spanish for more than eight years I was ready for a change. 
As a student you are expected to be a good listener. This requires being able to keep track of the context of the lecture and to translate it into your own words. Many students find this task very frustrating. It is better to make yourself read and listen rather than trying to find the meaning of what is said in an abstract way. 
If you are an older student then the advice I can offer you is to listen to the professor but also to try to enjoy the time you spend there.
 An excellent article. Especially the last advice about enjoying the time in the class is very wise. I am sure you have learned this for yourself, but many students don't. I'm a graduate student in a very competitive program (first year) and the material is certainly challenging, yet so far, so good. I do my best to learn, but I'm not the kind of student who wants to be spoon-fed every little thing. Instead I take my own time to understand material, and I know when to ask questions and when to let the professor explain things to me. It's been a long road so far, but I've been able to learn more than I expected. 
I would love to see how other students respond to this article. Let me know if you have any thoughts or comments. Cheers! 
 Interesting article. As"
B1,"No Title When I injured my back I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. As a result, I organised a female only 5k race. After a long period of recovery and rehabilitation I have now been running for 6 months and it feels great to be back with my team on the streets.I've had back surgery and was on crutches for six months. In this time I was unable to do any sort of sport. But this all changed when I was out running with a group of women who I had started running with when they were walking on crutches. They taught me how much fun it is to run and how much more exciting the sport is with someone who is also getting out and running. Since then I have been out running almost every day with a small group of women who I have developed an amazing bond with. I'm so excited to be back out there running with the group. It's made me more confident and I'm excited about the challenges I've set for myself to run for as long as I can.
I've been out running for a little over 3 years now and it feels like it's just come out of nowhere. I was in the process of running a half marathon when I injured my back. I had been injured a few times before but this really shocked me. After the race I went out running with friends and we all shared a beer, all of us trying to get well as fast as we could. We decided to set up a local running club and I am really proud of what we did.

B1,"Grass Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are over 9000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. In most cases, the grassland supports more biodiversity than any other ecosystem on the planet.
Why Grass is so successful?
1. Grassgrass is a perennial plant that can grow for years. This makes grasses an excellent habitat for wildlife. Grasslands allow animals to move from forest to forest to live their lives.
2. Grass is able to live in extreme temperatures due to the way that it is able to regulate its temperature. The grass will retain its natural green color even in freezing conditions.
3. Grass is highly resistant to diseases. This reduces its potential to spread the disease.
Grass has many health benefits. The grass has anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties. Grass is good for your hair and skin. Grass is also good for you skin. Grass is also known to be good for your health.

The most effective method of growing grass is by using synthetic grass.
If you want to cultivate grass you must know the proper methods. Grass has to be cultivated with manure. You should also know how to use fertilizer to make the grass grow.
4. Grass is able to support a wide variety of living organisms. This includes both plants and fungi. Fungi are used as food for other living organisms. Both plant and fungi are able to support a large number of animals.

The most important part of grass is that it is able to support grass for several years.
5. Grass is good for the soil. It will"
B1,"Maria Mutola In 1988 Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl in an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. 'We won' she said. 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.' The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha who had encouraged other African athletes learnt about Maria. 'He asked me to join his team,' said Maria. 'We won again.' Jose showed Maria around a football ground near his house. Maria was impressed. 'But there were two things wrong. One, the goal posts were made of wood instead of metal. And two, Jose wouldn't stop laughing at our triumphs. ""That's what I get for having to deal with a girl.""' But Jose was pleased. 'Maria, I've made a decision,"" he said. 'Now you can join my team. It's not just football. We will get you a good job too.' And so Maria was a member of the Craveirinha football team. Soon she was coaching her team too. 'Now I am in charge of the women's section,' she said. 'And I am working very hard to get women playing as often as men.' 'But I can't stop laughing at our triumphs,' continued Maria. 'It's what I get for having to deal with a girl. I can't help laughing at our successes.' 'It's what I get for having to deal with a girl.' But it is not just the girls who get Maria laughing. A few years ago, she and her husband opened a business which does exactly what it says on the tin. 'We specialise in sending Christmas cards with funny illustrations to the elderly,' said Maria. 'And it's a great business. And every time I see someone sending me a card with my husband"
B1,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival an annual nine-day event. The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station.

Thousands of tourists from around the world come to see the hundreds of colourful balloons and colourful balloon-divers which go up in the hot sun for the three days of the festival. It is one of the world's most spectacular festivals. The festival started out as an annual event organised by the radio station and has become an important annual event in Albuquerque.

There are over 900 balloon floats in the festival. Over the years some of these floats have become famous. They take part in the festival, often with many more balloons than originally intended. Some of the famous balloons include a British rocket called the 'Lunar Orbiter' the 'Lunar-V' the 'Raptor' the 'SV-20' and a number of others. Many of the balloons do not release their cargo until the morning after the festival, when the festival ends. The Festival starts each day around sunset and does not end until the following morning. Over the years, there has been many records broken in the festival. For example: The balloons of the 'Lunar Orbiter' are the heaviest on the planet. For over 15 years, they have been held to this record.  Balloonists who are also"

B1,"THE ROCKIES The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America. They start in the North-west but lie only a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies but the best way to see them is to travel by train. The most famous train line across the Rockies is the Rocky Mountain Express. It runs a series of steam locomotives through the forests and mountains with scenic stops along the way. A regular steam train journey across the Rockies is ideal for seeing wildlife such as elk and moose, but there are no motorised trains so only the occasional passenger trains pass. The Rocky Mountain Express has been operating since the 1950's and has been called one of the most scenic rail journeys in the world. It is always a joy to travel on the trains and is worth booking as there are often last minute changes of travel dates available and the ticket prices are competitive. The trains are all operated by Northern Canada Railroad and offer luxury accommodation for overnight stays. The food is great especially the ice cream and pastries that are served at the steam stations. The train itself is pretty cool as the steam trains are steam powered. It is very noisy but worth it for the scenery and the food. If you have more time you can see the train at one of the stops, but you will have to travel around the mountains for several hours. The Rocky Mountain Express is one of the most popular ways to travel across the Rockies.

B1,"Little Chefs For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.
“I have always loved cooking and since my wife died I have cooked more and more, it gives me something to talk about. I hope I can help children to feel closer to their mothers. Cooking is great therapy for all parents, if it can help you to cope with the pain of the loss of a child I think it can help others. In addition, it is a healthy way of losing weight – commented one mother.
Although Chefs For is a registered charity, the group has only recently received its certificate of charitable acceptance, but it has always had people coming from all over the world.
“My family come from many different countries but this group helps me to meet new people and create new memories. I really hope they will grow to be successful chefs like the people I admire most in the world: Tony Bourdain and Wolfgang Puck,” concluded one participant.
Chefs For is a voluntary initiative of The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in partnership with the London Metropolitan University, the London College of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LCHTM) and the British Heart Foundation (BHF). Since its launch the group has been operating in seven locations in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Leeds, Glasgow and Reading. The group has more than 1,000 children currently involved and in total, 30 courses are held throughout the UK each week. For more information on the project please visit www.ChefsFor."
B1,"Detective-Inspector Cornish and Chief-Inspector Craddock were discussing the murder at the local police station. 'Mrs Bantry said that Marina Gregg had a ""frozen look""' said Cornish. 'Did she see someone on the stairs? There were two people from America - Ardwyck Fenn and Lola Brewster a film star. Fenn had a red sweater on, and Brewster was wearing a blue sweater, and both of them were carrying large umbrellas. She was horrified when she saw that the murderers had murdered Brewster.' 'So far you've got a good start, Inspector, but we might need to consider the possibility of some local interference. I mean, it's not like two murderers from a distant country would come down to the seaside town in search of a famous actress.' 'Exactly. I'm afraid the fact that the police have no witnesses to the murder - nobody came to see Fenn or Brewster after they left - might make us a bit narrow-minded.' 'It's so weird,' remarked Inspector Clancey. 'Even in Scotland you have to know your local population!' 'I agree,' said Inspector Cornish, 'but we may need to talk with Mrs Bantry and Ardwyck Fenn to be absolutely sure that they didn't commit the crime. They were both very suspicious.' 'They did see something, though,' said Chief-Inspector Craddock. 'Ardwyck Fenn said the stairs were very dusty, so he thought that someone had been up there. Fenn said that when he looked through the window to see how the stars were doing, it seemed like nobody was there. Then Fenn said he saw someone with an umbrella. And, in fact, Lola Brewster said the same thing. So we're really getting into"
B1,"A few days after this Virginia and her young admirer went out riding in the fields. But a tree tore her riding skirt very badly and when they got home she went up the back stairs to mend it. She was running past the half-open door of one of the rooms when she saw someone inside. She knew the name of the man by sight, for his dress was white, long and very low cut. He was riding on a small horse. When she called his name, he turned around and looked at her. Then he went in the house and shut the door. She felt scared and ran upstairs to the second floor. Then she called his name and got no answer. She called again but no answer. She was very worried, so she ran downstairs and knocked on the door. The man looked out through the window and waved at her. When he saw that she was very frightened, he offered her tea. Then he called her to a table and they talked. There was no one else in the room but them. She told him she was a widow and that she used to ride in the fields. He said he came to see if she wanted to go riding with him. Virginia said she would be delighted. That night she put on her riding costume and went out. She was very excited. She was riding a big, sleek horse. She was also wearing a big dress that showed her leg for a long way. Then she suddenly came to a stop and noticed the man. He was looking at her, but she did not notice him. When he got off his horse and approached her, she started to run away, but he chased her and grabbed her and she escaped his clutches.

B1,"Winter Driving Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow waiting to send you off the road.

This is why you should learn how to drive. This way you can drive safely and efficiently and you can be free to enjoy the holiday season with your loved ones.
1. Read and practice your safe driving laws.: The first step in learning to drive safely is reading the laws of your state. Some states require you to have a license before you can take the driving test. If this is your first time driving, you'll need to read the instruction manual you got when you first obtained your learner's permit. The manual should have specific information about driving in your area, as well as where you're allowed to practice.

You should learn how to drive in a safe and stable environment.
Your state may also offer to help you get your license if you pass the driving test with only two mistakes on your license.
2. Get experience with different types of vehicles.: You should learn how to drive in the type of vehicles that are most appropriate for where you live. The best way to practice in order to master all types of vehicles is by driving some of them. If you choose a vehicle from a list of vehicles, then you're not really learning the skill of driving.

You might be able to practice driving with a car from your family's car lot if you're the only driver. This way, you'll learn the difference between manual and automatic transmissions, as well as how to operate the clutch.

B1,"The next day Emma was pleased to see a lot of snow outside. This was a good thing because it meant she could not go to church and see Mr Elton or go to visit Harriet and none of them could meet. The snow stayed for several days after Christmas and the only visitor to Hartfield was Mr Knightley. The days after Christmas and the first week in February were cold and snowy. Emma kept on writing her letters and Mr Knightley would be too busy with his own work to write them and so he would not see them. Emma hoped that Mr Knightley would like the new book and he would be surprised that his son was so clever and interested in English literature. Emma looked at the calendar and saw that it was February 2nd and that Mr Knightley would be back on the 3rd. Emma was looking forward to seeing him again and she wondered if there would be any Christmas gifts for Mr Knightley to bring to Emma to make up for last year. Emma looked out of the window and saw that the sun was shining and the snow was melting. It was a beautiful day and she felt she would like to spend the day outside. Emma’s sister, Harriet, was also looking forward to seeing Mr Knightley again after all this time. It was the last day of the winter and the weather was pleasant.

There have been a few changes since the last CD with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums. The band have released the first single from the new album ‘Tallinn’ which features a guest appearance by ex Black Sabbath bassist Ozzy Osbourne. Here again was recorded with Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler at the Iommi Sound Studios in Luton. I have been looking forward to this album all year. I have not heard the new drummer but I remember the last two members well. The album will come out in September next year.

‘Tallinn’ features Ozzy Osbourne on lead vocals and is the first single from the new album, ‘Here Again’, which will be released on September 9.
‘Tallinn’, a dark, sombre track, opens with Osbourne, on his trademark snare drum, strumming with a raw passion.
‘It starts as a normal song,’ says guitarist and drummer Tom Wilcott, ‘which is a great thing about bands: sometimes you can get away with starting a song and leaving it there, not realising you’ve started a song.

B1,"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST Hypatia was born in Alexandria in Egypt in 370 A.D. For many centuries she was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books. Hypatia's father was director of Alexandria University and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual as most women then had few opportunities to study. Her father encouraged her and she was taught to love science. Hypatia was so inspired by the discoveries of Johannes Kepler, that she wrote a book explaining his theories. In 384 she graduated from the university, passing the test for medical doctors. She studied at Paris under Jean-Baptiste Colbert who was a major figure of the Enlightenment. She became a great admirer of Galileo when she learned about his work. Hypatia's views on Galileo were not popular when they were expressed publicly, and she was threatened. She was told that her views were 'false'. In 415 A.D. she married the philosopher Hermocrates. The couple had seven children and were also the first couple to welcome a litter of girls into the world, which led to one of the most famous names in medicine - Hypatia. Hypatia was a great influence on men who worked at the university, many of whom became scholars and physicians. Her husband was a philosopher who helped to reform and modernize the philosophy of medicine. When she passed away in 496, at the age of 66, her scientific work was completed. Many of the discoveries made by her are still used today, including the invention of the syringe, and the first operation on a heart. 
  
 The story of Hypatia begins in the city of Alexandria, where she studied medicine. Her father was a leading figure in the medical profession and supported his daughter by encouraging her and teaching her to study the sciences"
B1,"Joining the Kirov Ballet I’m Nathalie. Last year I was one of the youngest foreign students ever to join the Kirov’s ballet school in St Petersburg Russia. At my first ballet class I was nervous as I didn’t know anyone. Everyone gathered round asking me questions all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. From that moment I felt at home in the ballet world.
I’ve always loved dancing. At my first class I had the opportunity to be part of a ballet company, dance on stage for the first time and work with famous dancers. I also met Russian ballet master Yuri Bezrukov who taught me the classical Russian ballet. The ballet world in my country is huge and full of opportunities. Now, I enjoy dancing with my local Kirov Ballet! I’m now in the final year of my course, doing both dance and drama. I try to take part in competitions and have the chance to travel to Moscow to work with Yuri Bezrukov.
At the end of my second year in the Kirov Ballet, I will have to make an important decision. I plan to continue my dancing career, continue my course and become a ballet dancer. I believe this will give me the chance to be part of the future of Kirov Ballet. And the ballet world will always be my second home. It all started for me in the first ballet class. I can’t wait to dance my way through life!

B1,"Norwich Norwich the capital of the part of Britain known as East Anglia has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years. It began as a small village beside the River Wensum. At the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 it had grown to become one of the largest towns in England. The population quickly increased, with much of the growth coming in the period of the English Industrial Revolution. By the time of the Second World War, the town had become an important port, with the population growing rapidly, mainly through immigration. It remains a popular destination for tourists. Norwich has two ancient streets named after Norman kings: North Street for King Edward I and South Street for King William the Conqueror. The city’s old market place, which was originally rebuilt during the Renaissance, now houses an impressive civic palace. Other popular attractions include the famous King’s Theatre which has two operas performed each year, as well as the city’s cathedral, St. Paul’s, which has a unique style of its own. The cathedral is a Grade II listed building. Other museums and attractions include the Norwich History Museum, where visitors can learn about Norwich’s rich history and explore a replica of the city’s medieval market place.

B1,"Sharks  Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks can be very aggressive and can even bite without intending to do so. Sharks are known for their beautiful colors and bright patterns. Sharks do not have jaws like other animals so their eyes are very good in detecting other living things. Sharks are carnivorous and they eat small animals like fish and squid, but they are also tolerant to small animals and large animals like dolphins, seals, whales and corals. Sharks have sharp teeth and very long, powerful and powerful jaws. It is often said that if you are bitten by a shark, you will die as quickly as you blink. It is said that the death of a human is instantaneous in most shark attacks. Because of this, people who are not prepared for such a situation are more likely to be killed. Shark attacks are very rare in most places.

B1,"CARTOON FILMS Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something you can make it move on the cinema screen. The use of new ideas and advanced computer programs means that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. So they turned into boring and predictable characters, without emotions. This was the moment when people started to turn away from old values and to create new ones. Today people of all ages can enjoy cartoons. Cartoon film is a form of entertainment that has the ability to entertain all ages.
  
 The art of animation, the skill of creators and the ability of computer programs has created this new medium of entertainment.
  
 The following films were made by the beginning of the 1970s in order to break this trend and change the way people see animated films. They have all become classic.
  
 1. THE BEATLES - ""It's Only Rock And Roll""
  
 The first animated film starring The Beatles was released in July of that year in Britain and in August in the United States. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr play a rock band. They have just released their first album and are struggling financially. They decide to quit playing and take care of themselves. The film is based on a musical idea of their.
  
 It is a very detailed film. It does not allow the audience to make fun of The Beatles. It shows the difficulty of The Beatles to become successful.
  
 2. G.I. Joe - ""G.I. JOE: The Rise And Fall Of The Cobra""
  
 In August 1975, the second animated film based on the G.I."
B1,"No Title The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six"" says Margaret Porter a violinist and music teacher. ""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret who lives in London prefers to take pupils at three and four although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. There's nothing wrong with listening to music at a young age! According to music researcher John Wood, musical education should begin before the age of three and continues until the age of eight. You don't want to put a child off playing for life by making them start too late. A well-educated society is one which is more likely to be able to make informed choices on what music they like. An early start not only means less risk of illness but also less of an interest in something that will take too much of their attention. Music can be a life-long experience if you choose wisely and are willing to go through the hard work it takes. Music lessons are more expensive than most people think - especially if you find the right teacher. But a little investment will pay itself off many times over in the future if you are serious about musical learning. Start by doing a bit of research before signing up with a teacher. Research their qualifications and how much they charge. Read testimonials from pupils and parents of pupils. Speak to other people who have taken lessons. Find a teacher who has done at least two years of study or have specialised in older pupils. This gives you the best chance of learning a good level of music and building your confidence. There's a great deal you can learn about music - how it's played, when and how it was created and the different styles that have developed. Also learn about how it's influenced by religion, culture and economics. One of the best"

B1,"SAMUEL PEPYS The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting description of everyday life in England between 1660 and 1669. Pepys writes about important news stories of the time like disease an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames and the Great Fire of London. He also writes about small local happenings, which often don´t interest everyone at the time. These diary entries are an incredible source of information about everyday life in London at the time. This is a great resource for students as it gives information on many interesting topics such as the wars with Scotland and France, the Great Fire, and the Great Plague. The entries of the diary also contain a lot of interesting information about the British Isles, which we can study in the context of today´s history. A useful part of the diary is the letters that Pepys wrote to his friends during the time, which provide a great picture of life in England at that time. The diary entries are full of anecdotes which, as with all interesting accounts, also provide an insight into everyday life in English at that time. This is particularly true of the entries from the summer of 1664. The entries give a perfect example of what Pepys wrote during the Great War as it was a much more serious time in England. The entries also provide an insight into the attitudes of ordinary people towards the events at that time. They also give a great look into the social environment in England during the time. This diary is a perfect resource for English Language and Literature students studying Great Britain at the time. It´s a great way to understand British life during the period and gain a greater understanding of how our country came to be. The entries also make for an interesting reading for historians.This diary is a great way"
B1,"The History of Shoes In the past importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today but other materials such as silk plastic or cotton are also popular depending on what is in fashion. The first modern shoes or sandals were developed by 1877 when Lord Edward Frederick Dormer patented the ""Dormer sandal"". He then sold them in the USA, where they quickly became popular. By 1885 all men had them as they were very practical and made walking less painful. The style was designed to be used both in indoor and outdoor activities. The most famous designer of men's sandals in the USA is William Randolph Hearst, also known as ""America's most famous man."" In this case the man is wearing a Dormer Sandal made of leather (see below). Dormer's patent showed an innovative method for cushioning. He used a cloth with a layer of cloths held together by adhesive tape to form a flexible mass for use as a shoe sole. By the end of the century, the majority of men were wearing sandals, known today as men's slip-ons, also known as ""slip-on"". In the early 20th century women started to wear sandals also. The design of a women's slipper differed from that of a men's slipper; instead of being strapped and fixed at the front, women wore them more loose or with straps at the back. By the 1930s women were wearing them even more than men. The style became known as the ""girly"" slipper and often incorporated accessories like bracelets and chokers. By the 1940s the slipper style had become more mainstream"
B1,"The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the ‘famous Ghan’ which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known above all for being late. Despite being almost 2000 kilometres long, it is said the train has yet to arrive. So where is it?
1. It is a mystery that has been around for a century at least. The theory is that the Ghan train has yet to cross the Australian continent. It makes sense. The desert is virtually all over Australia, so there must be some type of desert in every state of Australia. Plus, the desert is often difficult to see in the heat of Australia, unless you know what you’re looking for. And even then, you wouldn’t know it is there, except maybe if you had been there.
For example, during the Ghan train’s original run between Darwin in the north and Adelaide in the south from 1904 to 1912, the deserts of the Great Dividing Range could not be seen from Darwin. Only after a change in the train’s route in April 1912 did the Great Dividing Range and the Nullarbor Plain finally start to appear in the landscape.
2. When it came to moving from Darwin to Adelaide, the train had no issues at all, because it was able to travel in complete darkness. Since the desert is dark, it was not difficult at all for the train to travel, but it did take longer. The time was so long it has been said the train was late. During this time, the Ghan Train only had 24 hours to get from Darwin to Adelaide on the north east"
B1,"Henry Ford Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863 but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen he began work as a mechanic and in 1893 he built his first car. After he had driven it 1500 kilometres he sold it and built two bigger cars. After that he started to build other vehicles. In 1901 he bought the General Motors Corporation and named it in honor of his grandfather, Henry Ford. In 1913 he founded the International Motors Company and in 1925 became the largest car producer in the world with 500,000 cars produced that year. In 1936 he founded the Dearborn Automobile Company. On 13 October 1949 he died at age 94. John D. Rockefeller John D. Rockefeller was the third richest man of the 20th century, worth $4,740,000,000 by 2007. He started to collect stocks as early as 1874 and in 1892 began to buy all the companies under one name, Rockefeller. In 1896 he built the first oil refinery and in 1902 he built the electric lighting. In 1910 he built a railroad. After 1901 he took over the Chrysler Corporation. He died on June 3, 1931. John D. Rockefeller John D. Rockefeller was born on 3 June 1869 in New Rochelle, New York. He did not like money very much and did not work for long. In 1890 he sold all the stocks, which gave him $1,500,000 and he founded Standard Oil of New Jersey. In 1896 he founded the Rockefeller Oil Company. After 1901 he took over the Chrysler Corporation.

B1,"Atlantic College Last week I went to visit Atlantic College an excellent private college in Wales. Unusually it gives young people much needed experience of life outside the classroom as well as the opportunity to study for their exams. The students who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world spend the morning studying. The rest of the time they go out and have fun and learn about many things such as the Welsh language, Celtic culture, music, cinema and many other things. It is run by a Catholic Church which is very welcoming and helpful. The food is always tasty and it is well run. I must say the education is very good. It is run like a normal school so the pupils have teachers who teach them the subjects rather than doing it from book. As with most English schools the students speak English fluently. Some say they speak more English than their families. They are very respectful and helpful and they get on very well with each other. I think there is a long way to go and there is a need to make sure that this type of school does not close in the near future. Atlantic College I have always wanted to go there because it sounds so interesting. If you decide to visit this beautiful and historic college you should do so. It will enrich your life and make you enjoy your time even more. I recommend this institution highly.Atlantic College Last week I went to visit Atlantic College an excellent private college in Wales.

B1,"No Title A month ago I had no idea that on a Saturday afternoon in November I'd be hanging 30 metres above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me and realised why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. It was our first time here, and we were keen to make the most of it. I was the senior member of the group, so I was instructed to start climbing on the first climbing wall. But I hadn't intended to stay there long — I only felt up to trying some short ascents, before I decided to try a new route I'd seen in a film.  
  
 It was an easy climb, and I enjoyed it. But I was so cold. I decided I wouldn't stay too long that night. So I set off on the long climb back down to the centre of the Centre. It was very easy going, and I made good progress back down. A few times I had to wait for someone to catch up, but eventually, after about five hours of climbing, I arrived back at the Activity Centre.  
  
 I'm sure climbing is a sport that you can take up at a whim. But it's also a sport where you need to be prepared and mentally prepared, both mentally and physically, to do long climbs that take an hour, or longer. You need to have the right equipment and training. That's why the group that's running the Centre are great. They have an experienced climbing guide who knows all the routes, and it's great for people to talk to him, because it's easy for him to answer any questions you might have.  
  
 I came here because I wanted to"
B1,"Letter to the Newport Evening News On Saturday afternoon I left my handbag on the bus. In it were my cheque book address book and my purse which contained about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realised what I had done it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old I was a long way from home and I was quite worried. Thankfully my bus driver spotted it. I said, ""I've left my handbag on the bus, please help me get it to the office."" He said he would and took me to the office. When I got there the lady at the reception desk said the handbag had gone. She said a colleague had spotted it in a cupboard in the ladies' toilets. When I got there, there was not a word of praise for the driver. He would have made such a difference. What I did do, apart from going round to where I left the handbag, was to call and tell the driver how glad I was that he had seen my bag. I told him that I would not have been so happy had he not. And, what do you know, it turns out that he had. If you leave your bag on a bus as I did, I can't recommend enough that you call your bus company and remind them of the importance of putting bags on the bus. It won't cost anything to do so.Dear Editor, I was on the bus today and it took me a long time to locate my bag. I didn't have a problem, as it turned out, though. The driver was pleased to see me and even called to say so.
My bag is a large duffel bag. I always keep my purse with me in case I want to get something to eat or drink, etc., and I always check my bag before I get on"

Dancing at the Oscars A report by Chris Mathers It was a record setting crowd of 120 000 people last night at the star studded Oscars. The best part of the evening was when Lady Gaga paid tribute to Elton John with an amazing performance and after that the most famous person of them all - Oprah Winfrey.

Shopping for furniture How can I buy the best dress for the best prom? A question I am asked all the time. The best dress for the prom is very personal. You want to look cute, not awkward. But then it is so hard to know what dress to buy for a prom. You have to check if there is a dress code, what is the dress size. Also you have to remember that a prom should be a time to have fun and have a good time, not a time to buy a dress.
The other thing you have to consider is your date, or you should choose a date who is going to enjoy the prom. The important thing is to have fun and enjoy the prom with your friends. All the best wishes for your prom. I hope you enjoy it.

B1,"The Eden Project Since it opened the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK’s most popular tourist attractions. At first sight the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. Here are some of the most interesting features of the new attraction including the Eden Garden, the World’s Biggest Tree, the ‘Eden of the North’, the ‘Eden of the South’ and the spectacular World Fountains. The World’s Biggest Tree The new attraction features three ‘super trees’ that are almost 9 metres in circumference. The trees have been created using wood taken from trees in the UK and the USA. The trees are called ‘Bentley’, ‘Brittany’ and ‘Jude’ and form part of the Eden Project’s effort to restore forest areas. The tallest ‘Bentley’ is nearly 5 metres in diameter and stands 30 metres high. It is a shade of pale yellow and has enormous trunks which bend at the knees. A giant sequoia from the US grows in the middle. This is the largest of all the trees, nearly 2 metres high and stretching almost to the top of the giant ‘branch’ at the top of the tree. In total there are five giant trees. The ‘Jude’ tree is over 10 metres in diameter and has five main trunks. It was brought from the West Indies in 1978 and planted in one of the biospheres in the centre. It is planted in a new garden, the ‘Gardening and the Garden God’ that"

B1,"JAZZ By Katie Atkins aged 14 I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools – and our band won! Each band had their own costumes ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly-coloured T-shirts. The competition started at 12, and continued right until closing time. And then we were allowed to sit down and have lunch and take a moment to reflect. As my band played one of the best songs I have ever heard, I started to think about what made me love my trumpet. I started thinking about what brought me out of bed in the morning to practise. It was my passion. I have no idea why. All I know is that I love it. And now I want to pass that passion on to others. I want to encourage others in their passion for music. I want to show them the joy and happiness I had in my own love of playing music. I want to tell them, if you love it that much, then why not teach it to someone else? Why do we let other people decide our passion for something? Music is something that transcends time. It transcends language. It transcends space. It has the power to heal and bring people together. Why? Because music is universal. It connects people through music. This is why I want to pass my passion onto other people. It will mean that many of the others I met in that competition will have a band and become great musicians, playing music with passion, enthusiasm and dedication. And I won’t be there to see their brilliance! I will be watching them play from a distance, through my computer! I will be on a different planet! For some reason, I never felt that way about"

B1,"San Francisco San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it was discovered by land rather than by sea. The first known shipwreck on the Bay was off of Point Reyes on the day after Christmas 1786. The bay soon became the main entry point for trade between the Americas and Europe. Over the next hundred years, hundreds of ships would be lost at San Francisco, the most notable being “The Beagle” lost in 1851. The town quickly grew with the ships that sailed down the bay to exchange cargo with ships from Europe. In 1833 San Francisco became the first town west of the Mississippi to hold a permanent post office. By 1850 the population of the bay was estimated at 45,000. The most notable feature of the town is the Golden Gate Bridge which opened in 1849. A series of earthquakes in the 1860s led to much damage, but there was sufficient interest to raise funds to repair the damage. In the 1880s the city was booming with the opening of the San Francisco–Oakland International Airport. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake killed 547 and destroyed much of the city. During the Second World War, between 1942 and 1946 the city saw considerable construction of military installations. Many of them are now history with the city no longer able to support the type of growth it experienced in the past. Today the population of the city is less than two million, compared to a population of 5.5 million in 1950. Many new buildings have been constructed since the earthquake which include the Golden Gate National Parks. The Bay Area is often referred to as the “Golden Gate"

I’d only ever acted at school but I'd loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her.
It was fantastic that they picked me. I was really nervous because I didn't know if I'd be good or not but the director took great care of me and I ended up playing her older sister. It was really lovely because the girls on set loved playing the character they were acting alongside me for. It was such a huge privilege to be playing a character as famous as Caroline. I remember being so excited at school. I'd been to a couple of her birthday parties and I'd read the book and seen the movie, but I never expected to spend some of my first year at university filming The Finnegans.

B1,"Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car recycling wine bottles not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out. I want to be clear about one thing right from the start - it wasn't my idea to become the BBC's ethical man.
The BBC commissioned me after a BBC team in the UK had spoken to thousands of you, their viewers, about ethical living. I wanted to write about it, and make a short documentary, so I asked my producer to come up with some ideas to get me started. She came up with the idea of setting up an ethical man himself in London. I then went on an ethical journey of discovery.
When I first visited the BBC's Ethical Living offices in London I was a bit thrown by the idea of being in the same building as the Ethical Man. For most people, ethics is so distant from their day-to-day experiences that it was easy to think of a man who is simply a fictional character played by Terry Jones. I soon realised that the ethical man is just as ordinary and as human as you and me. He's just as vulnerable and dependent on us as we are.
He uses the same shopping habits as you and me. The more I found out about ethical living, the more I realised that you couldn't make any assumptions about the way he lives his life.
He might buy a cheap, plastic bottle of wine, but that's because he believes a glass is superior. He might look after his family by driving a low-emission car, but he's still using petrol.
Ethical Living can't stop us from buying a plastic bag from a supermarket, but we can look at the packaging on it. We can choose to buy"
B1,"We went to the park. We knew of fifty-two sons in prison. We made a circle of lights one for each son. People stopped to look at the dancing lights and came to ask about our campaign. By the time it was dark our camp had grown to more than fifty women. Every night we stayed up singing until it was time to sleep. Then we would stand around the fire and tell the stories that would become our songs.
Now the prison where we’d once been has been emptied. The guards have been told to leave and we have taken our places in the streets. We sing again and again to the rhythm of the city, to the melody of song that we wrote and sang together.
On the fourth night of our camp we went back into the darkness of the forest and sang our song again.

It’s only with song that we can remember the truth.
And there will be one more night to sing our song.
When the prisons come to a close,
When the children return to the street,
It will be with song that we can find peace.
For I have heard a song, like one we’ve sang before.
We’ll all remember those things.
We’ll all find joy in the things that were,
Those things that made us strong,
The things that made us the people that we are.
I believe we’ll remember our song with pride.
Because when it’s dark outside and everyone is alone,
Just imagine the feeling
When you’re on the streets of your own town.
There we will hear our song and know that even on our darkest nights
We’ll keep remembering, we�"

B1,"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod which means 'far distant place'. The town grew rapidly and Iditarod was built on an old log building. A town that would be known for more than just its race. A large number of people came to watch the race in the stadium that is now called ""Sarcastic Stadium"". This is where you can watch the race and listen to the commentary. There is a little village called ""Nordstrom"" where there is an ice cream shop. We all have our favourite foods and I believe Iditarod is a place where you can experience most of them. It's been called the most polarised race on earth. That is because some people love it, and they will come and travel great distances to see the Iditarod. Others do not want it. Some think it is too cold and don't care about it. It's a race we all love to watch but for different reasons. The Iditarod is a race that has lasted for many years, and it has never been cancelled. Despite many challenges, the Iditarod is the longest running musher race in the world. It is the last great race on earth. You can see an old tradition during the Iditarod. When you travel to the race, you will see a big number of mushers. They are all mushers who have passed before you. These guys have gone the distance, and there are not many more who can. The last two were Sifataxi (which means 'blessed one')"
B1,"No Title When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976 my only object was to earn enough to feed my children. Today 'The Body Shop' is an international company rapidly growing all around the world. In the years since we began I have learned a lot.  The beauty of working for the company is that you get the chance to grow together with it!  My son joined me in 1998 and the management has since then taken a lot of interest in our business.  This has been the best investment they have ever made!
I have learned to appreciate and value the quality of the products, the people and the experience. To me, this company is a joy! It is the only one I would rather work for than my own. 
I am passionate about customer service and, as a result, have a lot of respect for each person I come into contact with.
Our success, as well as that of 'The Body Shop', has been a team effort. I am proud of the progress we have made and am sure the future will be exciting for all of us.
The 'Body Shop' is the business that I love and would recommend to any and everyone.

B1,"Rock Band Two years agoour 14-year-old s onBen asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At firstwe were very much against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time' Ben argued ’and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end we gave in. It was for the best, because the drums we got - the original set with the rubber bands - don't only make a perfect noise for Ben, but are also perfect for him. Our son plays in a band, but we've never seen him play with a real drummer. He has a microphone, sure, and we have a beat-program - but the drums in Rock Band are almost like toys - you're meant to use them, but they're not meant to be played with. Now Ben can't stop playing - he's hooked. He loves it more than he loves his friends. In Rock Band our son can play any beat we write - and he can play along with the songs he loves. There are times when we wish he had an instrument other than the drums - but the drums are all he needs - and it seems to be all he ever really wanted from life. I can't describe to you how happy I am that my son has found something that helps him relax and be at peace with the world - that we are so lucky to have these wonderful toys to give him. I'd rather have him as a son than as a computer game user.""Two years ago, our 14-year-old son Ben asked us for a set of drums for his birthday.

B1,"Free-diving in the Caribbean Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving the sport in which competitors reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air. In 2003 Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath and come back up to the top without help. On April 19, 2010, Streeter held the world record for breaking the 100-metre barrier diving 110 metres using a special breathing apparatus that allowed her to stay underwater for over 10 seconds, with a breath hold of 5.4 seconds. Streeter completed a similar dive in 2011 and a longer dive (with a breath hold of 5.9 seconds) at the same dive site. Streeter currently holds the world record for the longest free-dive ever carried out (131.9 metres). 
  
 Streeter's first attempt to break the 100m barrier in free-diving was made on January 31, 2004, at the Florida Keys in the United States. 
  
 Streeter started at 100m when she was 13 years old and when she reached her 14th birthday she was certified by the Florida Keys Dive Club. Streeter went on to dive as deep as 80m before being certified to dive to 100m in the Bahamas. Streeter dove to 78m in 2005 before breaking the mark in 2007. 
  
 Streeter was the first person to hold her breath while diving over 100m into the sea in the Bahamas with a 1-month preparation. During this period she went through a 10-day training programme that consisted of three types of training: body weight, weights and swimming. 
  
 Streeter has since held four world records at the 100m barrier. She holds the record for the fastest freedive"
B1,"ZOOS People began to keep animals in zoos over 3000 years ago when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally. Zoos have a role to play in protecting endangered species.

Zoos are a way of protecting an endangered animal by showing it to people who will support its conservation.

Zoos show animals their natural environment without artificial lighting and noise. Zoos also allow humans to see the animal without interference. In addition, zoo owners are committed to the conservation of the animals.

Zoos teach people about the importance of wildlife. Zoos show them how to help the animals.

In addition, zoos show people how animals can help humans with their care.

Zoos can also help people decide whether they would like to have a pet animal.

It is important for people to know the importance of animals, so they are able to help them. Zoos show them to help them in understanding how to help.

In addition, zoos show people the importance of caring for wild life.

Some people are also afraid of going to the zoo to see animals, but this can be overcome.
Zoos have become a necessary part of our society.

How do you feel about zoos?Zoos make humans aware of the importance of animals in their own lives.
People who visit zoos can make an informed decision about whether they want to get a pet animal or not.
In addition, people can see how animals are raised to show the public how important animals are for the future of the planet.

B1,"MONEY What is money? The pound the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book a huge bag of sweets or a couple of cinema tickets. So where does this money come from? It's all from taxes. You need to pay income tax and VAT. Income tax is the tax on every penny you make. VAT is the tax on every penny you spend. Every penny I earn goes into these coffers, which then distribute the money to the government. This is how it works. In order for this money to stay in your pocket you need to be paying tax to the government. That's a lot of money. £50,000 every year is not much. But it keeps money in the coffers, the government then can pay the wages of the government or make the roads or anything else it can think of. It has to be collected from all of us. What if I don't pay income tax or VAT, then what? Well if you don't pay it to the government, it still gets to stay in your pocket. That is why the government needs to tax everybody. Money should stay in my pocket. The government doesn't want you to be able to spend money, but there is always money to pay for things like the national highway. If the government can't pay for the national highway, then it can't pay for anything. How do I know this? You have to be earning more than £500 a month. You then get taxed on it. Why not? I'm earning this much every month. So you get a little extra, but it means more money goes into the national highway which means we have less"

B1,"Watering the Desert  It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh Morocco. It doesn’t happen frequently and when it does the city’s water pipes can’t manage the sudden floods which turn the streets into rivers. But as many winters have remained dry in recent times when the rain does come it is welcomed by the local people. Water is the biggest thing in Marrakesh and when the people don't have any then they have to suffer. But now people no longer suffer as much and have found a way to keep the water table up, as the people now prefer to drink water from the underground springs that are now running well again.

B1,"Gareth Ellis Gareth Ellis 13 is the youngest son of Alan an engineer and Kath a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers but Gareth's dream was always to become a clown. Three years ago Alan Kath and Gareth joined the circus. 'People laugh when we tell them' says Kath. 'I think he always knew his dream would come true.' The family have owned and run the circus for the past nine years, but in 2005 Gareth took it over and has expanded it into a worldwide circus where a regular touring circus is held every year. The family, with Kath and Gareth, travel to Australia and South America. Gareth has now completed the basic classes required to become an animal handler and in September 2008 he started his official apprenticeship at the circus. This is the most important stage of his life; an apprenticeship he has worked hard for. Gareth has also achieved a master's degree in circus arts and training (MACA) from the University of Cambridge, where he learned to use computers in circus training and was awarded a Doctorate of Philosophy in circus arts and training in June 2012. Gareth was admitted to the Royal College of Circus Instructors in 2007. In October 2008, Gareth took part in his first international circus competition when he performed at the 'Circus World Championships' in Moscow and was awarded a silver medal in the 'Circus Dancing' competition. In July 2009 Gareth won a gold medal at the 'Femto-Circus' in Rotterdam in the 'Dancing' competition. Gareth has been awarded the 'Femto-Circus' title for two years running. In January 2010 Gareth was involved in an accident when he fell from a ring while performing in a training ring. He suffered a broken arm and hand and was advised to have surgery"
B1,"Little Chefs For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. They are taught how to make a special dish for a party and enjoy a pot roast on Sundays. “I’m very keen. Last year I made a lot of meat pies, which my little boys loved!” explained Margaret. This is the second year of the programme and they have already created a great number of recipes for a Christmas party. “People say my pies are as good as those that the chefs in famous restaurants make!” added Margaret. The children learn about nutrition and the importance of a balanced diet. There is always a fruit on each table to give children the right advice about what they eat. In addition they are given plenty of advice about what type of food should be cooked. “What they make for a course is based on what we need in our daily lives,” explained Margaret. Children learn to cook with care and taste and have a lot of fun. As the children get older they take on bigger and bigger roles. They prepare the courses for other children and are responsible for the kitchen as well. This year, four chefs took over the preparation of the courses and they are so popular that other children come to see them. The first course runs in early September but the final course is held in late December and the children are very excited. “I can’t wait! I can’t wait to meet the chefs!” shouted Elmer from the edge of the garden. The three youngest children joined in"
B1,"HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It consists of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. Honey is usually sold in a honeycomb-shaped vessel; these are sold from beekeepers at farmers' markets, or to beekeepers at markets. These bees may also supply honey to feed other species such as wasps or hornets. Honey is also a good food for bees, and is used as medicine. Honey contains vitamin C, flavonoids, and other substances that protect bees from parasites such as aphids and mites. Bees may build hive hives anywhere in their natural range. Honeybees can live in tropical climates, but will thrive in the colder temperatures of northern climates. Most honey produced in Australia is grown in Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales. In some areas of northern New South Wales, bees can be found. They will typically nest inside cavities, or under eaves. Honeybees also produce nectar and pollen, which are stored in their combs until needed. Honey is produced by bees that are active all year round. Some bees require more than one season to produce enough honey. Bees need just one season to produce the required amount of honey, but may need a second season to find another bee to pollinate the plants they have found. Honey has medicinal properties, and is often used for treating a variety of health issues. It also acts as a mild anthelmintic against bacteria, particularly H. influenzae, and may be useful for the treatment of diarrhea. It has a soothing effect on the stomach and may be used as a"

Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain.
No one would have expected a collection such as New Writing 3 to have so much fiction, especially from the leading names. Yet there is a wide variety of writing by both new writers and established writers. I was fascinated by the pieces on Charles Dickens and the life of Mary Wollstonecraft - it is a shame they have not all appeared in a single collection - but I would have had to pay £17.99 to get them all. There are some very good stories about the famous women of the past, some fiction, some non-fiction and some very interesting essays on the history of fiction.
The essays on fantasy and on modernism are especially interesting. There is also an interesting discussion of why there is a lot more contemporary writing than previous years. A lot of the new writing is written for adult readers and is of course suitable for them. If you love books, if you want more original writing, this is the book for you. If you enjoy fiction and are not always that keen on reading original work, this is the book for you.

'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio then to press previews all before lunch. I felt really self-conscious as I didn't look anything special or special enough. But then the boss turned up - he looked after the press and was very friendly. So that was nice. The biggest surprise was when I went to speak to Marie Claire and they told me that I would appear in their magazine that very day. It didn't seem that possible. That morning I had my hair cut and straightened by a lovely black woman. When we walked to the office I wore black tracksuit bottoms and a white shirt with a red collar. I felt like I was on a movie set. It was exciting and I felt a little bit like a celebrity. But it all came back to work and all my worries about how it was going to be for the day started to fade away. The boss was so kind as he asked me to help decorate the office. That was the day I learned about the work I was going to be doing. As I was setting up the decoration he suddenly stopped and said, ""You don't have to do that. That is something we can do ourselves"". We spent the morning doing a lot of little tasks in the office. I had no idea what was going to come up next. On my break I went to another office to talk to a manager but they were already booked. A good friend of mine - a guy named David - told me he knew a photographer and I immediately thought it was someone with a great eye for still-life photography"
B2,"Onto a winner Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse two bushy-bearded brothers in their forties are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico USA and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. The brothers have played this game all their lives, they love it. After a drink with their wives they continue the story. Dave told Norm to put down the money and Norm did so, but did not forget that he needed to put something to cover the expense. Norm put down a dollar bill that had been in his wallet since the previous night and Dave added another dollar bill to the same position. The brothers then decided that next week Dave would have to go to work without leaving the house and Norm would travel to the city with his wife. Next day both brothers went to work with the only idea in mind of how to make money on the game. At the end of the day Norm earned almost three times more than Dave, even though he had to leave the game to get to work. That evening the brothers watched on TV an interview with a famous TV presenter and decided that they would also try to play the game. The night before the game, while the brothers were at home, they had to make a will and they were shocked when Norm wanted to take only Norm's name. The next morning they both went to work. Next morning their game was in full swing. Dave, a professional banker, started on his first job out of college. He was an investment banker with five thousand dollars a year salary. Norm, on the other hand, had only one job, he had a summer job working at the local pool. Each had a different problem. Dave could not make a profit out"
B2,"Then his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships' lights shone. The moon in its first quarter hung over the hill to the west and the stars were clear and bright. Five minutes later Dr Kemp pulled down the window again and returned to his writing desk. The town seemed to be sleeping peacefully. The moonlight shone across the green lawn and the shining water of the lake shone as brightly in the night as it always did. But the sound of the ships' bell rang out loud and clear in the still night. Dr Kemp stared for a long moment and then sat back down to his writing desk and resumed his typing. The sound of the ships' bell rang again a short while later and then stopped, for it had died down to a dull, regular sound. Then the sound of the ships' bell seemed to come from outside the window as it repeated itself. Dr Kemp was frightened now and jumped from his seat. He looked around nervously. There were five sailors standing on the dock looking intently at the window. Then suddenly the sailor who had been staring at the window moved into the road opposite the shipyard and a moment later another sailor appeared. Each one of the sailors wore a sailor's hat. They were all wearing bright red, white and gold striped sashes and their hats pointed straight down. They were standing in a column of five men with arms waving straight down. They seemed to be the royal sailors and Dr Kemp wondered nervously if this was the beginning of a revolution. He hurriedly closed the window and jumped back to his desk. He could hear the ships' bell ringing again. But it sounded far away as though it were far away in another country. As he glanced towards the front of the house at the dock, Dr Kemp"

The article's first paragraph contains a general statement of the problem without much of a detailed description of the case or any information about the research results. The second paragraph describes two specific solutions proposed by researchers, one of which is actually part of the research results presented in the article. The final paragraph describes a final solution proposed by the researchers, but it does not appear that they have actually developed that solution (e.g., by providing more detailed information about what they're doing). In fact, there is still some ambiguity here: are they not already developing a solution? Why haven't they developed that solution yet?The article reports that the ""cavers"" have created some 2200 rock paintings and have placed them on rocks from the Simeoni and Chur-La Cheverny, some 2 km away from the original site, as well as in a valley near the Chur-La Cheverny itself.

The rock art is visible to the right of the arrows, at the middle of this two bar chart. As you can see, some of the rock paintings show the same figures or images again and again while others do not. For example"
B2,"We are being bombarded with advertisements all the time and a lot of them are targeted at young people. Smaller children apart from spending their own pocket money can also influence what their parents buy so many TV ads are created with kids in mind. For example adverts for drinks feature cartoon animals.

Adverts for sports cars are particularly common in the early years of adult life. Cars with fast engines have a stronger effect. Children especially like these cars. They can imagine themselves behind the wheel of the most powerful sports car, if they only had the money to buy one.

Adverts for luxury items also affect people of all ages. You can imagine a person having only ten or twelve thousand dollars, who would like to buy a watch with a big, round face. The adverts for watches often feature beautiful women, with their long hair and the ability to pick the right time. 

We must agree with a critic from the USA who points out that, the adverts with the most appeal to children, have nothing to do with their age.

How do you think an advertisement is aimed at young people? Would you be influenced by one?Adverts for toys, cars or watches are aimed at people aged 18 - 30. Young people are very often influenced by this kind of advertisement because, as children, they have less money and it is normal for them to think about the money needed. Adverts for sports cars or luxury watches tend to be aimed at adults aged 35-60. The advertisers know that a watch has to be a good investment for their long-term financial goals, and this makes their advertisement more attractive to this age group.

It is true that, children and young people have a strong influence on the decisions of adults,"
B2,"No Title Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place that often worked. This is called a move-on. One of the reasons for this was that Dublin is very small. A lot of people left town for the Gold Rush, so it became overcrowded with houses. People with money knew one person who knew one person who had left Dublin. They could find a good flat for a bargain price if they were patient. A few weeks later the family of the person left Dublin would come to collect the flat. The move-on became even easier because in those days you could just walk through the streets and see a house with a good price written in the window. If you knew the people, you could get in the car and drive to that house to offer your services. In Dublin one could find work by showing up on Monday and asking around. It’s the only way to get around, so people were always around to help you. If you know someone who can drive a car, this is a way of going around town. It was also a way for people to make new friends. Dublin had plenty of taverns where people could meet and swap stories. And those stories weren’t just about Ireland. The whole world was a potential story to tell. Everyone was welcome in the tavern. The same could be said for a nice room in a good flat. Everyone was welcome at the price of a drink. You could stay all day or go to work in the morning. If you knew the owner he or she would find an honest price for"
B2,"Interview Tips First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress our eye contact our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words. So what are you waiting for? Start the conversation in a meaningful way and it will not be a waste of time!

Ask questions to learn about the other person's life and to find out information that will help you learn more about them.
Make eye contact with the other person. Avoid looking at your phone, reading or reading glasses, or another object that you can easily lose eye contact with.

Remember that it's never too early to talk to someone. If you feel like you have a connection already then you're most likely on the right track.
It's okay to talk about yourself. Everyone has their own personal stories to tell. However, don't take up too much of the other person's time by doing this. Instead, allow them to introduce themselves and then introduce yourself as well.

If you do talk about yourself, be genuine. It's easy to over-share if you aren't sure if you are making a true connection.
You can ask follow up questions to make sure that you have not left any questions unanswered.
2. Think positive.: It's easy to get negative when you're feeling alone or down on yourself. Try to think about things that are good about yourself, even if you only do this for a few seconds. If you can stop and focus on things that are good about yourself, then your body will also associate positive thoughts with your appearance and will have an easier time adjusting to your appearance.

B2,"What had happened? Where had she gone? There was much confusion on the stage and in the audience. Raoul had cried out. Count Philippe had jumped up in his box. People looked at them and wondered if this event was connected in any way with the paragraph in the morning's paper. 
  
 'Well, it's been a rough night,' Mr. Halsey finally said to the actress. He had taken a seat in the front row. He was a short man with a sharp-pointed nose, which the actor said had been a little worse for wear since the show started and which caused him a certain amount of embarrassment. 'I got up after a bit and when I looked down from the box I found something black on the floor. It was a woman! It was a strange thing to find,' the actor added. 'I had to rush in and clean up, but after that it was just as the show was ending.' 
  
 'You did what? She was there all evening! What's her name?' asked Professor Fenton. He was Professor of English at the University of Bristol. 
  
 'Oh, I don't think I'd like to tell you,' the actor said with a smile. 'That's a secret between us. But she was there for hours -- and had an elegant costume on. She was a nice young woman, and I'm sure if you saw her she'd be quite surprised to hear that you'd noticed her. She was the best of us, you know. The best actress.'

B2,"Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. The creatures we love live in the ocean, they are a special part of our life here. They are very intelligent, we think of them as our friends. There are almost two million of them in the world, yet they still face a great deal of danger. Whales and dolphins are found in most places and they live together. There are no differences between them - for example they live in the sea, are very social, like to swim and to play with each other. They feed together, feed on the same food, they have a community spirit. Their habitat is mostly deep ocean - deep water and coral reefs. They spend a lot of time out of the water and they see an ocean that is full of life. There are many types of dolphins but many are solitary creatures - dolphins that go out of the sea a lot but spend very little time at the beach. Some of them like to hunt but not all of them live like whales. Dolphins are also prey. In their natural habitat they hunt other dolphins as well as fish, the main food sources for them. They are hunted by humans and for commercial purposes. We think they are friendly creatures and they may even teach us some things about friendship. They are intelligent, sociable, social and playful creatures that live by the sea in deep ocean. People all over the world are proud of them. We say they are part of us and are our friends. The population has increased in the last 100 years. Their population has increased enormously"

We're so busy communicating that we don't have time to think we don't have time to sit down and have a conversation. I wanted to know how much of this is a generational difference and how much is an individual thing.
In this report I have explored some of the most popular social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube and Instagram Direct, to name a few. You can read the report for yourself at https://sustainability.umich.edu/life-and-style/mobile-life/mobile-life-and-style/mobile-life-and-style-summary.pdf.
It has been a year since the election of Donald Trump and a year since the Brexit vote. It’s worth remembering both these votes were a reaction to popular, populist, nationalist politics that sought to reduce and dismantle institutions and make the population more responsible for their own lives.
The question many people might be asking is, how can we resist the urge to give these movements a foothold?
How can we resist this urge to connect ourselves to the political, social and economic life of other people, to make us feel connected to the rest of the world and to stop feeling like a minority at the edges of society?
Social media sites are increasingly important to the way we communicate, to the way we feel connected to the world and to the way we think and act.

B2,"Hamlet was angry that she should give such a dear and respectful name as father to the murderer of his true father and he replied sharply 'Mother you have much offended my father.' The queen asked him if he had forgotten who he was speaking to. 'Oh!' replied Hamlet. 'I wish I could forget. How can I help it?' 'And why should not you forget?' 'My mother told me that the murderer should be punished as she deserved for not caring enough for her child. So my father's death has troubled me.' 'That you think so strongly of your mother does not excuse her for not caring enough. Nor for giving that unfortunate man such a cruel and unjust sentence. It is not she, it is you, who has to forgive but you.' 'No, it is I who have to forgive,' replied Hamlet. 'Forgive whom?' The king said 'Forgive yourself.' 'My god, father, that is ridiculous!' But there was no help for it.' This play contains a considerable amount of swearing. It is performed with no censors in England these days, and so there are plenty of instances of swearing on stage, most of which are fairly mild. It also contains a lot of 'bad language' and 'bad words' so keep an eye on that. But, for the most part, this is a relatively innocent production. Shakespeare used this play with his sonnet form to write a couple of famous sonnets, and the play as a whole shows his mastery of the sonnet form. It is an interesting play. For example: There is no love in this world like mother's love, it is sweet and pure and it never ends. There are so many things one could say in response to this! One of my favorites is: No one's"

A. ‘My customers are friends' says CHRISTINE HOGAN who runs a computer-aided design business with a turnover of over £200000 a year and four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved out of London to the country when our children were small and I wanted work I could do at home. I wanted the privacy of countryside living, even if it meant travelling a little to get there.' B. 'It’s hard to say! We’ve been in Cornwall for six months now and we’re quite happy there. The weather is great, although I don’t like the way it gets dark so early and stays dark for so long every night. Our children have had very little exposure to modern technology and I’m very concerned about what they will be using in ten years’ time. We have no children and so we’ve had to rely on our grandchildren to do some work for us. We have a very active four year old who is very energetic. Sometimes it’s just difficult not to let him take up too much space.' C. 'I’ve always lived in town so buying a business in a rural area is very different for me. I thought we were going to be out in the countryside but the only roads around here lead into town! You can go up and down them in an hour! Even if it was half an hour I’d still prefer to be out in the countryside, although there’s not a great deal to do here apart from walk, walk and walk. It’s only when people stop walking for a minute or so that I realise we’re not really in the countryside!' D. 'I’ve had to adapt as I’ve"
B2,"Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves. In On the Origin of Species published in 1859 Darwin described the process of natural selection. The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. This means that organisms that are less fit may be driven out of existence. This is also known as natural selection. It was clear from Darwin's writing that he knew about natural selection, but he used this to demonstrate his theory that natural selection was happening. There is even evidence that he had seen it himself as he was reading a book on natural selection by an American botanist. What was new was Darwin's ability to use the scientific method to demonstrate that this natural selection was causing changes in organisms and species. It was this development of a scientific theory of natural selection that led to his work on evolution. As a biologist, he was able to show that the characteristics of organisms and the environments that they lived in played a role in the process of natural selection and that this could create differences in the reproductive success of organisms. This was a huge step forward because it meant that organisms could be shown to reproduce differently according to their environment. It meant that there was also a scientific explanation for the process of reproduction that was not explained by the reproductive biology of other animals such as birds or frogs. But the most important result for Charles Darwin and evolution was that natural selection was able to explain the mechanism and the origins of diversity. It also led to the concept that organisms had a purpose in the environment they lived in. Although the process of natural selection can be seen in other organisms, Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection has since changed considerably. Because Darwin used the scientific method to demonstrate the effects of natural selection"
B2,No Title We always went to Ireland in June. Ever since the four of us began to go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea not far from the village of Ardbeag. There are a few hundred yards of pebbled walk around the house and around the bay. Then there is a long gravel drive up to the house from the sand beach. I was nine or ten at the time and my brother and sister were nine and twelve. We always drove up together and would play golf on the beach. It was a very relaxing trip and we played golf in the Irish weather on the sand and then spent the night there. We always enjoyed the trip and I have always been a huge fan of Glencorn Lodge. It had a great atmosphere and served great tea. This time round my mother went along with us. My mother was on a business trip and she didn't want to do anything too strenuous. It was a beautiful trip and we stayed over night at the lodge. We always played golf there in the afternoon. We always played in the Irish sunshine which was very different to England. My mother had a great time and we all had our annual holiday. It was always fun. I'd always wanted to go to Ireland but never got the chance to as my brother had to go before me. Now it was my turn. It was always a big deal to see Ireland and all the people we'd meet and we'd always go there to celebrate my sister's birthday in the summer. The day arrived when we'd all get into a car and drive to County Mayo in northern Ireland to celebrate. I'd always wanted to go to Mayo in Ireland since I was
B2,"Going up the wall  Once climbers went to the mountains. Now a challenging climb can be had anywhere indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. He is in with a chance to win a bronze medal for France. The competition is tough. Competitors from as far afield as India are here. It's like a World Cup of climbing. The audience goes wild when Lombard reaches the top of the wall. He hangs there for a minute or two, the crowd watching in rapturous silence. It is difficult climbing, but the crowd and Lombard believe he can keep on climbing until he reaches the top. Lombard is the most famous climber in the world. His achievements have been hailed by the press and the public. But, like most athletes, Lombard has his demons. Sometimes he has a breakdown in his hotel. He needs time to recover, and it seems that his ability for hard work and determination is greater than his ability to cope with stress. For this story, I have travelled to England. I have been in Birmingham, where Lombard is training with a small group of eight other climbers. We meet at an outside café for breakfast. At 9.30am the group has just finished their workout and are now eating and drinking. Lombard sits on a stool at the table, his back to the wall, eating a banana and chatting to the others. His long grey hair and beard are tousled with the wind blowing around him. His face is composed, but it is clear that he is not enjoying the early hours of the day. It is 9.45am and the crowd in Birmingham are still"
B2,"However most of the problems were small and most of the guests at the conference were amazed by the network. After this the ARPAnet began to grow even more rapidly. But now it was not the world's only network of computers. After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful other networks began to appear. The most important of them all, called the Internet, was created by Bruce Sterling and Tim Berners-Lee, whose research was published in their dissertation ""The World Wide Web: A Research Manifesto"". The most amazing part of the Internet was, although it was created by humans, it had already proven to be much more efficient than the ARPAnet. It allowed computers to communicate with computers and to communicate with any computer, whether it was located in Italy or the USA or Japan, all through the Internet. It was now much faster, more affordable and free, all thanks to the Internet and the ARPAnet.

All that was left for the Internet to show is its worth, and that it would help people and solve problems worldwide. Although this had not happened as fast as people had expected, the Internet had grown and improved all the time. This had proven how useful it could be, even more so than the ARPAnet, but it had taken almost 30 years, compared to just 4 years for the Internet.

So, after more than 30 years, the ARPAnet was abandoned, but the Internet was born and it would prove that the human imagination could become much more effective than what it had shown on paper.The ARPAnet was created by scientists who were trying to prove that computers could communicate. They did this by simulating the World Wide Web. They also invented the Internet to allow them to do it. The Internet"
B2,"It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. Then one day after school Chris noticed a large, metal pole protruding from the hedge and decided to have a look at it. Chris and his friends decided that it would be an interesting idea to stand on the pole when they were old enough. Chris tried it once in his parents back garden, but unfortunately when he started he fell off the pole and broke several bones in both his arms. It was a lot of fun though, and Chris thought that it might be nice to do it again some day. A year or so later Chris and his friends were talking about what they would do when they got big enough to stand on a metal pole, and they decided to try it out at the end of the summer. They set up a wooden pole on the other side of their front garden and tried putting their feet on it. They thought that it would be fun and they would be able to practise their climbing skills and work on their endurance - perfect preparation for a pole climbing contest! Chris and his friends thought that they would try to stand on the pole by themselves after getting big enough, but a few days before the event, on a hot and sunny day, all the friends got stuck in the hedge on the other side of the garden and there was no way of getting out. Chris and his friends just sat and waited a few hours until the sun had gone down, and then they got to work on their technique. After a good bit of practice it looked like Chris and his friends could do it"

My son Gary was given his chance with cooking and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity I rushed over to look at the place. Once there I saw my son Gary cooking in a small restaurant. It was so small, but I thought it would turn into a big business one day. That turned out to be the last time I saw him. The restaurant closed before it got bigger. This is my story.
It was a typical Friday evening in May 1960. I was 12 and had taken my parents for a dinner at a nice restaurant. That was the last time I saw my father. I have no regrets about that. He was a good father, but it didn’t turn out the way he wanted.
I was 12 years old and my parents had taken me to dinner at a restaurant. That was the last time I saw my father. It was a horrible experience. I was looking forward to that evening for a long time because it was our family's anniversary. My parents had taken me to a restaurant that I would remember. I had met him twice before: once when I took part in a competition and then later when I went to work in his restaurant. The restaurant was called The Duke of Wellington's and it was owned by my friend and the great, chef, John Moore. He worked for many years at the restaurant.

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Last year her bosses, a couple who had run a chalet for the previous 20 years, told her they didn't want to renew her contract. She had taken the job without a full-time job, but her grandparents offered to pay for her flight to the Alps. ""I wanted to show I could do something different, do my bit for the economy and I had a summer of adventure,"" she says. ""And the job paid for a part of my holidays. So I did it."" Her grandparents were disappointed when she started work last year, so when this year they saw a new post advertised, they thought Sarah would love it. What she loved most, she says, was the opportunity to meet other chalet girls from all over the world, and, after a difficult start to life, find some peace and quiet in the idyllic French chalet in the Alps. ""The chalet can be a little daunting at first,"" she says. ""But most chalet girls are very friendly. One of my friends, who I have worked with for three years, is English. She's living in the UK now and we met up for tea one weekend. I'm looking forward to continuing that friendship now we are all chalet girls."" It's a busy time of year for her.

B2,"An eye for detail Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. Others are carefully arranged. The whole garden is a study in colour and contrast. The house itself was designed to blend into the background and is as beautiful in the garden as outside. I love seeing it filled with flowers.
These photos were taken last year when the roses in the garden were in full flower. The house and garden were closed at the time.
This is a very popular place, the only thing missing is a horse to run on the lawn!

But then came a strange sound, as if Buck were speaking directly to them, and as if Buck was calling their name, then there was a strange light which began to shine in the room. The Hailey trial started again that same night. Jake listened intently to the trial as the new picture showed the young man who was about to take his own life and then the news that the judge had acquitted the young man of murder. The whole courtroom jumped up and people began to applaud the young man as he went free. Jake and Carla stared at the television in shock. The whole of Memphis stared in the same direction. But there was one person who was not happy that the Hailey trial was finally over. He thought it the worst crime of our time and so, when the TV went off, he shouted, ""You killed the judge!"" To his surprise the man was the only one who smiled and said, ""Judge Gant has acquitted a young man who had committed a horrendous crime."" The old man, who could only have been in his sixties or seventies, had to accept the man's explanation."
B2,"Week after week British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people’s privacy and break the newspaper editors’ code of practice. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion this is not typical. More usually great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page. It is in the public interest to promote the freedom of expression but when this freedom leads to distress or ill-feeling the press has a duty to balance [line 7: beginning] these competing interests and hold public figures to a higher standard.

A good line, I think, even though it might be somewhat misleading. The way it's used here is as a way of stating that the article's title is inaccurate and its content (the content that's in the paragraph, not the title) is the news, when the article's title is inaccurate and the content is the news.
The fact that the title does not use 'public interest' and has instead used the adjective 'freedom' makes it the wrong word choice. As is, it's the wrong sentence.
If a sentence starts with 'Freedom of expression' I am almost always less interested in reading the rest of the text. I find that the phrase sounds a bit like something that is said on the radio, or on the news, that is usually about a celebrity or something else with a story that is somewhat disconnected from the story in the paragraph.

Line break is too thick.
The text is too long.
The text does not fit on the page.

You would remove all of the above in the following words:

Freedom of expression in the public interest

The next sentence would read:

A good line is one which promotes the freedom of expression but which also holds"

The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them. There was new furniture and Paul had a teacher. He was really going to Eton his father's school in the following autumn.

But then he found out something really weird. There were two voices from the house with him. One was talking in a voice which sounded like his father speaking and the other was a girl. It was a girl with her mouth always open. It was very scary!

In the following morning Paul looked in his father's room and saw the teacher's desk, the furniture and his father's old books which he was going to burn. Then he came to his house and found it empty. The next morning Paul ran to the school but the teacher was not there. Paul was really scared so he decided to stay there all day. He came back home after dark and went to his room. After a while he suddenly heard another voice saying something to his mother saying he could buy a gun for five pounds. She smiled and said it would be funny. Then a girl with an awful voice appeared in his bedroom, grabbed Paul by the shoulders and started to yell. Then a third voice was there and shouted at his mother. Then suddenly there were thousands of voices, and Paul was scared because it was so loud. They yelled something horrible and Paul heard his mother screaming. Then suddenly there was no noise except for a strange noise and then Paul found he was in his bedroom, alone, wearing only a white t-shirt. He saw his mother lying on the floor next to his father and his grandmother on the other side of the room. The walls were covered with his grandfather's old furniture"

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch a 24-year-old from West Sussex. She has been working with the chalet owners, in their kitchen, for three months. Now, as her holiday is coming to an end she reflects on how achingly simple a chalet life can be. “It can be a lot of work, but there’s a lot of time to do things you want to do,” she says. “There are a lot of lovely things to do, like going out to the forest, hiking or bird-watching. “The kitchen is a lot of work, I love cooking but sometimes it can be really exhausting! It’s not too boring. There’s a lot of good things I’ve learned, like how to cook good French food. We have great French cooks over here. It’s great to use them to cook with,” says Sarah. She was brought up in a chalet with her family, which she shared with seven of her 17 siblings, in New Cross, Hertfordshire. After leaving school, Sarah worked as a care assistant in London, then moved to France, where she worked in restaurants and was trained as a chef. Last year she was working in a chalet in the chalet at the centre of all the fuss: Chamonix. “We had great time,” she says. And she is just as excited about this year’s holiday as last year.

When I met her she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. 'I'm on a roll this year,' she said, beaming. 'I've been training hard, I'm in excellent condition. Every day I want to show I'm good enough.' Ellis was a typical netball player, in everything but the uniform. She was born in Scotland but moved to Britain as a child with her Scottish father. As soon as she can walk she wants to play netball and is determined to find a team that will give her an opportunity to do so. 'I've been playing on and off since I was seven,' she says. 'My mum made sure my sister and I were given a chance to play and to do well. It's in our blood, it's in our family. We've got that inner drive to keep doing it. It is our passion, it's how we've been brought up.' She's never been in any other sport, apart from netball, 'and I hate running, so I'm always going to play this.' Despite being captain of her country, the 31-year-old doesn't get a lot of money. 'I make the decision about my salary and when I go on the international tours and when I'm part of a team and I'm on a salary I make the decision,' she says. 'But it's not easy. I've got my little two children, a mortgage to pay, my mortgage to pay, rent to pay, car insurance... It's not easy.' On this day"

It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill. Ice hockey was also played but it was mainly men's sport. Ice skating and hockey evolved together. In the early 20th century skating was brought out of the shadow of hockey.

But the next day she'd be leaving all of this behind. ""We haven't really thought about it,"" she said. ""I mean I've got a job so I'm not missing a lot of training."" The 31-year-old slawinski, known as 'the skipper', is one of a number of England's players who are playing in the World Cup, which begins in two weeks' time. ""I've got three kids at school so I'm home before it opens,"" she said. ""I actually think it's a really good thing to do, I'd rather be training and playing my best than not even be a part of the team."" The competition has taken on a life of its own since England won gold in New Zealand in 2013, with the team captained by Slawinski and the media often speculating about whether she has the support of her team-mates. Despite an inconsistent performance in previous tournaments, they won the last two Women's World Cups, but they haven't finished a tournament since winning in 2015. And it's a huge task facing England: the only countries yet to lose a single match are Papua New Guinea, who they lost to in London, and the USA, who they beat in Vancouver.

Teenager with a taste for endurance WANTED: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete preferably female. Chance to work with potential Olympic champion. Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions) distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage).

1 mile race - 
I have no experience of this. I just had a long run yesterday (11 miles total), including a 5 mile run this morning. 
What I can recommend to you is getting used to running that long distance. My first long run was a race last May. It was about 5 miles and I was feeling pretty sore the next day. I also had to walk a mile on the day. My second long run was a long one and I could feel the pain of the long run but I also felt like it was way easier than my first one. 
My general advice is get used to running that long distance. 
It took me about 4 weeks to get used to it.You already mentioned a Triathlete. There are a few ways to go with training.  

Run for an hour (5km) three times a week  This is good for your lungs and will build endurance and core strength.

B2,"We are literally drowning in news. Have you ever tried reading the whole newspaper including the financial and sports pages? Or have you followed every piece of news on the front page of a news website? It's practically impossible. Reuters alone puts out 3.5 million news stories a year. And that's just one source. What about national and local papers? Do you even have a newspaper in your city? If not, you are in the minority. Newspapers are going extinct. Every day, hundreds if not thousands of newspapers are closing. They are being replaced by digital only businesses. And that's the reason why all the newspapers in the world are not reporting on the latest technological advances. If you are not informed, you cannot make educated decisions on the future.
Even when they are not reporting news on technology, newspapers still provide us with some general news every day. For example, when you walk down the street, what do you see more frequently? A billboard for a specific brand or your neighbor's cat? 

Well, you need to know which is more important, a picture or a story. And when it comes to technological advancements, it's hard to beat a good story. Take the news stories about the development of the first driverless cars. Is it any surprise they are being covered by all the newspapers? That's a real story that could affect every single person living in the future. 
The same goes for the Internet. If you do not keep yourself informed with new technologies, you cannot make good decisions on the Internet or in the future. If you only follow the tech news on your favorite website, you will miss out on many developments that could have a great impact in our daily lives.

Of course, we are very pleased to provide such a comprehensive answer. If you want to be published we suggest you look to the following places. We don't think this is too much to ask.

You can publish a collection of your short fiction at your own website: www.writing.net. This is a simple process of uploading a few files and having them reviewed by one of the editors. We think this is a very good place to get your work published.
You can put in a nomination for a regional or national anthology. For the former you might get a small fee for your work, for the latter, a modest one. You need to be careful about putting in too many submissions and failing to get noticed. If you do, you could still find yourself without work.
You could go for a national competition: an essay competition or poetry contest. Not for money though, so there will be a small fee for judging. Again you need to be careful and not too many people submit, so that you won't have a hard time getting noticed. This is a great way to get noticed and publish your work though.
You can enter the poetry contest for the annual ""The New Yorker Magazine"" competition. Just email them a poem, it can be in any style, and it will be on the website. Don't put in too many poems or you won't be noticed. Don"

One night at three in the morning he unlocked Avery's office on the fourth floor with one of the keys Abby had given him. Mitch went through the door and sat down. He was tired. As always Abby was not home. Mitch checked the time on the clock. It was one in the morning. A look around him showed that it was almost nine. It was the fourth floor, but it took all night to get to the fourth floor after a long day at work. Mitch decided to wait for Abby until morning. He was still curious about the room number. At ten in the morning he started knocking on the door. When no one answered he called. Finally someone answered. ""Abby, it's Mitch."" ""What're you doing here?"" The voice was quiet and strong. ""I know where the room number is,"" said the voice, ""if you've been reading my journals you know I've been having some problems with money."" ""Read my journals? Do you have a pen and paper, because I'm really tired, ""said the girl. She came out of the bathroom. ""Mitch, come in. I'll make you a sandwich."" ""No thanks,"" said Mitch.

B2,"Film Critic Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing - novels for other newspapers films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. But working for The Front Page was my chance to work on a full-time basis. Here we look back at ten years of writing on films and the ten most important films of this period.
As is generally the case for film reviews, there are different 'vintage' periods - a time for particular films and a time for a film critic. I am a bit of a retrofilm critic, reviewing classic films from a time I was a kid and an adult. Now I am looking back on the ten most influential films of the last ten years, which, if I may be so bold, I feel is a vintage year for film criticism.
The last ten years have been extraordinary, not only for the films themselves, but for the films themselves, the industry and the cinema itself. There have been a number of breakthrough films. The film where it all seemed to change in a few minutes, was the remake of The Shining. A film about two adults going on holiday, Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, and everything going right for them, and something went horribly wrong. It turned out not to be a cheap copy, but a hugely successful follow-up to the very success of Stephen King's novel, and a great example of the power of marketing, a clever marketing campaign and a good script.
As for comedies, there has been an explosion of them. The last decade has seen the release of a record number of films, almost every week. There have been"
B2,"Favourite places Bruce I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me not empty deserts. When I was eight I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. I like places with a quiet atmosphere. And I always take my camera, that's why. My favourite place was near Lastingham where I used to take photos of the trees, the beautiful rivers and the mountain tops. Also I remember a lot my swimming in the pools of the lakes, the hot springs and the walk along the woods. Also, when I look back, I think I was very lucky that summer in Lastingham made me fall in love with the countryside. I think the countryside in England is even more beautiful than the countryside in Scandinavia, because there you have the beautiful countryside in a beautiful nature. That's why I think the countryside of England must be my favourite place. Favourite music You know me well, now you must know my favourite band: the Smokers. I have a collection of all their albums. It's a bit complicated because I've tried to choose the best one, but they're all equally great. I really love the songs about your homeland, about your countryside, about the countryside of Scandinavia. I love the song ""The King"" and the song ""Travelling Home."" I love all the songs about England. I prefer ""Travelling Home"" because it's more optimistic. That's the reason I like it more. Favourite book Of course, the book I'd like to have would be ""The Hobbit"", but I'll never get it. You know how much I like Tolkien and how much I want him to"

A murder is announced and will take place on Friday October 29th at Little Paddocks at 6.30 p.m. The local people are so excited that they are preparing a party to celebrate. It is to last all night and into the early hours.' 'Archie, who will attend the party?' asked the Colonel. 'Well there will be about eight of us. First we'll leave for the house and, as I promised my husband that I would not leave the village until the next day I will stay there until Saturday. Then, I am going to arrange a party for the people and I will send for you tomorrow at half twelve to attend it. That's all.' 'Archie, do you really mean it this time?' 'Yes.' 'Well then, you will telephone me at eleven o'clock tomorrow evening to say you are in, and I'll see you at half twelve. The party is to be held at the Paddocks inn. You will write to me about it. I shall meet you there.' 'Goodbye, Mrs Easterbrook. Take care of yourself. I'll be in touch.' He hung up the telephone and said to his wife 'I've got my coat. I'll be back at half twelve.

B2,"Careers Advice You're not happy in your job at the moment but you don't know how to change? Kitty Doherty gives some good advice. The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser. You will be asked to write a brief history of yourself and then sit through a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. You will then complete some written applications to a number of agencies. This will usually involve a few interviews in a small office environment with an employee of the agency who will try to sell you on the agency's offerings and tell you about how other people have done this. The most effective people who make a good career change are the people who apply themselves to the whole process. If you really want to change your job then take the time to apply yourself to it and do the extra work required to get it done. This may cost you a little bit of money but it could save you a lot of pain later on. So if you are really unhappy in your job at the moment but you don't know how to change then you should take some time to find the information needed to get the job you want. The advice Kitty Doherty gives to change jobs is sensible and will give you the answers you need to find the job you want. However, there is a risk that if you change your job too soon you may end up losing your salary. It will always be better to wait until you are sure you want to change jobs and then to have a look to see what is on offer. You could find the job by chance but it is far more likely that you will find it by applying for jobs.Careers advice, whether you are working or not, can be very confusing and frustrating for many people.

Tim is trying to persuade Rachel to undergo an operation, but Rachel refuses. Eventually, Rachel becomes pregnant again, and learns that she is carrying twins. But because of her condition, she must continue to undergo testing. Her tests reveal that her twins' hormone levels are normal, but she still has to have an operation.

Legally it belonged to the People's Republic of China a part of the colony that was never British. In fact neither Chinese nor British law had effect there. If they wanted to sell it they could, but they didn't - there just wasn't much demand. It still looked much the same as when it was discovered.

The Kowloon Walled City of China is named after its surroundings. The area had been under siege by the Chinese for years, and although they still owned the land they would not allow people to live there. The city walls surrounded the settlement and kept the inhabitants within it. The outer wall went for nearly six miles around the settlement and was topped by the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City was built on the outside of the walls, and looked down at them.
  
 The Kowloon Walled City was the largest settlement ever, and the richest. The buildings here were taller and more expensive than anything in the rest of the world. They were like a pyramid rising to the sky. There were stores and residences on all four sides, and no houses had windows. They only had walls, like the Forbidden City. The streets were covered with the finest stone ever created, and were never paved. They were clean and orderly though, as they followed the same plan for every block. On one side of the walls were the Forbidden City and the government buildings, and on the other the wealthiest and most beautiful homes.
  
 The Kowloon Walled City was a city unlike any other. As much as it was built for the sake of prosperity, the city continued to be inhabited by a small"
B2,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE When you first enter the Model Village it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground flat and completely overgrown with brambles. For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land. But now it has become a wonderful place. It is situated in an urban setting with ample parking. It is designed to be a miniature village. The houses are built in the model village style, which makes them an interesting attraction. There are gardens, trees, old buildings, ponds, a lake for swimming and various other things for entertainment. For more details about this place read the story below: "" The Model Village. "" It has been a great joy and an educational experience for me to work in the model village of Breslau. From a very early age I always looked forward to Christmas holidays and the Model Village. Every year I had a special wish, a wish which turned into a reality. It was in 1946 when I first saw this model village. I can remember exactly which day it was because it seemed to last forever. It was during the winter holidays, and the day when the weather had been very harsh. In that season we all spent a lot of time looking over the model village and, I recall now, it was full of excitement and anticipation. I can still remember that Christmas morning when I found the toy village in front of the house. The village was all sparkling and bright. It was full of lights and decorations, and I could hardly contain my excitement. Then Santa Claus came to visit the village, and it was an event that will be remembered by me till now.

B2,"Variations on a Theme If you're thinking of taking children to a theme park there are dozens to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to test the best. Fun Island - The Burns family Last year we went to a huge theme park in the US and we thought that Fun Island might seem dull by comparison. In fact, it's an amazing place - you could spend an entire holiday in the amusement parks, and we only lasted a few hours. It took about three weeks from when we saw it advertised to the time we got there, but that included flying over America. If you're planning a large family holiday and don't mind the long wait then you should definitely consider it. 
  
 The ride is very loud, and I always felt very sick in the middle of it as my son was crying his eyes out. I'm sure it's fine when a child is quiet though. 
  
 However, there is no food and drink on the ride, so if you're getting hungry it may be a waste of money. Plus there are no toilets, so don't go to the toilet while waiting on the ride! 
  
 The park is divided into two parts. One part is full of little rides that are not really suitable for a child, and the other part is full of more advanced rides that your children will probably enjoy. There are lots of other family attractions at Fun Island, such as a big water park, a bowling alley, a water slide, and the biggest theme park in Europe with the tallest roller coaster. It costs around £10 to enter, and you can choose to ride whichever rides you want, but the main attraction is going on the ride.

I've got to be doing something that's a challenge. If I'm absorbing something new and learning I get tremendous energy. It's important to me. If I get bored I get depressed. If I'm doing a challenge I'm excited to learn something new. That's what keeps me going.' A. Jeanette Kupfermann is a journalist, author, and cofounder of the lifestyle website The Simple Life. Her first book, Why I Love My Life, was published in 2003 and is a New York Times best seller. 
  
 I think there are only four things in life that really matter. You know, when I was 18 I didn't have a life plan because I had never seen one or heard about one. I guess I learned that you have to plan for the future when you're a little kid and you learn it in school, and it's life-long. I think when you get to 50 you want to make sure you've done your best for this lifetime and have a plan so that you've fulfilled that. 
  
 That doesn't mean you have to do a whole lot of planning. That's not what planning is for. You can do a whole lot of stuff without a plan. It's about finding time and finding purpose and having fun.

What he said to me at the time was, ""I don't care if you are a model, just get that look right today."" That's what set me on the road to confidence. I have since been on the rise. Paul Hathway, 32, finance graduate I had the attitude that life was going to throw me anything at all. And you have to be ready for it, because life will give you everything you want! So I knew I had to be confident. And when you take responsibility for your"

Julia Gregson asked three young stars and their mothers to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. A. Annika Reeder 15 won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She loves gymnastics. She's just as much a girl as every other girl at the age group. It's not just about winning medals, it's also about showing your mum how you can perform well during a competition. You know you can do it, so why do it? Why should you? So she's proud of you. That she can do that for me. At least it's my mum who will be proud of me, because she knows I can do it. I want my mum to be proud of me when I'm grown up and can do things like that. She's not been as pleased with the past few years, when I've wanted to start a new job and get away from home, to start being independent, and be in my own house and have my own life. It wasn't that she didn't want me to go out and have fun and do things - it's that I didn't want to go out and do them. So that was really hard on her. Every day it gets a bit easier for me, as I do more and more and more sports and sports training at school. For example I was on a sports team at school and we had sports day when we were 14 to 15 years old, and there were other sports activities for people who weren't on sports teams. I was on a sports team and there were other sports activities like swimming and badminton and basketball, so that was more interesting for me, and I used to"
B2,"My line of work Four people talk about their jobs. Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser Science Museum I'm responsible for putting temporary exhibitions together. This includes planning and designing the exhibition and promoting it. I also check that the exhibition is displayed in the right way, and the visitor guides are ready with information about the various objects on display. My job at the museum involves managing volunteers and staff, supervising the opening and closing of the museum on a daily basis. I also have to report any problems with the museum to management. I think the best way to describe my job is that I'm responsible for all the behind-the-scenes things, including: organising our annual visitors' meeting; developing and implementing the visitor program; liaising with our sponsors; running our annual awards ceremony. This is a great way to start my career and I really enjoy being able to make a difference and help others. Sarah - Bookshop Staff At the moment, my work is mainly spent in the bookshop. I make sure our stock is kept up to date, we have the right price for what we have, keep an eye on the competition, make sure there are lots of books and magazines for customers to choose from, make sure the shop is tidy and that it looks good. Our new section - The Rare Book Room - has just been opened. It's a fantastic space and I look forward to working with other staff to make sure it's perfect for our customers. We have a fantastic selection of books and magazines. If you ever need to browse and take a look, just pop in any time you are in the shop.

B2,"The kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and riversfeeding on fish. Old trees overhang the stream half shading shallow water. Soft greens mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze.
The kingfisher is a swift but graceful bird with a long neck, wide wing and slender tail. The birds are graceful and beautiful even when they are in flight but the male bird is very vocal, his song is one of the most beautiful of any bird. They have a white face, red cheeks and a bright yellow bill. These birds are the most common of the lot and there are many different colours and patterns that they can be found. The different colour patterns can give different colours to the kingfisher but in general they are either a vibrant yellow like the ones above or deep green.
I love birds and I think that the kingfisher is my favourite. The bird is very smart and loves to be near water. His eyes are on the side of his head and he is very observant. I think this bird has the greatest story of any bird as he is very curious and curious what people will think. I guess I like birds as much as my kingfisher.
The bird is not shy as it flies and eats fish when they are on the surface of the water. They like to dive down to feed on fish and feed but they are not afraid of the water as their bill is large enough to get into the water and get food. If the water is shallow or they are close to an open river or stream they will stay in the stream or river.
The birds seem to be very inquisitive, they fly about looking at everything and seem"
B2,"Studio Audiences What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical difficultiesstudio audiences are just another common feature of television lifeand yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows for example we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? Why are they so interested? 
  
 But who are you? Who are the audience? What are they feeling? What is it like for them to be in a television studio during the making of a piece of television? Who are they in the room when they see the production, and how do they know what's going on? I don't know if I could go through those hours or days again for the sake of a programme, but I certainly would try to attend a few sessions of a course like ""Studio Audiences"" that I just found out about. The course runs from Monday to Friday for four weeks, and is sponsored by the radio station Radio 4. It is open to any ""studio audience"" - for example, anyone who works in television production.
  
 I think I would be interested in the process, not only the programmes themselves. I could imagine some of the logistical problems involved in a live audience. Imagine you've got a number of people in a room, and no screens. You have to wait for each person to turn up or ring in, so you don't know if the person is there, and you might have a couple of other people waiting to know if a certain person is there. You're also dealing with microphones that pick up what's said, and you're listening to it on the radio and the programme has been edited together. When a programme comes on, there is a lot of work to do to rearrange people"
B2,"It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris though still only fourteen was already almost two metres tall. By the time he was sixteen, he was six foot four in height and had a muscular body covered in tattoos. He had a reputation for fighting, and the local newspaper had even carried an editorial - 'Chris should be kicked out of school' - for his violent attitude. He'd also been caught taking a swing at a local football team. They let him off with a warning - though they did make him start boxing training. It was a little thing, really. Then he was caught on a second swing at the same team. This time he was sent packing, his boxing licence suspended. He still thought the paper had it wrong - it wasn't a very smart kid, after all. And he still thought about joining the navy. And then one day, he made a mistake. He saw a newspaper article on the wall about an air cadet competition. He entered, to the surprise of all - including himself - who'd already taken the decision to send him packing. He started as a scout, then a navigator, then a radar operator and eventually an aeroplane captain. He'd never had a passenger, but he did have an ace pilot with him almost every time he flew, a man who could take over the aeroplane just by opening the cockpit door. That ace pilot was his son. He'd gone on to be an air force pilot too, flying around the world and earning a reputation for skill. Chris had remained the same size. He was still a hero"
B2,"In April 1919 the British rulers in India decided to put down protests in the city of Amritsar. As people gathered in the public garden during the festival of Vaisakhi a British general ordered his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd. As well as thousands of injuries there were hundreds of deaths. Some historians point out that the massacre was not deliberate but rather a failure of the British administrators.

The massacre took place as Amritsar was preparing for the Sikh genocide, the first major one since the British arrived. The British were already alarmed that the Sikh population was growing at a rapid rate. To prevent riots, the authorities banned the sale and consumption of beef. The police, on being warned that the police had been trained by the British for many years and were very effective at quelling unrest, failed to prevent the slaughter of thousands of Sikhs in Amritsar. The situation was compounded by the fact that the Indian government, under the leadership of the Indian National Congress, was not taking any measures to control the new religious extremists.

The Amritsar massacre is often cited as an example of how the British government failed to stop the ethnic cleansing of Sikhs in British India.
The British officials claimed that if more troops had arrived in Amritsar the situation could have been prevented. The British military historians were shocked when they found that more troops were not sent. In the words of Major-General Sir Edward Lister, the general who commanded the 1st Battalion the West Midland Regiment: “We had the men to do it, and there were others we could have sent, but it was left to the discretion of the commander-in-chief”.
In his book The British in India, the British general Sir John Bar"
B2,"GM's clever EN-V concept is a two-wheeled two-seater solution to urban transport. Telegraph Motoring's Mike Rutherford has a preview and takes it for a spin. That's because of the nature of the EN-V. Last week I drove one of these though it was more like flying a small plane than driving.
First impressions of the concept are positive. The way the wheels swing down the side of the chassis, rather than bouncing around as with a car, is fantastic.
At that length there's not much space for luggage and I'd be wary about using the bike rack for anything heavier than a bike bag. But I can imagine you'd get into a car with a smaller load, then a larger load then a smaller load. I also think there could be an argument for a larger load in a compact, two-seater.
The two-seat cabin is quite nice. There are some cleverly designed elements to make it useful. There's an open door in the middle that swings down to let you in and out of the ride, which is handy when carrying more luggage than a bike rack. This is one of those concepts that is hard to make an easy transition to, but once I'd got used to it I really enjoyed it. The two seats fold away in the middle which is an ideal way to store bikes in a flat garage.
I think there's something attractive about the concept of two seats in a car with a small child in the back, because you're in a more relaxed, social setting. A bike isn't exactly a party accessory and it isn't very portable. I think two-seater cars are a great way to take children to nursery or other kid-friendly activities. If you've got a big family and a lot of bikes you can take"

A Andrea Thompson - Newsreader I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to get back there as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. In winter, when the wind blows all the way across the Mediterranean Sea, it is a real thrill. I have also visited Venice, the canals in Venice are fabulous, but if you live here you know that canals are meant for boats, not pedestrians. When I travel to Venice I always use the public transport so that I can save the environment but at the same time I enjoy the countryside at a different pace. There's a great train station in the centre of Venice, Piazza San Marco, that you can take a train from and I also love the railway station in Turin. When you get off you can see all the beautiful architecture of the city. It's a really atmospheric place and always a big surprise in the morning when you get off and don't know what's going to happen. Then you can go shopping and look at a real masterpiece of architecture. I do that every year with my husband, we are looking for the right place for the wedding and then we look for the right hotel. But, we always find the best in the end. I also love trains, I love the idea of a train that is going on a trip and not just stopping on its way to the destination. For me, it would have to be a train in a foreign country. I love visiting new places and I have also travelled a lot in different countries and met really nice people, but I still dream about travelling in Africa. I'm going to the UK this summer,"
B2,"What would happen to our planet if humans were to suddenly disappear? This is the basic hypothesis behind Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us. Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear. In one chapter there is an analysis of how New York would survive if there were no humans to take care of it. The chapter also includes a study on what would happen to the planet's ozone layer if humans were to disappear overnight. There is also a section on what might happen if an alien race came to Earth, and took to their stars, and what would happen if a human came to Earth from another universe. The World Without Us contains the latest news on current climate change, with references to the latest United Nations reports. The book does not shy away from the possibility of global warming destroying humanity's ability to survive on Earth. After all, the book's title is based on the idea that the Earth will become uninhabitable for humans if we keep using fossil fuels. As the Earth's temperature continues to rise, and the ozone layer becomes irreparable, Weisman's assessment of how our existence might end is bleak. One of the main problems with the book is that its entire premise relies on the idea that humans are the only species that ever lived. If aliens visit Earth and find nothing but wildlife and natural resources, they might conclude that humanity is not only extinct, but that there is nothing to preserve their existence on their planet. Even if the aliens could somehow survive on Earth, they might find that living here was not worth it. In this chapter, the author analyzes how the Earth would evolve if humans vanished. The Earth's climate would become cooler, with fewer trees. The land would become ice free, and eventually the sun would burn out. In addition to the climate, there are many other"
B2,"Living in the valley We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival. It was the year when the storms came early before the calendar even hinted at winter even before November was out. The valley was hit with a series of heavy rumbles in the mountains, the kind of rumbles which left people in the valley bed ridden with the aches and pains of broken bones and broken arms, legs, hands and feet. It was like some one had thrown rocks into their chest. It woke us up in the night and put the fear in us for weeks on end, but still we stayed on to live in our valley and keep on farming our lands. We couldn't just abandon our farm and leave the valley, no matter how much the land was destroyed, our people wouldn't do such a thing. We were so afraid of what was around our village that we would stand guard by our farms and homes for hours before even getting out of bed the next day. We always slept with our weapons with us even if we didn't have to. We were always afraid and we knew it. And so we would sleep with the dogs in the houses and fields. The dogs would be with us even if we didn't have to. As the seasons changed and new ones came, we still had to be prepared for the worst, just like we had been doing for all the years. And so we did. And so we stayed strong in our valley and lived through the bad years, knowing that the bad times would pass and we would overcome them. We had to. The bad times would become good times again, so we had to endure these times like the people that we are. But"

""Three million dollars"", she answered. ""We'll take care of him"", he said. ""And I'll be on guard for you"", Rita whispered back. ""It's your duty"". ""Yes, but it's too late now"" said Seymour. ""No problem! I'll give you the money and you'll kill the old man!"". Rita Cohen stared at the old man suspiciously. ""Are you insane?"" he asked. ""Yes"", said Rita Cohen, ""I'll go to his house to collect the money, you'll get the old man back, it's perfect!"" ""And you'll kill me!"" he said. ""That's okay. I'll keep myself alive until you get to him"". They waited there for hours. Rita Cohen went back to the house and found a very tired old woman, Mrs. Sarah Cohen, waiting for her to get there. ""Where's your money, Rita"" she asked, ""I've been waiting and waiting. What happened? Do you have it?"" ""Yes, I have it"" said Rita Cohen. ""I'll just wait for you at my house"", Mrs. Cohen said.

B2,"Style Merchants Style informs every part of our lives today from clothes to interior decoration and accessories. Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion. Ned Ingham: Dress Designer Ned Ingham makes dreamy romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles' he explains. 'They want a romantic look and for the moment the word ""traditional"" seems to mean the old English way of doing things.' 
  
 Style Merchant Ned Ingham's wedding dresses are all designed to take the stress out of the occasion by'removing the pressure of the day.' With an elegant 'no-sew' process, they all come in an elegant range of colours and fabrics which go with most homes. They offer a 'bespoke' service including an initial consultation and a 'custom build' for a bespoke dress. Ned Ingham: 'They've been wonderful and it's really gone out of control. It's like a huge circus with people from all over the world coming and making this all about fashion.' 
  
 Style Merchant Ned Ingham has many customers in the north of England, Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland who 'come to us because they don't want to spend thousands of pounds on a big-day dress and find that they don't like it.' He believes that people have got used to dressing to impress and that many people have 'lost confidence in themselves' which is a big reason for so many people 'wearing something that they don't like.' 
  
 Style Merchant Ned Ingham believes that too much material in the dress can be very 'distracting' and he thinks that simple, soft fabrics are in vogue, such as tulle, satin and lace"
B2,"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. In such a situation, knowing how to deal with a child who has artistic ability will undoubtedly play a key part in making learning music accessible and enjoyable. What are the typical challenges faced by parents and teachers of exceptionally gifted students? One of the major hurdles for music teachers is to know how to deal with an extremely gifted child. A child who is excellent in a particular subject is most unlikely to change their talents until they have learnt something useful to do with them, be it sport or some other activity. For example, when music teachers ask a child with great skill for example to sit down for an hour a day for a couple of weeks, they often get a very 'busy' response that they just can't do. One or two lessons a week may seem to be all they can handle, although most children can do at least several hours per week well and with success. The important thing, however, is for them to continue to practise, whether they can do that for several hours or not, as this is the only way they are likely to acquire mastery of their interests. A gifted child is unlikely to develop if they do not see what they are doing as work. The child must believe that it is something to do and not just something they enjoy doing. They should also feel that what they are doing is important to their future and not something just to pass the time until they can have a more free time. It's not possible to spend too much time with a gifted child without them"
B2,"A NEW LIFE The Farmer Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm. 'After 14 years in business I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. I wanted to have a go at farming but I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to do it as long as I had. I'd been a City man my whole life and I had to take a step back and think of myself and my kids. I didn't realise it then but that would be the beginning of a new chapter of my life. I thought that I could farm for a year and I would try and see how I was, and what I needed. But by the end of the first year, I knew that I wanted to be a farmer. It became very much of the future for me, as the business had gone. I always liked sheep and goats and thought that farming would be a good way to enjoy life. I bought a farm of 24 sheep and a cow and began breeding my own sheep. At first I took sheep to people's houses, as they liked having them. Over the years I've gone to friends' and neighbors' and even started to put a few through training at the local livestock shows. I do this because I love the challenge of it and because I think that people need a reminder that they can still be a part of the countryside. The livestock show is one of my favorite events because it allows the farmers to get together and get out and socialize. But above all, the livestock shows allow me to meet some really nice people. I even teach some of the farmers how to use the internet and the latest technology. I always enjoy"
B2,"Drop me a line! In our fast world of phones fax machines and computers the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing altogether. Yet to me there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival the pleasure of seeing who it is from and finally the enjoyment of the contents. So, in a world in which we are constantly being bombarded by emails, phone calls, faxes and text messages how can we maintain our personal connections?
My answer lies in the fact that the only way to keep our own letters alive is to collect them and to preserve them. There is no reason why a letter is better than a text message or email. If we collect our letters and hold them, they retain their original characteristics and they will live on long after the medium that carried them has gone. I have never been able to send or receive email or text messages so the only way for me to keep my letters is to save them digitally and to hand them in to the local post office.
Letters should be preserved as a part of our cultural heritage. They should never become obsolete and should never be lost. With this in mind I have started the Save The Post Office campaign, inviting all my followers to support me in this quest.

We fixed it for four people - read how it went.Sue and Bob visited their parents. They always get on well but Sue is often more sensitive than Bob. This year was no exception. She had just come out of a meeting when her parents heard her complain about something. Bob looked over to see his daughter in despair. They did something about it.
After Sue’s parents finished their discussion Sue walked over to Bob and asked if he would swap places with her for one day. He was happy to oblige.
They were both shocked when Sue took over. They agreed that they didn’t know what they were doing and Sue was much more relaxed and friendly than Bob.
Sue invited Bob over for a glass of wine after dinner. Bob had brought his guitar and played for his wife and daughter. Sue enjoyed the music. She and Bob both agreed that they will swap lives again when they retire.
I took over a neighbour’s house for a day. It was an interesting experience. I knew all of the house rules. My landlord’s girlfriend lived with them. She gave me a list of rules to follow. I was on my own with the cleaning, the garden work and the cooking. I made myself as comfortable as I could.

C1,"Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country says Georgina Ferry but she is little known For the past four years I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. If asked who is Dorothy Hodgkin I answer: She is the only woman scientist to have won a Nobel prize. My friends and acquaintances then ask who the others are and say: None other than Stephen Hawking, Sir Richard Branson, Paul Farmer, Peter Wright and many more I say: none of them is a woman. They say: Oh, well there you go"".It’s a test that has no answers and is a mystery to most people. It should be an easy question to answer for people who are well acquainted with the work of Dorothy Hodgkin. It is not. How could it be? Why, she was a woman, of course!
People with a vague familiarity with Hodgkin’s name probably know she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her research into radiation damage to the skin. If they understand that this was her most significant contribution to science, they probably also know she was born in Yorkshire in 1897 and that she lived most of her life in London. Some might know that she was educated at the Royal Academy of Music, won a scholarship to King’s College London and, after studying medicine at the Royal Free Hospital, joined the London Clinic in 1931. A few may be aware of her friendship with Wilfred Owen and that she helped found The British War Dead Association. Most will, however, know nothing about her research at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Experimental Radiology.

Here she is interviewed by Joanna Watt There cannot he many artists who l10 not sign their work unless they are asked to. Sarah Janson a trompe-l'oeil artist is one. Her paintings are designed to deceive. Under her spell, you can actually see the world as it was. If Sarah were to go to the museum to display one of her paintings you would not know it was a fake. The artist paints a picture of a real place with objects in the foreground and background which make it look like the real world. In one of her paintings she has installed a large mirror in which she can see herself. Sarah Janson is one of the very few artists to have such a large mirror in their studio. Her paintings are usually on canvas and covered in a thin layer of glass, so they do not look real. In this case she has painted a miniature picture of a real place. She then shows the picture to the spectator, in this case Joanna Watt, who can't see or feel anything. The spectator, not realizing the picture was a fake, is surprised when the painting is put up for display. But when she sees the tiny mirror in the top right corner of the painting she knows immediately that she has been tricked. The mirror gives her a sense of being in the painting; she sees herself as a character in the painting. She becomes completely immersed in the painting and can hardly notice that there is a spectator. Her painting is really an illusion and the mirror only shows her what is in the foreground and background. Although it is obvious that Joanna Watt does not understand what is going on, she remains amazed by the whole experience. Sarah Janson is"

In a feat of considerable literary skill the author has created a world with its own history traditions and customs. In the course of the series and in book II he makes extensive use of a unique kind of humour, which the author says he finds in his youth. For his efforts a prize of 10 000 EUR was awarded in 2012. This volume consists of the first book and the second book.
Voltaire's La Reine des Anges: The Life and Death of Catherine de Medici in the Age of Revolution, 1558 - 1559 contains the entire biography of Catherine the Great and the first half of that of Louis XIII with annotations and comments by a leading French intellectual of the time, Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
F.G.E's biography of Napoleon contains a series of articles which together form the basis of the entire work. His personal view was a factor of his career. The result of the French Revolution, which was the beginning of the Napoleonic era and the overthrow of the monarchy, was the final collapse of French culture, which took place in 1815. The book is divided into three sections. The first section, covering the years 1793 to 1797, deals with Napoleon's activities. The second section, dealing with the years 1801 to 1810, concerns the last years of his life, when he lost the Battle of Waterloo. The third part covers the Napoleonic Wars, which were in a way an intellectual triumph of France.

C1,"A trumpet isn’t just for Christmas… It is strange how many musicians even leading ones come from homes without music. Out of the blue Hakan Hardenberger the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world’s trumpet-players today. The origin of his talent is so obvious that many are ashamed to admit it.
When Hacin’s mother took him on a trip she found him playing the trumpet. So much that she asked him to play the national anthem of the entire nation as the closing notes of the concert. He did it and in return he was the only one in the audience who could actually play the very instrument he had just tried out. ‘This was a dream for me,’ said Hacin, ‘and it still is. Playing the trumpet is my life now. I never sleep well without my instrument.’
‘In my day we were not ashamed to talk about a trumpet. Everyone, even teachers, would admit that, not playing it, they could not tell the difference between a trumpet, a clarinet, a flute, a trombone, a saxophone or even a saxophone.’ 
‘Why did the trumpet come to become such a taboo?’ Asked Hans Holger Bredow.
Hakan replied with a smile, ‘Because our ancestors had a lot of it. And our music teacher at the beginning in our secondary school had only one word of advice: “Please don’t play that, it sounds very vulgar.” So, even he himself had to grow up in the shadows with the other instruments.’

A. HENLOW GRANGE I welcomed the opportunity to go to Henlow Grange for six days as I was tired and needed to relax. The place is situated on the edge of the picturesque village of Henlow, near Exeter, which is 40 minutes away. The farmhouse where I was staying was also set in a garden and it was lovely to see a wide range of flowers. One of the things I really liked most there was the fireplace that the owners had installed. The other interesting aspect of the place is the fact that all the chickens, ducks and pigs are kept in the field that is located outside. I have not seen any of them but they seem to be healthy and happy. There are a large number of plants in the garden. For example, there are two bluebells, a chaste tree and over 200 species of plants from around the world. I found myself surrounded by nature, but I also found myself in a beautiful, comfortable hotel with high-quality meals. The hotel is located in a very quiet residential area. Its garden is an attractive location, which I think people who are interested in quiet family life will appreciate. The hotel has a restaurant, which is open to members of the public on a weekdays and a member’s only on weekends. There are also an indoor swimming pool and a tennis court. I really liked the restaurant because it was an informal atmosphere where people could talk and enjoy themselves. The restaurant is open in the morning from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and again from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. The prices there"

 The next night, at nine o’clock, Charles was soundly asleep. But he wasn’t. He was wide awake.

C1,"Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work. A. What makes a good leader? A leader is one who inspires an agent of change a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better as the early theorists believed.

Some personality traits that will help you to become a great leader are:  A sense of fairness  A sense of urgency and focus  A sense of confidence  A sense of responsibility and commitment  A sense of communication  A sense of ethics  
  A strong sense of leadership  A strong sense of accountability   A strong sense of team dynamics   A strong sense of empathy  A strong sense of self-actualization  A strong sense of values  A strong sense of responsibility  A strong sense of trustworthiness

C1,"Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession A The rules for work are changing We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are or by our training and expertise but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the key to successful working. It is the ability to cope with change, and to manage people, relationships and organisational challenges. As psychologists have long recognized, EQ can be developed and maintained. The knowledge and skills are not innate - it can be learned by effort, practice, application and improvement. There are skills and traits that will build EQ, which are also known as emotional skills, emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills or, most often, soft skills. To be at one's best at work, you need to have at least one of these. EQ may be a lifelong effort or a skill that can be learned but, if it is not maintained, it is lost and can impact on your work life. There are various academic texts on this topic but the two most important are Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence - The Keys to Success, which examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession, and Emotional Intelligence by Susan Cain, whose compelling personal story of becoming a better leader and manager changed how I think about the importance of this skillset for leaders and teams. Goleman has built an interesting thesis from research conducted in over 100 organisations around the world. The organisations include major companies such as AT&T and Google, many medium sized businesses like The Economist, various institutions and several not-for-profit organisations. He explains how companies that have been successful are ones that have developed emotional intelligence within"

Since I started my career almost seven years ago, I have traveled to different cities in Europe like London, Paris, Madrid, Munich, Frankfurt, etc. Some of the cities I have visited are Amsterdam, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Madrid, Geneva, etc. I also went to France a few times and visited Nice, Cannes, and all other popular tourist destinations in the country. On the off days, I love to play tennis and watch my favourite cricket team, the Indian cricket team. If I am not on the field or at work, I like spending my free time with my friends, family and watching films or TV shows. I am married with a daughter and she is five years old. My husband and I have been together for six years. Our daughter loves to watch us on TV and likes to tell us what we do when we are at work. I would love to expand my professional horizon and travel across the globe. I believe the journey to new heights is always a matter of choice and not a limitation. If I have to choose one aspect that will influence my career for the next 7 to 10 years, it will be my love for education, as the way we are taught nowadays cannot be understood by our children. It is important for young people to be prepared to make a long and challenging journey for life, if they want to learn how to learn, how to teach and most importantly how to get a job. I believe knowledge is power. And power is always associated with love."
C1,"Sound the Alarm Stuart Harris reports Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Here's an attempt to find out. The radio-shop has opened, the traffic has been stopped, and I'm sitting in the small waiting-room of an English hospital. 
  
 I'm waiting to see if my name has been included on the register of donors for my brother's third-stage cancer, in which the cancer cells have spread to the brain. 
  
 I'm waiting for the results. 
  
 If it is positive, I won't lose my brother - even though all the indications are that he will die of this disease in a month's time. But if it is negative, I lose him in a week. The doctor says that, for a week at least, we can keep talking about it and the family can prepare for the worst. There is no point pretending things aren't going to be tough. But, still, the most important thing is to spend time with him while he is still alive. 
  
 We had a chat for a while today, about what the family and friends are going to do to keep him comfortable. I'm taking him to my mother's house. Then we will both take a turn of an hour's swimming in the hospital pool.

I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn’t have any summers. Why? Because, instead of turning up a heating in the living room, I had a heat lamp. Yes, that is the case! So for ten days every year, I lived in cold. In the summer, it did not feel much. At that time, when I lived in Sweden with my wife and daughter, it was always hot. I do not know whether you can still do that but it is worth a try. One thing that I could not have without any heating, is a TV. I had my own TV in my childhood. You will have to ask my parents but I think I watched it all the time. Yes! It was much more fun than sitting on a sofa reading or watching the telly. We had a big one with a satellite dish and a small one with a record player. And if you want to be on the safe side, you did not leave the children at home. They got to know what my grandparents did. I have a copy of my father’s diary from 1939. The diary is full of letters from school. My grandfather was a railway mechanic and worked all the time. He took my father to school in the winter and gave him a pair of boots when they were cold. And when it was hot we went to the swimming pool and he cooked a barbecue. And, as a rule, my father spent the winter playing chess with his friends. This was not a sport that our parents permitted for young people. My father wrote"

C1,"Hide and Seek Yvonne Coppard Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game — surveillance of a suspicious bookshop — when she realises that one of its rare customers is her Uncle Jim. He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard. But in this final confrontation she realises that her uncle is not only an unsavory conman, but also a manipulative, lying and deceitful man who has lost her trust. And so it ends. This production features the original UK cast of 2010, backed with the same stellar orchestra that sang the UK recording of the play. Set against the backdrop of Cornwall, the play takes its name from its central character, a beautiful but troubled lady. In her late 40s and with her family ailing, her cousin Yvonne Coppard takes up the family business, finding the homely Yvonne Coppard’s uncle to be a suitable heir to the family business. And she is certain that, while Jim will do a good job, Yvonne herself would be an excellent successor. Jim is charming, with a wonderful personality and, more than that, charming in his dishonesty and deceit. He is also a gambler, in love with a married young woman named Mrs. Dacre, and a womaniser, who lives in a house that has not been lived in for decades and who owns a large collection of art. The other characters in the play are equally unlikable, with Mr. Dacre’s wife an unrepentant alcoholic, and the young Mr. Burdett an ambitious but morally ambiguous man. This performance is accompanied by a stellar orchestra, conducted by Richard Williams with the original London cast in mind. It's a lovely accompan"
C1,"P. D. James Barbara Michaels meets the acclaimed crime writer whose innocent exterior hides a complex and brilliant imagination. Best-selling crime writer P.D. James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase as a headmistress of a girls' school. James has been the mainstay of the British crime fiction scene for over 50 years and her books are now on sale in over 100 countries, earning her the adoration of millions. She has also published twenty other novels, screenplays and articles. And now she has written the screen adaptation of her long-running series “Fingersmith”, a murder mystery featuring the detective Agatha Christie’s “Fingersmith” character. Agatha Christie, a writer of sensational murder mysteries, was the inspiration for James’s “Fingersmith” heroine. In this book, the eponymous heroine, Elizabeth Fingersmith, must solve a murder on the streets of London in order to prevent her own demise. But is it really the case that a man is playing with his own life? Or is it a case of suicide? Who are the suspects? What can be ascertained from the police log? This is a murder mystery of international importance that has never been made into a film. Barbara Michaels, best known for “Catherine the Great”, has been named the recipient of the highest English award for fiction-writing, the Booker Prize. She was the winner of the Newbery Medal in 1994 for the same title. James’s crime mysteries and thrillers have sold more than 120 million copies and won awards worldwide. In the United States James’s books are translated into English, German, French and Spanish and in the"

Training and competition leave little time for a normal life so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records. A female swimmer was even in the news recently for beating the world record in the 200-metre breaststroke with a time of 2:23.29. She had no chance of beating the previous record as a little girl. A lot of girls are too small and weak and cannot swim fast but for this woman it was a matter of pride. In another sport, the female football players have been given the same status as male players. Women earn as much as the men so why not pay them equally? And even if a football player is injured, she can still play in a match. The players are paid well and the money can be used for other purposes as well, like the development of the women's game. We should give all sports equal status and pay the women equally so they can be equally good at any sport.

C1,"BRINGING UP BADGERS ‘What now?’ was my immediate thought as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‘open farm’ six years ago we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. Today we were dealing with a particularly squashed rabbit. 
  
 It was a grey, short haired rabbit. I assumed it was a male as he was a little fatter than the female. I wasn’t right. I wasn’t at all sure how old the rabbit was, but the face was unmistakably female and the skin underneath was not only a little dry and scuffed but also had several brown and blue streaks. It was squashed. 
  
 As one of our helpers scooped up the rabbit, I reached for my camera and looked at it. I tried to understand its features as I held the tiny, wrinkled creature so the lens couldn’t ruin its appearance. 
  
 “What now?” I said again and then looked at the woman holding my camera. She turned away and did her thing. “I’m going to run and get a new lens for my camera,” she said. “Will you catch that rabbit for me, please?” 
  
 I nodded, got the lens and waited. When I came back I saw the rabbit still held by the woman. “Oh thank you so much. Thank you very much indeed.” 
  
 After we’d got him the camera lens, we carried the animal down the farm and placed it in a pen. We’d hoped"
C1,"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. If this is the case, then publishers are happy to take on the responsibility for reviewing new releases and keep an eye on the reviews. In general, we get lots of email after a book is released from publishers and they often ask us to review it, if only because they've read it. Sometimes they contact us because they feel that we are an 'official' review organiser. This usually means that we are able to get a book for free, in exchange for a fair and honest review. Sometimes we are asked to review a book just because the publisher knows a very influential bookseller, who then sells copies to that bookseller. In the first case, the book is reviewed to promote it, as part of the publishers publicity plans. In the second, the publisher simply wants to sell copies of the book, and doesn't mind if the bookseller is friends with the bookseller. Some publishers ask us to review a book at their expense if they know of a review organiser who has already reviewed it, and who will then recommend the book to other retailers. If we had reviewed a book the way we recommend we would be recommending it in the first place, and they wouldn't need to put in any money at all! Our policy is that as long as the book has been released in the last two years, it has got at least one good review from at least one of the major print reviewers of the book in the newspaper's review organiser. We never give any recommendations for"
C1,"WEATHERVANE MAKER THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham’s designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. His weathervane is based on a classic design that he has used for years, but he is always keen to change or build something up to the latest trends or to explore something that wasn’t done before. For example, he has used stainless steel (previously only used in submarines) to make a new design. Graham is also very proud to say that the majority of his weathervanes are made entirely in Hampshire. He has three sites in Hampshire (a factory in Hampshire city of Winchester, a workshop in Standon and a workshop in Tonbridge). His most popular design is the Hounds Head, a traditional weathervane used widely in the coastal areas in the south west of England. Graham’s creations are handmade in Hampshire by a skilled woodworker. All wood is cut on site using modern machinery to ensure precise cuts are made. The weathervane is hand-finished and a range of finishes is available. All weathervanes are finished using a very thin layer of white wax to give them extra character. The weathervane is designed to resist the effects of sea salt. There are also a range of colours available to suit your needs. For more details and pictures see www.weatheredwoodworks.co.uk or phone (01432) 844444. There are other Hampshire locations where Graham does his weathervanes. The Woodcrafters in Tunbridge Wells specialise in handcrafted woodwork, including weathervanes. They also offer"
C1,"But he most regretted his denials that the industry aimed its advertising at teenagers. ""We spent millions studying kids. We knew that they could name the three most advertised brands of cigarettes. We knew that almost 90 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands. And I knew that if we could get the rest of the country to see it our way, the public would be surprised about the tobacco industry's real purpose. So I lied to everybody."" He added: ""If we just started advertising the truth, we wouldn't be having this debate today. The truth is that cigarette companies market to kids all day long. And we have known this since the 1950s, and yet we do nothing to stop it."" 
  
 In fact, the government had helped get the cigarette industry off the hook. The Food and Drug Administration and the health professionals responsible for warning the public of the dangers of tobacco, like the Surgeon General, used words to describe the tobacco industry's tactics in language that would resonate. A Surgeon General's report in 1974 stated clearly that: ""The American public is still not aware that there are other risks involved in smoking other than smoking."" The report noted that there are other dangers--including diseases like cancer, emphysema, lung and heart disease, and even heart attack and stroke--that are caused by smoking. (In fact, the Surgeon General has made many of his statements available on the Internet.) 
  
 As long as cigarette advertising had been allowed to appear in newspapers, magazines and on television, the public's ignorance had been protected. The tobacco industry had been able to market its products as ""the cool thing to do"" for teenagers while ignoring the risks. The public had been"

When I arrived at Mr Jaggers's office the clerk told me that he was in court and that he had left word I should wait in his room. He led me to a dark room. Mr Jaggers was not there. The door to this room was on the other side of the office, so I knocked loudly. There was no answer. I turned to leave and noticed Mr Jaggers's silver necklace on the floor. A policeman answered the door. I was so excited that I gave my statement and we left immediately. There is no doubt that Mr Jaggers's necklace is the clue to solve the case of the missing king. You will surely enjoy the story.
""Have a look at this!"" He said holding a large, silver necklace. I didn't want to leave him disappointed so I said: ""Is it yours?"" He nodded. I put it on and I was very happy. And for the first time in my life, I understood how much the king's necklace meant to the queen of England.
""You think you have solved the case?"" I asked him. His look told me he knew exactly what he was doing. That evening Mr Jaggers returned to his office, but the news was not good. The queen had died and there was a strange incident at court: the king was accused of murder! There would be no trial. Everyone knew that he could not be innocent. ""What's wrong with that story?"" I asked. ""It makes no sense, it could never have happened. But it's an easy way to get rid of the king.""

C1,"THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should combine old and new says Tom Cunliffe. And he put it into practice in his own craft 'The Westerman'. This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. It heralded the end of sail on the sea. But how are designs changing these days? Tom Cunliffe, one of our most successful designers of yachts for sport, leisure and competition, sat down to discuss this point. For us it was a great pleasure to have this discussion, as one of our designers, 'The Westerman' is one of the most interesting projects he's ever worked on. He was kind enough to send me a boat designed to showcase its full potential. The 'Westerman', as the name suggests, was based on a very old French boat of the same name. It was also designed in the shape of a westerly wind. The wind direction and velocity in these areas are not unlike our southern oceans in winter. In this boat there was a great deal of new technology and a lot of design experimentation. The boat has been designed to go across the wind in any direction. At some stage it may even find its way across the Channel - perhaps as far as Scotland? For us, the boat of my dreams is an ultra light and ultra fast vessel. The vessel should combine an old boat design with a new boat design. It should have all the comfort and luxury of the latest boat but at the same time it should be extremely fast and manoeuvrable across the sea. The 'Westerman' is one of Tom's most interesting designs and one that shows how the old and new have merged. This yacht is built to be"
C1,"Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards. All hedgehogs are carnivorous, although the hedgehogs living in the United States mostly eat insects. Unlike other rodents, the hedgehog only has five teeth, with the four remaining ones being called the ""claws"".  This is the largest species of hedgehog, and the only one native to Australia. It is one of three species of hedgehog. When eating, the hedgehogs use its front teeth to scrape the food from the ground and to dig up the dirt. They use its back teeth to break the flesh into small pieces. As with all hedgehogs, a hedgehog's scent is carried by its body and remains on the ground. It has been said that they are able to identify their scent because it ""smells like home"".    Unlike other hedgehogs, they are nocturnal, so they sleep in underground burrows. They dig their burrows in the ground at a height of about 3m, which makes it difficult for predators to discover their burrows. When in their burrow, they usually lie down to sleep, and may stop occasionally to eat, drink or defecate. When disturbed, they roll up into a ball and remain in this position for several seconds so that they can scratch at their back or side with their spines. It will then roll into another ball and continue to roll over and over in this manner until it is stopped by another hedgehog. This makes it easy for others to find the hedge"
C1,"Blacksmiths THROUGHOUT the ages iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers because they were the sole providers of weapons armour and farming tools. In a world of few other jobs they were able to make a living from creating artefacts that were the most practical and useful for their day. The work of blacksmiths has been transformed by the Industrial Revolution and many of them are now considered to be inanimate objects. The most famous example of this is the Royal Armouries but most of the work for these establishments is carried out by private companies. The skills and art of blacksmiths are on display today in museums around the world and this article gives a taste of the history and techniques they have used and the artifice and technology behind some of the best-known pieces of Iron Age weaponry.
1. The most famous bronze arm and leg armour was the Black Knight. This piece was a gift to the Romans from the king of the Visigoths and was later presented to the Britons by the Romans. The sword was made of two separate pieces of iron and it had an extended and curved edge. By the time of the Anglo Saxons there were three main techniques for working iron. One was smelting, the other was cutting and the third was rolling. All three of these methods had their own advantages and disadvantages. Smelting was the most common technique but it was expensive and could only be used on a very small scale because you had to have a smelter ready to use. Cutting was not as precise and was therefore harder to complete. Finally, rolling was the least expensive and could only be used by the"

""The idea that this museum, which is the biggest tartan museum in the world, can't do it properly with one of the biggest collections is really quite ridiculous,"" he tells the BBC, saying many items weren't in proper condition. ""This is an opportunity for us to bring the collection together and do something much more lasting than just a display case,"" he says. While the museum's collection is impressive, the BBC notes that not many outside Scotland even know about it. ""While we're very conscious that everyone in Scotland can enjoy our collections, we also have to think carefully about where we put them, if anyone is going to know where they are, and how many people are going to"
C1,"In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr Toby Clark a researcher at the British Geological Survey aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. But how much did he know of the cosmos? Anjana Ahuja reports. Credit:AP Sir Edmund Halley was born in 1656 at the Norfolk estate of a wealthy merchant of Norfolk. He was the eldest son of Sir William Halley, and the younger son of Sir Thomas Thorneycroft. As well as the comet, he had been an accomplished astronomer, who published a number of papers and books. He had, too, an intimate knowledge of the world around him. As a student at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was influenced by his teacher, John White, he was attracted to natural history. There he was also influenced by two men, the first, William Harvey, the author of the famous Naturalis Historia, and the second, Dr Thomas More, who had recently left the Royal Society to found the new order of things, the New School for Art and Science. It was Harvey who advised Halley to pursue his scientific interest, something that led to his discovery of the comet. He used Halley's comet as the foundation for his studies, as it was the brightest and most constant object visible for three centuries, beginning in 1687. It remained bright until it died out with a very weak illumination in 1883. During the period of discovery Halley also experimented with the movement of the Earth and its seasons, discovering variations in the north and south poles. He also observed stars. The sky was the study of astronomy for Halley. But it was"

C1,"Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott shares with his readers the mystical experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent: the Seven Summits. My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I will take them in the order of my climbing them. A. Mt. Aconcagua, Argentina. B. Mt. Kanchenjunga, Tibet. C. Mt. Lhotse, Tibet. D. Mt. Everest, Tibet. E. Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. F. Mt. Lhotse, Tibet. G. Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. H. Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. I. Mt. Marape, Papua New Guinea.
In July 2009, Doug Scott became the first person in history to summit all seven summits in a single, complete climb. He accomplished this incredible feat by summiting every high point of every mountain on the planet! Doug is my hero!
When I discovered Doug, he was the host of the popular Mountaineer TV show. He was the anchor of several TV show climbing mountains in different parts of the world. I was deeply impressed with his passion for the mountains and in particular with his quest to conquer the Seven Summits. So, I began to keep a watchful eye on the Mountaineer TV site.
At first, I had been somewhat skeptical about Doug’s journey. His climb was to be published as a book by Mountaineers Book Press and I was skeptical that a person who had summited all the summits would give up so quickly. Also, since he had summited the Seven Summits and had a clear-cut goal of climbing every high point on each continent, I was"
C1,"Photographing People People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations the photographer has to be conscious of actions gestures and expressions. We often look at photographs taken on our phone or computer screen and see people behaving in a boring way. What we are missing is the human interest and attention paid to the people in the photograph, just as they are looking at us.

C1,"The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her in action. One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. Her fellow inspectors are even further oblivious. But Chris has no intention of letting things go to waste. And neither do the guests, who continue to pour in, looking forward to the experience of a lifetime at the Globe Hotel. Until they arrive and realize that everything is not what it seems. Chris and her inspectors are just one link in a chain of a series of events that will eventually bring the hotel crashing to the ground.
This was a great read. I really enjoyed reading Sue Brown's series and enjoyed this one as well. I liked that she was very fair when judging hotels and made her own judgments to what hotels should and shouldn't be doing.
The hotel inspector's name was Sue Brown.
I really enjoyed reading her reviews and thoughts, she had some funny ideas and thoughts, and was really fair. That being said, there were a few times she made poor decisions in hotels, and it didn't make for a good read. I really liked the books and would recommend them to someone wanting to know what happened at the Globe Hotel.
This was a fun read. I liked the characters in this one, especially Sue Brown, the hotel inspector. She had a lot of personality, and was able to describe the hotel well. She also helped give insight to what actually happened at the hotel. I also liked how she was able to make her own judgements and not follow what the hotel did. There were a few times when she was a little close-minded, but"
C1,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support If you applied for a job in some countries you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting as much as anything else that would determine your suitability for the job. Yet despite all this, handwriting is under severe threat. For years, the professional body that regulates it has encouraged the use of computerised systems to analyse letters sent for marking. It is now, it seems, at last willing to take action. Last week the Professional Standards Authority, an arm of the professional body for doctors, announced its intention to introduce handwriting assessments to check doctors’ competencies. The authority’s chief executive, Stephen Hough, said that handwriting could prove useful as a quick means of finding out whether a practitioner’s style was suitable for a job. Writing is the pen, and we tend to recognise the pen as having some authority in our lives. We associate the signature on the banknote with an individual, and so even though there are numerous ways of presenting one’s identity, most of us still recognise our signatures when they are seen on letters. However, when handwriting is analysed in an organisation, it can reveal many things that we do not know about the person who is writing. Many organisations recognise the role of the boss by assessing the type of penmanship of their employees. If an employee uses a specific type of pen, a stamp will appear on her letter or email to show that her signature is from the company. But handwriting can provide more information. In fact, there are many systems in use to assess the quality of a person’s handwriting. And while some systems are more successful than others, all are gaining in popularity, as"
C1,"Volunteer tourism Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. A. It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. Nevertheless, international voluntary work benefits development by providing employment for local people, thereby allowing them to gain livelihood. And there is, of course, a link to an individual’s identity. In terms of personal development, volunteering offers the opportunity to become a more skilled worker. Volunteers also provide moral support to those who need it. These are the reasons why the World Health Organization considers volunteer tourism to be good practice in the development of human resources. Moreover, international volunteering brings economic benefit. It raises a country’s standard of living. Volunteering is often done as a way of helping others, which in turn may be beneficial to an individual. International volunteering can also provide a solution to a country’s development problems and reduce poverty. Although some may argue that this type of volunteer tourism is damaging to local communities, it will not be in the long run. Indeed, this kind of tourism is beneficial because it can help develop a country in which many people need it. For example, in the case of Cambodia it might help rebuild its tourism industry. There is, of course, a limit as to how much money each volunteer can make, but the potential for such tourism is enormous. The idea that international voluntary tourism can only help the local population and not the tourists should, I think, be discouraged. We have a global problem of poverty and unemployment. Local people of developing countries must develop to meet that demand. That’s why international volunteer tourism should be encouraged. The more local"
C1,"A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They are not meant to be real sculptures but to present an accurate impression of the originals. The museum has a wonderful example of a statue of the Greek god Neptune (from ‘Neptunium’) which looks like it was made in Rome. The museum is housed in a wonderful building in the centre of Nicosia and the entrance to the museum is through a glass facade on to a magnificent lawn. The building itself was used during WWII to accommodate refugees from Britain, after the bomb damaged the National Museum of Greek Archaeology. The museum has a very nice reception area that includes a small theatre and a library. The museum is open all year round for guided tours, both public and academic. There are two entrances. One is on the central boulevard of the Nicosia promenade and the other is on the backside of the University (which is on a different street). The entrance to the museum is not very secure as it is on a main road and the gate is not locked.

B. Antakthete The Antakthete was built in the 15th century in the style of the Ottoman Empire and became the headquarters of the local Greek diaspora. This is one of the main attractions of the city. The main street of the town is very busy with cars and pedestrians and it is often closed to traffic. It is a real treat to enjoy a walk along the main street of Antakthete and to see the old style buildings"
C1,"Are you too nice for your own good? When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity. 'I'm so sorry' I beamed when I dropped the plate on the floor and it smashed into smithereens.
But then came the next day when an unhappy customer came through the door and I was in a dilemma. As I looked at the customer's angry face with red blotches on his eyes and saw he had only taken a small bite out of his sandwich, I knew my smile was no longer a suitable defense against his anger.
The restaurant's owners had given me a training course on how to look tough and polite without being too aggressive or rude. The best way to show them that you are not afraid to speak your mind was to smile and pretend you were feeling better than you were.
But a customer should always be treated with respect, and a smile alone isn't a solution. We also have to consider whether the customer deserves our attention with the way he acts. If he does not behave like he should and he does not say what's on his mind, then I think he deserves to be given no smile at all. And even if he does, if it is only to show that he likes my smile, he should not be told how to smile - it's up to him.
But maybe our boss is like this too: I was helping with a project that I had never done before. The client was asking me to do all kinds of things on top of my regular duties: I had to write a report and send it to another place. If that wasn't enough I also had to do the rest of the job, which was not exactly easy. It was not"
C1,"Science flying in the face of gravity Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964 a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. Inside however, were a number of cutting edge technological features. It was the first aircraft to carry scientific instruments which would use the weightlessness. He showed them the weightless control panel where they could select a weight and gravity would act on it and move it to where it was needed. Then he showed them how a camera could be placed at a height where gravity would pull the camera downward and film the action from above. He concluded that there would be many more ways to fly in the future. Students were particularly excited by the possibility of flying in a space station which would have several hundred passengers living on board. However, they were less enthusiastic about the idea of travelling in spaceships around the world, which might not be as possible with the current technology. They all agreed, however, that the future would likely be very different. The main points to take home from the film were that they wanted to design ways of using weightlessness for testing a number of technologies. That weightlessness would be used to travel long distances over huge distances. They seemed to think that scientists would have the ability to fly around the Earth in just a matter of days, rather than years. They seemed to think that they would be able to operate underwater cameras which would record the changes in the surface of the planet, and observe the evolution of life. But they weren't sure that the world's scientific organisations would be able to pay for the expensive instruments they would need to fly to different areas of the planet to carry out these"
C1,"The day I drew Picasso Richard Cork recalls how as an 78-year-old student he came face-to-face with one of the most revered artists of the century. Even seen at a distance eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an I8-year-old student filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. A wealthy French art dealer spotted our advertisement in the Daily Express and was soon calling on me to paint the famous artist. As the years passed I was promoted to become a senior illustrator and by then I knew a thing or two about the work of the masters of modern art. In 1961 my wife Irene and I visited a dealer’s show in London and fell in love with a work by the mysterious Paul Klee. It was this that led us to travel extensively throughout Europe, visiting the works of a number of artists. By this time our family had grown to include two boys. Richard Cork: Art and War is a gripping history of the art world as it was experienced during the first years of the second world war. A fascinating journey through Paris, New York, Venice and Madrid, it chronicles the early years of the war, when the art world was rocked by the shocking news of the Allied invasion of Normandy. As we witnessed the rise of American art in America and British art in Europe I was fascinated by the new art movement inspired by Klee, who worked with an extremely small group of friends, including Max Liebermann, Hans Hofmann and Georg Baselitz. I also found it fascinating that in a time of war artists often sought shelter in the homes of friends who were artists themselves. The book is peppered with entertaining anecdotes and quotes from such figures as Frank Lloyd Wright, Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Paul Klee. In the final chapter"
C1,"Hit and miss of mass marketing AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.
The internet is changing advertising forever.

The growth of the internet has created an advertising medium that is fundamentally different from the traditional.

The medium that has been created on the internet is so new and untested that it cannot be predicted exactly what the outcome will be. The medium is changing at warp speed, and we don't even know exactly how much of the change will be for the better or worse.
One thing the internet can do that other media have not is to connect people.

The internet can not only bring people together in common interests but in many more ways than one.

One example is that it can link people to like-minded people. This has proved to be quite effective in marketing a product.

The ability to do this is due largely to the internet's flexibility, which allows brands to offer content that isn't available in traditional media, such as podcasts and video clips.

It is difficult to see how this can not be beneficial in advertising but as you know most of it is ""hit and miss"".  There is still a lot of work to be done. But it is a promising medium. And who knows, one day the internet may well transform advertising entirely.AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession.

They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? Is it true that the peacocks have the ability to change their train's design in an instant to better suit their changing surroundings? Are they the only one in the wild that can change their train? To better understand the evolution of the peacock, we will be spending a week observing their behaviour in the wild. Our tour guide will introduce us to the animals in the park and show us what to expect during the three day stay. Each evening we will watch a performance by the peacocks. Day two of the visit is reserved for our personal experience of life in the wild. We will see how our companions live and work in the wild, along with their diet and forage. We will see a troop of 20-30 peacocks and their chicks - the wild life of Whipsnade will become a very real and vivid part of our holiday. (This is not available for dogs)

Background The peacock is the fastest mammal in the world. It can run up to 20 mph, although it is not considered to be a very fast eater. Its tail is the second largest of any mammal. It is a monogamous breed - that is, it only raises one set of chicks from mating - and it lives for around"
C1,"NATURAL TALENTS In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees we haven’t had time to develop any differences: genetically we’re still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps. On this grand evolutionary scale whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. The earliest fossils of humans date from around 30 million years ago, so that puts human civilisation somewhere between 3 and 5 million years older than chimpanzees. Advertisement What are the chances that a different ancestor for man might have existed? To answer this question you have to look no further than your own family tree. In the human family tree, there are branches of descent starting at the top of the tree. These are mostly descended from the same ancestors. But from here, branches grow downwards until you have a branch that contains only living descendants. We are a branch of this tree. You can see that all of our descendants in this branch share the same ancestry as humans in their line of descent. This is known as the 99.9 per cent homologous association. To see how human ancestry developed we have to look backwards, down into the past. The early hominids who inhabited Africa probably didn’t have the same genetic makeup as our modern human ancestors. They probably had a different genetic makeup that had arisen from more than one branch of descent. For this reason it was possible for a group of hominids to split off from a different branch of descent. There is evidence, based on DNA samples taken from early hominids, that they lived in a different continent from Europe and Asia. If so, it is likely that this group of hominids became part of the genetic ancestry of modern humans, via a process called diploid evolution. However, the DNA of the early"

C1,"Chewing gum culture It’s fashionable classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day. Discover how an ancient custom became big business. Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. We look at a modern-day gum commercial where a guy shows how great he is, by chewing a chew. (The US has the highest rates of chewing gum consumption in the world.) The gum industry is big business with a total annual revenue of US$7 billion. But how is it that so many people are chewin away? The chewing habit has been observed in Europe for centuries, though it didn’t become fashionable until the 1800s. Chewing gum was first popularized by Captain William C. Perry in the US Navy. It is considered a mark of distinction for US Navy officers to chew gum, in accordance with their naval codes. Today, most navy ships still carry gum packs in their lockers and each member is encouraged to chew 2 sticks per day. 
  
 Chewing gum became popular in Britain after World War II. British servicemen and women in the British military have always liked to chew gum, but chewing gum has now become a common part of British army life. Soldiers who’ve deployed to Middle East countries chew as much as 50 sticks a day. Chewing gum isn’t just for comfort. It offers several health benefits to the users. For example, chewing gum releases a hormone called salivary hormone, which helps to reduce the risk of tooth decay and gum disease. Salivary hormone also reduces the absorption of caffeine from coffee and tea. Another benefit of chewing gum is the creation of saliva. Saliva helps to"

A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph The first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer and aspiring director. He was fired from his role as scriptwriter in the television series “The Thick of It” and he has no idea why. He is too busy with his movie debut as a film writer and a screenwriter. His first novel “Beginner Takes All” was published last May, which was the fastest in the English language and already became a bestseller. Evans was born in London in 1960. In the early seventies he worked as a scriptwriter and a film director in a company that handled the rights of American and British TV productions. In 1979 he wrote the first film script: “Fatal Attraction” starring Marilyn Monroe. Evans left the company in 1985 but not before he had written an outline for a feature film called “The Last Tycoon”, starring Nicolas Cage. And now Evans is back. He is working on another project: a TV series based on the novel “The Horse Whisperer” by the American Mark Twain (1875-1934). The new adaptation should be released next year. In between he wrote “Beginner Takes All” - the first book by the writer of the screenwriting team that has been winning lots of money from the sale of the rights. But Evans has more to worry about than the money. He is going to make his own television series that is not based on a novel. This will be the most difficult thing that he has ever done.

C1,"THEATRE CHARLES SPENCER A. Tamburlaine the Great Marlowe’s ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands’ staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe’s play with an exhilarating speed and physicality.
As Marlowe, Daniel Miller displays a ferocious energy and agility that is matched by a great emotional range that draws us into his journey. As the giant Sir Galahad, Ian Mathers, who also directed the first London production, is even more formidable. We follow his growth and transformation as he falls under the influence of the gods of the Old Testament and is drawn into a war against the Persians. As the giant Aeneas and his companions, he shows great comic energy and charm.
For a brief time we are in the mind of Marlowe, the man of the theatre. He knows where and when to be bold, where and when to be subtle. A great actor makes use of these choices. Hands does this with aplomb.
In his first role since 1992 as the Bard, Peter Capaldi does something wonderful. His Hamlet is possessed by the ghosts of the past but as the tragic hero, he retains a human quality that is not merely tragic but also heroic.
Marlowe’s play is rich with ideas. If Hamlet could never have loved his mother because of the curse that befell her, why did Mephistopheles kill his mother? Why did the Gods curse Hamlet? What made the gods angry with the old man for killing a woman who was already pregnant?
Why did Hamlet have to kill Polonius, the king of Denmark, when it would have been so much easier to"

C1,"The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. Hurst is a skilled cabinet maker but his greatest skill appears to be making life a little easier for those around him. Hurst runs a family business but lives modestly, never staying at a hotel or a posh restaurant. He drives a taxi and runs a pub in the local area. He is a man with a vision who believes that you do not have to have a lot of money or status to appreciate his work. But he seems a man in search of love, too: in this business you get what you pay for. Hurst makes a simple stool called the Fiddle-Stick which has been made to order by a local butcher for the local cricket club. It is made from a piece of a large ash tree, its branches fitted together and fastened together with red, thick, red, thick glue. It is made in a form that is comfortable to sit on, the legs curved into an oval shape that feels like it should cradle you. The simple structure of this stool is supported by thin legs, which provide some added comfort. It is decorated with red and white bunting and has a green cushion. The Fiddle-Stick has been used by various cricket club employees for about 40 years and has now been used in one final function. It will be used by the cricket club members for a cricket match during the week. A local artist paints a portrait of the Fiddle-Stick before it goes in the coffin. The Fiddle-Stick will"
C1,"Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain’s most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises. The first is Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral Southwell Minster celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. ‘The minster is a wonderful building to look at and the interior has a good ambiance. In the medieval times, it was a very important place because of its importance as the first Benedictine monastery in England,’ explains John Binns, executive director of the Southwell Museum.
Binns adds that at this site, ‘the local population were given the right to vote and Southwell formed part of Nottinghamshire. In 1232 it was granted to Thomas the Black Prince who held it until 1318. Now it’s a National Trust.’ Next door is Southwell Priory, which dates from the 12th century and was the first church built on the Priory Estate. The Priory House has been sympathetically restored to its former splendour by English Heritage. The estate covers 22,000 acres, including Southwell parish, the largest agricultural estate in Nottinghamshire. According to the English Heritage report, ‘The rich, open-plan structure of the property and its magnificent views to the surrounding countryside attract visitors from all over. There is always something to see and do here.’ What attracts visitors even more is the family’s vast interests in farming, particularly horse-riding and horse breeding. They were known as the Priory’s ‘Great Family’. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, land passed to the Priory, the family left a considerable estate"
C1,"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West? Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism massage diet manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions but acupuncture’s role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. Many Americans are skeptical of alternative medicine, but some patients with chronic pain might want to consider acupuncture. It is an alternative form of modern medicine. It does not replace any conventional treatment. In addition, unlike traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture uses pain relief as a primary objective, not merely for reducing discomfort. This article investigates Chinese acupuncture and whether it is a useful option for the treatment of chronic pain. The study used primary data on 4,835 patients. This research article is not only interesting from a clinical point of view, it’s a great example of research done in America. You’ll learn more about the history of acupuncture, the different Chinese remedies and its role in the treatment of chronic pain.

C1,"The December cover of Capitol Magazine featured Clay Carter looking rich and handsome in his expensive Armani suit. Inside there were pictures of him playing with a dog (borrowed from Rodney) standing proudly in empty courtrooms washing his new Porsche and standing on board his new boat in the Bahamas. I guess it was the right time to buy. But I wonder if he could make it through the summer without looking like he just stepped out of a magazine or movie. Is the way he looks in suits something he wants for the rest of his life?
This is my answer: I think the best thing for Clay to do now is to lose the suit and tie and just wear a t-shirt and baggy jeans to court. Maybe wear the same t-shirt all season. I don’t think he’ll look any worse for the wear, and he’ll look like one of the boys. A good way to get your name out there is to look good and play your best. Who wouldn’t want to watch a guy like that?
In my own case, I’m a huge fan of the way I look in my suit and tie. I’m not sure I would ever wear them out in the public, but they certainly add something special to me that’s not really present in any other part of my life.
What do you think of Clay Carter? Do you think he will ever make it through a whole season in just a t-shirt and jeans? Or is he stuck in a place where he will always need to show off his suit and tie?

Supermarkets know that fresh food is a premium for shoppers to pay, so their stores must be clean. Shopkeepers need to clean their store regularly, or else shoppers will notice it and will go elsewhere. If they don’t clean regularly the public will have a strong sense that it’s dirty and the shops will lose their appeal. This is why stores have had to start putting more time into cleaning, for both shoppers and for the storekeepers.

An art student of 31 devotee of historical romances she seeks Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances. When this happens she vows to marry the man whose knees she hasn’t ruined. A handsome Greek war veteran appears as she is having an affair with the mysterious Greek soldier. She soon has the Greek army in her sights; she marries and the man is killed. The Greek soldier has returned to live in his family home and Isabel and his family form a loving bond. But in a war they are constantly at war. And now we have the Greek soldier’s daughter who has become a rebel and has been captured. She has only one chance. So Isabel must go straight to the Greek soldier and win the love of her father who has fallen in love with her. What follows is a fascinating, funny, romantic journey of revenge and redemption. I felt sorry for Isabel. Her parents were in love but were not allowed to marry because of her fathers family. But she loved the Greek war veteran. Isabel has never been allowed to see the other side of things. She believed that everything was perfect in her parents relationship. Until the man she loves is killed. The man who is now her father. And in the process has killed her best friend and best man. And with that one act she has lost everything she ever loved. All she had ever wanted. But Isabel believes that the right man will come along. The book is a laugh riot. It involves pirates, a mermaid, a sailor, a gypsy and more and the humour and romance flows freely. Isabel’"
C1,"Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. There are several plausible theories. One would have us believe that sleeping is the ultimate sleep - a state whereby our bodies are totally relaxed and inert, giving our brain a rest and a chance to recuperate from the demands of day-to-day life. This sounds ideal, but a number of studies show that humans need at least one or two sleepless nights a month to stay productive and healthy. However, research shows that even this is not necessary for optimal functioning and mental well-being. Thus the main theory remains a mix of individual personality traits and biology - humans simply need to be able to function in both alert and relaxed states. But many studies have shown that a good night's sleep is important for our health and well-being. So, what can we learn from the findings of these studies? The aim of this study was to investigate whether a common sleep disorder can be treated successfully if the problem is caused by a problem with attentional control. Specifically, we compared the effectiveness of treatment with a cognitive therapy based on a cognitive therapy based on the principles of functional cognitive therapy. We carried out a randomized controlled trial of cognitive therapy for insomnia. It is clear that the effect of the therapy does not only depend on the nature of the disorder, but also on the individual’s individual temperament and personality traits. But there is still a way to go before we can start treating such people, if we want to do away with chronic insomnia as a chronic disorder. Therefore, we recommend"

We went to four contrasting offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist who studies people’s working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. Their advice is to ensure that you are designing healthy and happy workplaces.
We were interested in how the new generation feel working in office buildings. We asked a series of questions to see how the work-life balance is, how healthy and happy staff feel about their working conditions, and how happy workers feel about their workplace.
Are your chairs and cubicles comfortable and ergonomic?
In this building the chairs look a bit uncomfortable and the desks have a little plastic covering on them. The staff are happy in this office and have a good amount of time off.
This office is a bit more colourful and has a more open work environment. The building looks like a fun cafe with chairs in different shapes and a good variety of office furniture. The staff are happy here and have a good amount of time off.
This office has a much more closed environment, like the other three. The colour of the walls and the desks looks a bit boring and drab. The staff here don’t have a great amount of time off and are happy in the office.

C1,"THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING I thought everyone would be pleased but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. ‘What do you mean?’ she raged. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day life-long smoker and four hours later I was not was faintly irritating. For the rest of that day I thought that people might find it difficult to believe. I went to work the next day as I always did. People might not notice that I was different but I was sure that they would notice the change in my breath. But they didn’t. I was an efficient accountant, efficient by nature but it wasn’t the breath that concerned them. But one of them noticed. A young woman in the finance department was a keen smoker. She didn’t mind it when she was in front of her desk. It wasn’t a part of her work that she paid much attention to. But when I came back to work after a holiday she noticed the difference. She didn’t like it and didn’t wish to carry on. I think she liked the idea of her breath becoming stronger than it had ever been. But I wasn’t so sure. I was an efficient accountant but I was also aware that an unhealthy lifestyle could be unhealthy. I was the one who brought it up. A few days later she complained to me. ‘You have a strange look in your eye’ she said, ‘and your breath really doesn’t smell. It’s not what it used to be.’ I thought that was odd but the next day we had a meeting with the finance manager. It was a routine meeting and nothing much was said. But when we left the office he"
C2,"Writing by hand and on screen Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over.
This experience of using your brain to write by hand gives you a sense of your limitations. I am always conscious of the many ‘buts’ and ‘do’s’ in my prose, trying to remove them, adding or inserting punctuation or making up endings, because they seem to ‘hang around’ or are missing.
Good writing is a skill I have been working on since I was six years old. It’s a skill that requires practise and repetition. I have just published a series of four books of short fiction which have been all written by me. Like most writing I get better at it as I go along and as I develop my process, I also find I learn how to write better.
It was quite a revelation to write my first book with other writers. It was a huge learning curve and for me personally, the experience of sitting down and ‘fiddling’ with a manuscript with other people was the point when I realised that my brain would never be the same again. Not because it was made ‘weak’ by writing with others. Rather because I realised the writing ‘hand’ I had was not an independent, individual thing but a ‘dictionary’ of words which had learnt how to speak, and would never again be ‘silent’. It was this ‘silent brain’ that became the subject of my new book.

C2,"Philadelphia Avenue I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened the humidity thickened into a palpable prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. The last of the sunlight filtered into the low-ceilinged office buildings that lined Philadelphia Avenue. I was a little too close to the curb for the comfort of the pavement. I knew that even the best of us needed to move slowly. This seemed to be an area well known for pedestrian hazards. It was also an area of low traffic volume, so when one came upon a pothole one would be sure to notice it. I didn’t notice the first pothole; my thoughts were more focused on avoiding getting hit by another car. I could feel my body shivering. It was a cold October evening in Philadelphia. But I couldn’t have been more wrong, because as I walked I noticed the other pedestrians around me moving more quickly than I was. This was a new experience for me. For the last forty-five years I had been an orthodox walking commuter. In the fall of 1969 I decided to become a walking commuter. With the help of my wife Margaret, I bought a large shopping cart for my trunk and an inexpensive pair of walking shoes for my feet. I had intended to walk to work everyday in the same direction – one way. It took me several weeks to acquire the necessary gear. During the weekdays I walked slowly, about an hour and a half. On the weekends I had one goal: to reach the office on time, whether it was to visit a friend or for a social visit with another commuter. I would always park"
C2,"Einstein Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist and the chances are they’ll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias. As an academic he was also prolific and famous, appearing in magazines such as Time in the early 1950s. However, it’s his work as a psychologist which has become most famous, with the quote from his most famous work, 1905, “The greatest danger that the science of psychology may ever face is the fact that it will not be applied systematically, that it will not be applied critically”, ringing out to the world. Einstein was born in Breslau, a city in the Austrian Empire on January 2,1879. His father was Jewish and his grandfather died when he was 13 months old. By his early teens Einstein was already having visions of what he would become. At school he was involved in politics, being the editor of a newspaper and secretary of a debating society. He received his first scientific degree, an MBA from the University of Berlin in 1903. He then received a PhD from Berlin University in 1907, focusing on the philosophy of science. In the following years, Albert worked as a scientific researcher and in 1907 published ‘Falsifizierte Verbindung’, a book which questioned the validity of Freud’s theories. Einstein’s work as an authority in his field continued to develop during this time. He was also a psychologist in the public eye. He became a regular figure on the lecture circuit giving lectures on psychology as well as being the author of books. However, it’s at the end of"
C2,"Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need.
The first astronomical chart in existence was actually published in 1639 by Sir William Herschel, the eminent geographer and astronomer of that time. The chart is now held by the British Museum but is available on the Internet.
The first astronomical library was founded by the English Astronomical Society in 1680 and since that time the Internet has revolutionized the way scientists around the world collect, store and distribute information about astronomy. In the early days, scientists used to meet and discuss astronomy in small and noisy clubs. Today they meet in huge laboratories at very small distances from one another.
At present astronomers study the skies from both ground and space observatories. There are several different types of observatories. Among them are optical observatories, where light is focused on a small aperture to produce a picture of distant objects. Other types of observatories include radio observatories and infrared telescopes.
The Moon is the second most common natural object in the night sky after the stars. It has been observed from space many times, mostly by the Soviet Union and the United States.
The Moon appears to have two distinct phases: the inner part of the lunar night, the “apparent” phase, and the outer part of the lunar night called the “apparent” phase. This “apparent” phase gives the impression that the Moon is moving to the left, but in fact, it is moving to the right.

C2,Art In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique revolutionary shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago.  This has happened because the artist is a rebel. The artist is daring to change the way we look at things. This has happened because there is a great movement to see art and literature and music and poetry as the work of a master. Art and literature and music and poetry are seen as being outside any other kind of work. There is a great movement to say that all that matters is the master. But in this movement there are all kinds of rebels. There are rebels who are rebellious for their own reasons but who don't think that way. There are rebels who rebel against tradition. There are rebels who rebel against rules and conventions. There are rebels against anything which is not their way. If you think that everyone has to rebel against the art of his contemporaries you are not just being naive about art. You are not only believing the hype. You are actually believing the hype. If every rebel is equal in importance then you will not notice a great and important rebel but you will be very sure that a lot of little rebels exist. That makes sense. What if a lot of little rebels do exist? Why is that not surprising? Maybe that is the reason why you have to rebel against your contemporary. What is the difference between a rebel and a follower? A follower does not think that his way is the best way and he doesn't dare to rebel against the master of his way. A rebel is the only person in the world who doesn't think that his way is right.

C2,"Fashion Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point. In most cases this is indeed the case, as was highlighted by the late Victor Guimard, but most writers would claim that it is the middle period in the sixteenth century in which this trend was most strongly felt (Lavoisier, 2001: 18). The point is that, while the fashion for clothing as we see it today arose on the market, it had an underlying development that is not so easily distinguished. As a result of this development the market and mercantile traders also created clothes for the poor as well as for the market elite. This was a major change in society and led to the development of the idea of ‘society in fashion’, as we know it today. This is particularly true of the clothes of the bourgeois. The fashion for a particular style among rich people, as was the case in the sixteenth century, as well as among the bourgeoisie in the eighteenth century and throughout the nineteenth century, became more and more distinctively associated with social class. This is clearly shown by the clothes of the Rococo and Baroque periods, which were extremely popular among the bourgeoisie and aristocrats. While the Rococo and Baroque period had the benefit of the widespread acceptance of the bourgeois ideology of social equality, it has the disadvantage that there was no great market for fashionable clothes at the time, with the exception of the very rich. The trade in fashionable clothes was not yet established in France. For example, we find in the fourteenth"
C2,"Metals It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. This stone would have been a perfect candidate to be turned into jewelry. This has been suggested by some to be why the first humans wore beads, lapis lazuli, and lapis lazuli beads. The thought being that the stones were too large to be held in hand and so made an easy material to make jewelry out of. This notion has also been discussed, in detail, in the book, “The Art of Early Man” by Richard Lehner. The stone is called by the Greeks “aureus” which means white, and the Romans “agate” which means yellow. The use of lapis Lazuli for jewelry may have been so prevalent that it never needed to be ground. It was just rubbed onto a metal and allowed to come off again and again. We can get our ideas today of jewelry made from lapis Lazuli by using jewelry tools that existed at that time. For example, we have lapis lazuli cutters to cut lapis lazuli. However, the tools used to make jewelry with lapis is not entirely reliable. Lapis is quite brittle and is often chipped in the making process. For this reason it was recommended that beads only be made from lapis. However, the Greeks were quite fond of jewelry made out of Lapis Lazuli and could be seen wearing the beads around their neck. It may also have been possible for the Greeks to get their hands on lapis lazuli to make jewelry"
C2,"The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. I loved looking for places where I could capture the way light and shadows mixed to make a whole in the scene. I loved learning about the history of the place. As a result, I would often try to photograph the daily life around Vienna. It was easy to find a small corner where I could get a good look at the street scene and snap away. But it could also be hard to find something interesting enough to photograph. It was hard to capture an atmosphere that way. That was what interested me about the assignment in Vienna. I wanted to find a location that would allow me to capture the details of the city. I knew from past assignments that there was something special in the streets in Vienna around Christmas. There were some great street scenes that year, but I wanted to find something more. So, I decided to do something different. This assignment had been in the back of my mind for a long time. I had seen pictures and video from other assignments that photographers took there. They didn't seem to take any of the pictures that I had wanted to capture. I knew that I had to be smart about the assignment if I wanted to get a good result. The way I would approach the assignment would be to walk down the street, get a nice looking shot, get out quickly and get back to my hotel. But, I wanted to try something new. I decided to try and take a photo of the people outside my hotel. It was the only way I could be sure I"
C2,"Enough Sleep? Tiredness it is often claimed has become the modern condition. As the richer busier countries have grown so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings. However, with little understanding of sleep processes and its effects on performance or alertness and the rapid development of medical interventions for sleep disorders, insomnia and other sleep-related disorders continue to develop.
Many researchers believe the problem may have an ancient origin, probably arising out of early man’s need to compensate for his own deficiency of sleep. For example, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder, writing in his Natural History, reported the following, concerning sleep: “The Romans have always longed to see sleep, and they never seem to have understood why.”
Some recent studies have also suggested that early man’s need to sleep could have been related to the evolution of the body and our ability to adapt to the changes in the environment. Studies have shown that the human body has developed adaptations to cope with extremes in temperature (solar day or night) and seasons of the year. This adaptation has enabled an average adult to get some sleep over nearly all of the year (roughly 7–9 hours per day) throughout the various seasons and also helped to ensure that individuals did not go without adequate sleep even during the winter months. But, during the short months of summer a very few individuals may sleep only for a few hours or for some days at a time, while others sleep for weeks together during a single solar day. The adaptation that results, and has been described by many different researchers over the years, is referred to as ‘winter sleep’."
C2,"Air-conditioning There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer’s unusually high temperatures the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so in fact that at quiet times the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. The air-conditioning system is controlled to such an extent that its use during “peak periods” has meant that Cannons no longer has free parking spaces available to customers during afternoons and evenings. A system installed in early 2015 by company Triton is so complex that staff cannot even determine whether it is working or not. It is controlled remotely, so it can be switched off when staff are out or during periods when demand is particularly low. The fitness centre says there are no plans to turn the system off permanently. Staff are told only to use it during peak periods. But the fact is the gym has never had an air-conditioning system before. Even if it had, staff would be in the dark as to whether it was ever working. That explains why there is such a chill in the air.
Public transport Users of public transport face increasing problems with noise pollution. Over the last couple of decades public transport has become a very popular form of transport in the UK. But this popularity is only likely to increase in the future because of the low cost of journeys. But how long is that likely to last? In the summer months there are a number of factors that cause congestion, including weather related events and traffic lights. In summer traffic lights change more frequently in order to avoid clogging up the roads. That makes travelling in traffic significantly more complex for people who do not have cars. But it has not stopped the growth in demand for public transport. The number of"
C2,"THE WELL I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched eyes wide fist to mouth as I winched up the well bucket steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. My excitement grew and the bucket trembled as I pushed it out. “We've got the ladder,” I told you, “but we don't have a flashlight yet.” We had looked for them all over the house; in every room, in all the closet, in all the cellar and even in the attic. But there was none to be found! Had they all disappeared before we got here? Fortunately we were in a good deal of hurry because it was now very late and we had an early start for the train. When we heard your voice we all jumped, thinking that you were dead. Fortunately, it was all just a dream. If you were asleep, you would have awakened long ago!” What a nightmare! I had almost wished we had not gone at all. Perhaps the light would lead us to some clue. But we tried desperately. We finally had a flash of inspiration, the boys and I. I climbed back into the well, the others climbed in behind me and in less than two minutes I saw something very strange. I shone my light down into the dark well and there I saw it!” A glow!” “A light!” “Yes, yes. I think we found it.” “Not on your own?” “Certainly not.” Who saw the light?I couldn’t tell you who saw it first but I can say with some"
C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day. As he entered he immediately heard the click of the door lock and felt a momentary twinge of guilt but then remembered that it was his nature to protect his possessions, and that it was simply a means of guarding against temptation.
""I love you, Ralph,"" she whispered.
""I love you, too,"" Ralph replied.
He then looked about the room, but there was little to see beyond the shelves of books in their respective bookcases. At the center of the room there was a small table on which he saw a pile of bills which he had received on account of book sales.
Ralph was puzzled. He had never heard of a room without a window in it, but he did not believe it possible that a woman of her age would not have a window in her bedroom. He also did not believe it possible that she would keep books out of her bedroom and then turn to look out the window at night.
He considered this, then, for a moment and then set about putting his suspicions to rest.
There were two sets of curtains in the room. In the window, in front of the bookshelves, stood a glass-fronted curtain which, when open, would admit a little light. Ralph remembered from a past visit that this curtain was in a new condition when he last saw it, but that it could be easily removed by the push of a button. In the bathroom was a new white towel.
But then, it was"
C2,"Heritage The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously we feel connected to our personal heritage usually we know who and what our grandparents were and we will have heard stories about how they lived. But in terms of our national identity what do we do as a nation apart from our own personal story? Heritage allows us to do things like travel overseas to visit sites that have been important to us. Heritage also means that we can understand how our environment has changed over time. I think there are a lot of things that can be gained from looking at the past that are very important and can be incorporated into our future. The main reason why heritage is important to me is because I would like to see it more protected. The Heritage Act has set up a framework to protect England's historic monuments. To me it seems like the more we protect it the more our children and future generations will be able to enjoy it. For example, if we are to have a monument or buildings that tell the story of our country then it makes sense to preserve it as long as possible. It is also important that we have a national sense of identity. In my opinion it has become increasingly difficult to define our national identity. For example, some people don't even like to be called English. This makes it very difficult to create a common sense national identity. People often feel like they don't fit into one side of that identity. In my opinion, heritage is the common ground between those who are on the same side of the argument and those who are on the other side. This is why heritage is very important to me. For example, my grandparents always talk about how we have this heritage of farming, so when"
C2,"Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare’s play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. But as I look back on this production now I must admit that the decision was right and well taken. It was, and is, Shakespeare’s ‘greatest love story’, the one which shows the man’s greatest achievements, and most of all his flaws, through to his triumph at the end. I am a convert to Fearon and his magnificent performance of Othello. As Othello, he is every bit as dramatic and powerful as he is at the top of his craft as a musical director. To me, Shakespeare is now and always will be the best of musical theatre. Othello is a masterpiece.

C2,"The Wrong Country Uncle chose for them a package holiday at a very reasonable price: a flight from Gatwick Airport twelve nights in Venice the fairyland city in the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went together to the travel agency to make the booking the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast all of them learning Italian. The clerk said the group might all prefer Venice to Rome. They were travelling in October so Keith could take a job teaching English. And so the travel clerk asked if any of the group could speak Italian and if so they could go with them. The three Italians thought for a few moments then Keith answered that he would go. “You go”, said the clerk, “I’ll be left at the desk by myself”. He had never seen a European airport before and the sight of everyone else travelling in a huge flock together made him feel like a child again. The Italian group of eleven girls and one boy all seemed to be studying English as a second language. The girl was the oldest, a lovely mature looking young woman called Giorgio who looked after the four year old niece, Maria. There were the same four other girls all of the same age: Alessandra and Chiara the twins, and Vittoria, only five. The school group was made up of four boys: Alessandro, Giovanni and Marco, then a third friend, Matteo, a boy who was not an Italian but rather from Milan. Finally there was Stefano, the youngest, who was still studying English and had been working hard at it. Uncle Keith was pleased to find they all seemed to enjoy the holiday. But they had a problem. At the age of fifteen Matteo had to take his driving test, and the results were not due back until May, which"
C2,"Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal. It is a romantic scene. Perhaps even a true-life narrative of this great animal’s behaviour would be fascinating. Unfortunately, the true-life record of lions hunting for food is more interesting than romantic. There have been a number of films made on the subject in recent years. The most recent, and most ambitious, is called Lions at Midnight, directed by Brian Lynch (son of Brian Flinn, the director of Animal Kingdom, and the script was written by Brian Lynch’s brother, Simon). The film, which has only just started filming (which means, I’d guess, there will be a film about lions this year), is set in Botswana and features lions hunting with hyenas and hyraxes in an ever more inventive fashion. The lions are being fed by hyenas in large quantities, but the hyenas are killing their prey and eating it - but the lions are having none of it. They will not be fed by hyenas any longer. The film will examine these lions and their hunt as they struggle against the odds. There will be a special screening of the film at the Royal Zoological Society of England this weekend, and then the entire movie will be screened at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland for a limited run. As I am writing, the film has received great reviews. I suppose lions aren’t the sort of animals to go without attention. I’m guessing you’ll want to"
C2,"Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. The couple will spend at least 3 months aboard the Martian surface. Once launched, they will orbit Mars for a year, then land to begin a 200-mile (320 km) descent to Mars’ surface. They will conduct two missions. A second round trip, with a total lunar-based payload of around 40 pounds (19 kg), is planned for a year after landing on Mars. The mission will include three to five crew members: one to operate the spacecraft, one for science, and one to serve as the commander. The mission will last for nearly three years. It will include scientific observations, a series of experiments, and “tenderness tests”. The crew will also stay at a basecamp to help coordinate between the two missions. These missions should bring home the first evidence of life on Mars in 2 billion years. A total of 3,000 applicants were asked for. Of those, more than 1,000 were rejected. All applicants need to be 30 years old, or older, and be in good physical and psychological health. They also need to have a good education and be able to work on their own. Applicants must also pass an psychological test. They will have medical checks every few months to make sure they are physically and psychologically capable of the mission. The mission will also include psychological training for the crew, including exercises to prepare for the first descent to Mars and possible future missions. All applicants must be married, with a “"
C2,"Garbage in garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be. Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip. As well as the regular refuse and recycling collection, it is common practice for households to place a bag of rubbish at the entrance of their home on the last day of every month. Then the family will have to remember to put the bag at the door in future. This is considered to be an important gesture for a certain social status. However, is it really necessary? If so, why? If the family can simply throw all the rubbish they produce away, the entire ritual seems superfluous. On one hand, they could simply do this every month and not pay for the service. On the other hand, many families would simply throw the bag at the door. The choice between the two solutions is obvious. Why not make the family pay each month for this service? In this case there would be no need to collect the rubbish, so a separate lorry would not be needed. This way of collecting rubbish is called ‘garbage in, garbage out’ and it is often called the golden rule of society. The principle can be explained as follows. When there are people in society who need a service or have a habit of producing a lot of rubbish, they have to pay a premium for the privilege. People who do not produce a lot of rubbish may choose to put the bag at the door every month, since they do not need it any more. The principle works both ways and does not depend on how much or little rubbish a person produces. In the end, no matter how"
C2,"Goat Racing I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans hordes of people food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. I could see the gates, the horses and they’re owners standing at their stables, ready to compete. The owners looked like they were having a great time. There were two stables, Blue and Orange. Blue was really big. Big enough that the race was not held in his backyard. No, he didn’t have any fields or paddocks. There were only a few horses, some of them quite tall. There were grey-headed greyhounds, black-headed greyhounds, brown-headed greyhounds and so on. Orange looked a little tiny. But I have to admit that his race was the most excited one. I took some pictures. The race started at 12:00 noon. There were four greyhounds, one grey-headed greyhound, one black-headed greyhound and a brown-headed greyhound. The greyhound was greyish in colour. His colour is mainly black with a little bit of grey on the forehead. He had a white-ish white nose and a little bit of grey on his mouth. When he started he was doing well. I was about to witness the start of a great sport. The race was over in less than half an hour. The horse who won the race was a grey-headed greyhound. He had a really thick coat. He was about 30-35cm tall. He could run up to 8 km per hour. His owner really wanted him to win. He had"
C2,"0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. Moreover, even experts often exaggerate. This raises questions about the reliability of oral evidence. The following are instances of historians who have made claims based on oral evidence which the records do not support: Albert Einstein was a vegetarian for almost his entire life, though, according to Einstein biographer and journalist Jeffrey Rosen, he ate ham as a young man. But the Holocaust museum records his frequent eating of ham during the Holocaust, suggesting that he was a vegetarian. This claim is bolstered by Einstein’s autobiography in which he repeatedly describes eating “Ham” in his youth, including a discussion of it in 1943. Hitler knew, and was personally responsible for a widespread slaughter of Jews. Despite the evidence of actual physical record, a claim of this kind may be regarded as extremely doubtful. Claim: Hitler’s extermination orders were carried out by the SA, a secret SS group.""The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems.

C2,"'You don't take sugar do you? shouted his secretary not so much asking a question as stating a fact - as well she might because she had been making Lancelot cups of coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting such things was that he wasn’t normally supposed to be there.

As far as she was aware, he had just arrived. But even if she was right, the answer still wouldn't be appropriate.

As she was saying this to him, she heard the door to his office open and close, followed by his voice. She knew he had been talking with a customer, and that his voice was low enough for her to hear.

She quickly looked down to her feet and tried to ignore his comment, “Is that a good excuse? ‘I didn’t think you’d need sugar in your coffee'”

It was a bit much, especially after his wife had already made their own coffee the previous day - without sugar. She felt very embarrassed at his unkindness - to her and the other staff. She couldn't help but feel like she was just not quite up to scratch with the duties of being his secretary. And as he wasn't exactly a customer she couldn't say anything to make him feel better about it. But, as she looked up to the door, a light flashed on, and he said, “I know you have a very important meeting with a client at eleven - would you get your things and meet me there?”

It made her feel better. Even if it was only for a few minutes, the fact that he remembered her arrival and not her failings gave her some reassurance. She could still find a solution to the problem of her"
C2,"REMOVAL DAY With her children now grown widowed Susan faces leaving the family home. The van said Susan noticed ‘Removers of Distinction’ and indeed every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables and his team of helpers not so gentle. Susan was too much of a sentimentalist and she was especially concerned that the furniture would remain with her children when she left. 
  
 However, at the final farewell Susan took one last look at the house and in the dim, dark night with the help of Fred the removal man and his men she discovered, not for the first time, that the furniture made a sort of peace of mind. 
  
 But it has been almost a year since she has said good bye to the family home and as she now faces the new phase of life she feels the need to say her final farewell to the family home which remains a part of her memory. 
  
 So Susan’s request is simple: to ask only one thing of whoever, if ever, comes to remove our beloved property, let it remain in the house. 
  
 We were asked to remove the house because we did not fit in. We left a comfortable home for a cramped one which did not fit in. 
  
 But we were not asking for sympathy nor for pity. We were asking for a little respect. 
  
 We ask for the house to be left in the house which it has been, a little time to give it the attention which it deserves and then return it to its rightful place. 
  
 We also ask that you remember when you looked at the house, you saw all of life's joys and"

He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. He said he remembered that they had long arms and that they took over the world. ‘What would happen if the dinosaurs did take over?’ I asked. ‘We would eat them all,’ he said. 
  
  
  
 His enthusiasm at learning more about dinosaurs is infectious and he is a joy to have around at lunchtime. 
  
  
  
 We’re having a quiet time today at home in the sun. Here at work it’s raining, my colleague Karen and I have both been sick, and I haven’t been getting much reading done. And today our son and daughter-in-law arrived for our first day back at work after a two-month holiday. 
  
  
  
 On the surface, everything seems to be back to normal. But as with any home, there are little things that I miss, the way our son used to carry my keys around; the way my daughter-in-law would always sit close to me when I read books out loud at work; and the way my son would sit next to me on the sofa.

C2,"Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. The big male of the group, Cheney, was none too happy about having to share his territory with a stranger. To his horror, he realised the same thing he had long suspected: the stranger was the new alpha of the group. He was so shocked by the discovery he didn’t want to touch him at all. Cheney tried everything he could think of: he growled, he banged on the branches, he bellowed, he even shook his fist at the stranger – none of this worked. As a last resort, Cheney decided to turn to the most powerful tool available to him, to send a message to the stranger: “Leave me alone, I don’t want to be friends”, he read in the most persuasive manner he could think of. That was all it took: the newcomer, suddenly transformed, left the vervets alone and their leader returned to the way he was before. This story – like all vervet stories – is full of surprises. What Cheney failed to foresee was that the newcomer, the alpha, was actually a gentle giant with a kind heart and a lot of knowledge. After an unforgettable and unforgettable evening in which they all got to know each other better, they continued with the research with the same group of vervet monkeys as before. Who is the alpha vervet monkey of this group?

Answer: The new alpha vervet monkey of the group is the one who:

C2,"AESTHETICS By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. The theoretical system has to explain the existence of these works. This need to explain the existence of the works of art can only be met by a theoretical system whose first point of arrival is the physical, rather than the logical, sense. 
  
 The logical sense is for some reason missing from the analysis of the art, even though art in general tends to be treated as logic, and art in this sense is the study of art. 
  
 The first task of a theory of art is to grasp that it exists, as an objective reality. Not merely as something that may exist at a time in the future, but something that exists independently of that future; that is, that it exists now. From a logical point of view, that objective reality cannot be explained by using its logical properties. (The concept of subjectivity, as we will discuss shortly, gives a hint about why it cannot be explained.) Therefore, from a logical point of view, the logical properties of the work of art cannot be the subject of the theory. There are others who try to explain how the works of art can be so treated. But that explanation is a purely logical one. For it tries to tell us how art should be treated, not how it actually is treated. If we are to make a theory of art, that means we need to see the world as it is, not how we should see it if we have a theory. To be more accurate, our theory should"
C2,"Sand Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face gets in your sandwiches and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. Sand will only ever be sand.
However when it has a home it can be a fantastic addition to a property.
Sand gives a home the feel of a second home. For example an outdoor shower with a view over a sandy beach makes a home feel like it has a second home to go to.
Add sand walls to a swimming pool or sea garden to add a touch of luxury. When the sea goes off season sand walls give a sense of permanence to a swimming pool.
Sand can be used to make a concrete garden bench or a bench that can be used indoors. If you want to add a sand house in your garden the possibilities are endless.
Sand can be used in the home as a floor, floor tiles, patio areas and of course on a roof.
The list goes on and on. To see examples of how to use sand for your home check out the video on the video below.
Sand is both a good and bad friend for the home. If the sand is left to sit and the owners have forgotten to clean it in time the sand begins to look ashy, but also acts as an insulator. A home that is too cold will retain heat more efficiently than a hot one, and vice versa. If you want to create warmth in your home you need a heat source that is close to your body. If you place a heater on a surface that is covered in sand then it will heat up quickly but it will lose heat very quickly"
C2,"Art on TV Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details. On average the viewer is forced to pause and rewind the programme at least twice for this very purpose. The poor production values of some television programmes show clearly what a vast improvement a film with high production values could make. 
  
 The public should be free to enjoy the artistic work of artists without being forced to pause the programme or watch it repeatedly. They should be able to watch a programme on television without being constantly interrupted for adverts and information.

C2,"The Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews.
For example, in one film actor who spoke publicly about his craft (at least on camera) felt the need to publicly announce that he had been “made” in this way. A common phrase for a person who is in a certain position (like a politician) that they feel that their reputation has been damaged by this. In the context of that actor being a professional actor I would translate this as ‘made to look like an idiot’. I don’t think an actor needs to announce that he was made to look like an idiot and I wouldn’t think that it would help to improve his reputation. (This is not my opinion – I have met actor who say and write things about their own industry that are more than a bit silly or self-aggrandising.)
The Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt are also frequently expressed by theatre actors who know that they are a celebrity in their profession, but still they feel that they need to do their part and perform (a small, but important) role in the world they inhabit. It seems to be a way of ‘getting over the line’ (or ‘past the line’) so to speak.
And then there’s the Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt I am thinking of right now. They seem to be the most prevalent when a new actor is performing for the very first time in a play. Often there’s"
C2,"Work Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change. Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood and even among individuals who have won eminence there is often bitterness behind the fame. The future for a lot of us will look far different from the one we live and work now, and whether we like it or not, the work we do and the time spent away from our family is not going to change much. 

In the 1950s the average person spent 60% of their time at home. Since that time the proportion has remained stable at about 50%. We spend more time at home because of family obligations, but that is still true. In future we will probably spend more time at work, because of all the technological progress. We will be able to work longer hours and spend more time at home. This will allow us to take up new skills at work, so that they will be able to find a job for life. 

To cope with this change people should adjust their work-life balance. Time off would become more precious, as we would no longer be limited by our children's and grandchildren's education. For example, if my daughter studies for the bar we will take time off to go to university in another city. This was impossible at our time of life. Now we would do that without hesitation. Similarly, when my daughter gets married we will go away for a weekend or a week at the most. 

I believe that technology will make this way of living easier and more convenient, so that we no longer have to choose between work and family time. As a result, the work we do will become more important than the"
C2,"Language You and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth they will soon be exchanging words. 
  
 But it turns out language is more than just words, it is about making sense of the world that surrounds you. Every language has its own way of seeing the world and making sense of what it contains. 
  
 For example, how does one speak about the death of a loved one? In English we have a wide variety of different ways of expressing grief, but none of them can quite capture the depth of feeling that comes with the end of life. There is an old saying that a thousand flowers bloom where one is lost, but I doubt even a thousand would describe the overwhelming sense of loss that can come from the death of someone we care about. 
  
 The closest we have come to expressing that experience in English is via a poem called “A Dying Man’s Prayer” by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, published in 1872. 
  
 While not saying much it is an effective statement about what it feels like to lose someone who has been in our lives for a long time. 
  
 In English we do not even have a single word that describes the act of losing someone. We certainly do not have words to describe the loss of our emotional connection to our friends and family. 
  
 What is our loss like? 
  
 And what is the loss like to loved ones of those who have lost someone? 
  
 A great deal of research"
C2,"Kinetic Art Rejoice — the well-nigh impossible has happened: London’s austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not thankfully by some huge-budget mega-hyped multi-media extravaganza but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century. The show, which opens next week, is titled “On the Run: 50 Years of Kinetic Art”.
There are many forms of kinetic art, including drawing, dance, and video. The main attraction, though, is the use of machinery and motors to move objects. It is the visual arts that have had the most influence on kinetic art in the last half century, and Hayward is one of the major centres of this style of art in Europe. The show charts the development of this form through three phases. The first, from 1959 to 1964, saw the introduction of a huge number of kinetic exhibits at major national shows. The second, from 1965 to 1978, coincided with the beginnings of Britain’s new modern art scene. The third, from 1978 to present, focuses on “the growing recognition of the artists”, but also the idea that “in the early twentieth century, kinetic art, in its various forms, was seen in a very much restricted range”. It includes works by Keith Haring (“a giant of the British art scene”) as well as Chris Ofili (an artist who is now known mainly for his installation, but was influential in the development of kinetic art).
In some ways, the show is a classic case of the art world’s problems in responding to cultural change. The most obvious problem is that some aspects of the contemporary art scene seem to be in an unhealthy state of flux"
C2,"Paul Simon Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked with their destinies. It was the first rock group to really have a “sound” in the sense that it came in a wide variety of musical styles but all of them built around a simple and beautiful song structure with lots of guitar riffs and lots of vocals. This made it easy to identify the band’s songs by name and if you didn’t know any, you would probably have a hard time figuring it out by watching the radio. Rock was then also a very popular genre with plenty of variety to satisfy just about any listener.
There were several ways that I knew what Rock and roll was. We were in a high school orchestra and we had a radio station that played a lot of jazz and rock music. Most of the students had no idea what Rock and roll was so they thought it was a new way of music. Then there was rock n’ roll music. It was a new type of music that sounded like it was written by teenagers in the mid-50s.
It was quite a shock to our generation to find out we had heard a cover band playing songs by Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and the Beatles. We didn’t have much of a choice so we just had to learn to like it.
A couple of years later Paul Simon came into our class. I had never seen him before because he was always outside of the classroom talking to people. He looked like a very tall, thin boy who was really good at singing"
C2,"POETRY RECITALS At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. The poetry of the present, that of the past, is but the echo of the poetry of the present and the great poems are the echoes of the great thinkers who have written them. This is the rule which has made all literature so varied and so fascinating. 
--P.H.M. (Albert Einstein), Nobel Laureate in Physics (1942).Einstein's point was that poetry should be judged on its own merits, not only by the standard imposed by Einstein's time and its audience. It's often stated that poetry and art are judged against one another in competition, but that it is poetry's nature to out-think the other.
For example, many poets of the last two centuries have claimed to be influenced by the works of other poets. Take, for example, Langston Hughes, a poet who wrote about the plight of black America, although in a manner that often drew sharp criticism. In an essay titled, ""Who Needs Black Power to Write a Poem,"" written in 1946, Hughes noted that ""[l]egitimate poets, to make themselves useful, must make use of some great orator as a model and an inspiration. So far, I have not come across a great poet who has not taken inspiration from some great orator; but it must be admitted, I am too young and inexperienced to think of such a thing.""
To quote from an interview with Hughes, from the book, ""Poetry Is the Only Thing: Being"
C2,"CRYING Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness. As babies learn to cry to get their way they become dependent on their parents, in effect teaching them to self-soothe and also learning to self-soothe themselves by suppressing tears. They may also reflect the vulnerability of the infant, who, after all, cannot fend for himself. In this context it seems unlikely that crying has ever served no purpose. The infant will then learn to cry when it needs help, or when its comfort is threatened. It is easy to see how infants can cry if they are hungry or tired or afraid. And they do. If the parents won’t buy them food and water, for example, or if the mother won’t calm them, they will cry in order to get their needs met. This leads to the expression of helplessness by crying. The infant is, in effect, seeking help. This is also the reason that babies cry in response to being hurt by an object such as a slap on the rear, a sudden loud noise or a sudden drop in temperature. But it is also the reason that babies cry for more serious reasons as adults who feel like they don’t have their needs met. If an infant doesn’t feel cared for, it will cry. If you don’t look after it, it won’t sleep, eat or feel safe. And that is why it cries. In many animals and insects they cry because they fear for their survival. In human babies who cry, often"
C2,"Blogging: Confessing to the world Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into.
On Facebook for example – not your blog – you may be putting out a list of places to see, things you want to see etc. The list is not private and you may end up bumping into people you don’t particularly like, so might want to keep the list secret – or just decide you’re not comfortable with it?
What about your blog? It’s no longer the place to keep your friends lists. You’re much better off using your blog as a place to reveal your whereabouts to a select group of people, you’ll want to select this carefully so people aren’t ‘troubled’ by the location of your blog.
So Confessing to the World is all about letting the world see you where you really are, whether you choose to tell or not, and how you like it.
I confess: I live in my car.
Confessing to the World: I don’t blog in the car.
Confessing to the World: I blog in my car.
… or perhaps Confessing to the World: I don’t blog.

C2,"Food There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting. This doesn't do it justice though - if you like eating and this book makes you want to experiment with food in new and novel ways then you need to read it. As a cookbook it is pretty much perfect. The information is clear and easy to follow and, with a few minor exceptions, there are no unnecessary tips, techniques or recipes. All the recipes can be made without the aid of any specific techniques or ingredients that aren't mentioned. The illustrations are particularly attractive although the photographs would be better if they were a little higher quality. This is a useful and satisfying cookery book and will certainly please someone who likes to try new things. Review by Linda Richards The book looks great, its a nice slim book size, and gives easy to understand explanations of what each recipe is asking of you. It goes into further detail if you want to cook the food in the book but its not a daunting task to do it by yourself. The pictures are a bit low quality but hey, not a book to worry about colour or quality issues, its just a book. The book does state that they are all tested but they do not say tested for cleanliness or quality. Review by Michael S. The book does the job it’s written for and for someone who’s a little reluctant to cook because they think its not for them, I think this would be the book for them. It doesn’t take long and there’s lots of recipes to pick from and"
C2,"The Lure of the Kitchen When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is on the face of it an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long pressured menial - and badly paid. The only option for many of them was to become a shop steward or join the RAF. I think my reasons for wanting to go into the kitchen were the same as those of many men who came from a background that was otherwise unsuitable for a career in food. It was something that sounded like a good, fun challenge and also something that I would be able to combine with my studies at university. Cooking is a hard discipline to master and anyone who does it seriously wants to succeed. I have seen countless people give up halfway through a course just because it seemed impossible. It was always there somewhere in the back of my mind that I would be able to cope if I tried hard enough. The first professional job I ever got was for a bakery and when I look back at that time I can see the similarities with cooking. The first time I tasted bread I was not sure whether it was good. It had a strange taste - something that was unfamiliar to me. I wasn't sure whether it was delicious or not. It was a strange sensation. If you hadn't said to me ""this is bread"" I wouldn't have known the difference. If I had been offered a slice of it I would have just taken it and eaten it. As it was it was an interesting experience. I thought about whether I would go back to baking once I got my degree. I looked forward to the day when I would be able to go out there and bake bread. I could just imagine what I"
C2,"TIM RICE I was ushered into the young man’s drawing room an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class. What I saw first set my teeth on edge. It was a young lady in a white satin robe standing in an empty room. It was apparent that she was taking the opportunity to practice a dance that she had rehearsed with the help of the young man, who was on the phone to his boss. From where I stood, I could see that she was completely oblivious to the presence of any of those she was talking to. What appeared to me the whole scene was completely inappropriate in the extreme, and I was glad when the phone rang. It was my boss. “T. R. I’ve got something of real moment for you,” he said. “How’d you find out about her?” “It was my secretary who made the discovery. I’ve been out with a client and when I got back to my office the woman was gone.” “Where’d she go?” “I don’t know. There’s nobody in there but me. I was going to call her back on the way over here when the phone rang. She said she was going to play the dance with the boss, but I told her to let her. The dance is more important to me than an hour’s extra sleep.” “Didn’t you say you were going to bed?” “I did. There’s a"
C2,"Advertising on trial If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. The marketeers had no work to do. 
Weeks were spent planning the next advertising campaign to keep us busy in those early days. We had few ideas, although we did what we could to sell our clients on ideas they had. 
We had a system of ad evaluation by a select group of clients based on a few core criteria. We gave an ad an initial score of 1-10, the higher the score the better. This meant that an effective advertising campaign would be able to get to market by getting good results from an initial test run.
We thought that it was better for businesses to have an ad that had no chances of success, so it was common practice in our firm for clients to put their ads up as soon as they had a score of 1 or 2. The ad had to look like it had the ability to get good results quickly, or it would not be worth spending the client’s money. 
If an ad did not get the result that it was aiming for, it was quickly abandoned. There was no point wasting our clients’ money on it that had no chance of success. 
If an ad got the result that it was hoping for, it was an event and a celebration. It was a success. The client could not afford to give up on the campaign and it had proved that it could sell well. 
When a campaign gets good results, and there is a sense of celebration, we all drink champagne"
C2,"How to Write Poetry Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. The truth is, you just might not know what kind of poem to write next. For starters, you have to pick your poem. Then, you have to get that poem written. Finally, you have to find a way to get people to read and comment on it. If only it was that simple. 

If your poem has no obvious title or form, start with your main idea, its theme or a metaphor. Once you have a sense of what’s driving your poem, you can use this as the basis of your poem.
As an example, let's say you are writing a short story about a dog who wanders alone through the countryside. You might be thinking about the dog and the joy he experiences exploring the outdoors, or perhaps a passage in a famous book or poem might make you think of the dog's joy. It's hard to know what to write about an animal unless you know why you're writing about it.

You could make up a name for your dog to tie directly to the idea of freedom, adventure, or solitude. ""Freedom Dog"" might be a good title for an early draft of the poem. You might try something like: ""An Adventure Dog: Faced with the Possibility of Being Left Alone For the First Time in a Wilderness He Can’t Understand, He Finds his Joy.""
You might then go back to your poem to figure out what you mean by ""He Finds his Joy."""
C2,"Online Literary Criticism For All Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun? From the outset the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice however a certain amount of technical know-how was required at least in the early years. In the first years the majority of authors published their work in the print magazine 'Critical Review'. As the idea of Internet writing was gaining steam, some established literary magazines decided to publish their writers' works on the Internet. The first successful example is LitHub and the first two years of its existence have been the most successful for literary magazines. Other literary magazines, including the UK's 'The Review', 'The Criterion', 'The Quarter', 'The Magazine', and the US's 'Lambda Literary' also publish work on the Internet. The critical reviews are typically of a length of 20-40 pages. Each review is accompanied by the author's biography and the current book review policy of the respective literary magazine. Literary Magazine 'Lambda Literary', founded in 1999, is the most popular Internet literary magazine. It has been described as 'a site for everyone who likes the Internet'. It is currently considered the most active portal in the literary journal world. Every author in the field of the literary journal - from the published author to the complete unknown - is featured here on 'Lambda Literary'. 'The Review' published online in 2004, has been praised as 'the gold standard of literary Web magazines' by the New York Times. 'The Quarterly' was originally the title of the journal of the magazine publisher 'The Quarter'. It was renamed in 2008 to 'The Review' after the website launched in that name. The journal reviews literary magazines from all over the world and"
C2,"The two sisters kept Lily’s driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement) before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone. It was difficult to get her to give up her secret and the two sisters enjoyed their weekly outing together. Once, they had even gone over the top and driven over the bridge into a nearby park. When they went to get into Lily’s Volkswagen van that afternoon, the two sisters found a note from Lily. ""I've decided to give it away to a very happy person. I think it's time for me to get a real driving job. I'm too old to just put my hair up at home all day long. Thank you very much for letting me know you'll be watching over me. Love, Lily"" The two sisters were delighted that they had found a replacement for the old Bentley that had broken down while taking their weekly drives. It was now just a few weeks before the big sale. Chen didn't want to have the money spent on another car but he was pleased that they had decided to give the old one to a happy person. They had driven along the allotments as usual, admiring the beautiful flowers. There was a slight change in the air as the sisters got to the bridge. Just as they approached, a car drove over the bridge. It was the new car. It had been a long hard day for the two sisters. They were both over 70 years old and both had had a hard time getting used to driving a new car after having been driving a classic. The new car was very noisy and they both found it difficult to concentrate on the"
C2,"We are Talking Big Boots here. Really BIGTIME Boots. I stood in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money no object. I wore the whole truly cowboy outfit and if you had the outfit you might be a cowboy. So take that as your cue.
The outfit was made of cashmere, leather, wool, and even suede. I had the cashmere jacket made in Switzerland and made of top quality leather with suede lining. The shoes were a handcrafted leather made to last 100 years in high quality leather and calfskin.
The gloves were made of cashmere and the hat was handmade of fine ostrich feathers.
It was made to look authentic. That means I went back to my hometown in the United States made it there myself. That also means that I did all the work myself, had everything made by hand. I created this whole outfit that would have cost $2,000 a pair of shoes.
I know what you’re thinking. What did he eat to make his skin so soft? The answer is simple and he didn’t even know it himself. It was the finest quality beef that the most elite chef in all of Arizona could get his hands on. My beef was cut the day before, aged, and then dried for four days before being cured.
You all will love this outfit. You’re going to think it’s awesome. You’re going to want to be me.
And when you’re going to be me, you won’t believe the cost of this outfit.
I hope that this makes you want to become a cowboy. It makes me want to become a cowboy.

C2,"Love them fear them worship them human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports There's a bump bump bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird a bird of portent augury and divination. ""So if you're a bird lover this is the one,"" I suggest. ""I'll let you know what's about to happen,"" the bird coos back. The wren is a member of a small group of birds found in Britain and Ireland that call themselves ""cults"". As far back as the 1600s their singing and flapping made them famous. It was said that witches used them for magic. At the end of the eighteenth century this was the name given to them in Scotland. Their name in Britain is the wren, but I have a more English name. It might as well be the chicken of the house, because if I raise a chicken this is what the birds do. They raise chook-chooks in the greenhouse. It's a curious and amusing way to live, though a little tedious. Chook-chook is the sound these birds make as they fly past. ""I think you'll get very little in return for that,"" the wren says of me. ""Not much, but I've got some ideas of my own,"" I say. The birds live here and it's my job to get them food. It doesn't matter whether I catch the birds myself or deliver them from the nearest farm. My job is to give them something that will make them want to come to me again and again. ""I know where you can get fresh food,"" I say to the wren. ""It is at the market,"" she says."
C2,"Joanna’s Lessons Joanna MacGregor has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist. So why has she added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano? Even a member of that mythical species the completely tone deaf could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. The British-American piano teacher, who lives in New York City, has created a series of five lessons for toddlers called “Joanna’s Lessons.” They are designed to help little children develop a love of playing the piano, from a very young age. The instruction books are full of easy, fun and musical exercises for young pianists to develop their skills. Joanna offers these activities in a way that helps children acquire their skills not only in music but also in reading and handwriting. The books are aimed at young children aged two to four years old, however they are intended for children of different ages as well. “It is an effort to ensure that the concepts I teach the children are in a form that is appropriate for them,” the pianist said to BBC. This could make it difficult to teach the young children who are still in the nursery school or kindergartens, as they would not understand what the author is saying. But the books are not intended for children aged five years old, but four to eight years old. She explained that when they were younger, the children would listen attentively to everything they were taught, without having to practice it to any depth. By age eight, however, children can forget what they have learned if they are not taught something new. That is why Joanna decided to create the series of videos for the young children, to make sure that their minds are kept busy, so they do not forget the things they"
C2,"Every Picture Tells a Story Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer but also illuminating. Working on a script I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point. Here are a few ideas about how to structure a book for film without too much compression. 

It can be a good idea to outline a scene for the screenwriter with a scene-by-scene breakdown so that he or she can think things through in detail. You can do this by going over your outline with the scene writer and making suggestions about what things you might like to include but don't need to include (or at least, don't need to include in your opening scene) so that they are able to think through what they want to do. You can do this by going over your outline with the scene writer and making suggestions about what things you might like to include but don't need to include (or at least, don't need to include in your opening scene) so that they are able to think through what they want to do.
If the book has a few chapters and you are going to be changing the order of events throughout the screenplay, you'll want to make sure you give yourself some time to get a good grasp on the structure in the first place so that you can do that from the beginning.
If you've been going through the process of writing a screenplay and the whole thing is just slipping through your fingers as you write, you might want to ask yourself what the big problem is and what you could try to fix to get the screenplay going again.
It's a good idea to do a line-by-line edit of your screenplay to"
C2,"The Heat is On We’ve all heard of global warming but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives? Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. However, as far as climate change is concerned, most of the people, who talk about it, say that it’s a major problem that requires quick intervention. The situation is made worse by the fact that the economic gains of some countries, because of global warming, are much greater than those of others. The poor of some countries are going to face a more difficult time as the effects of global warming go further out. As a result, there may be mass migration of some of the poorer nations as those countries, unable to cope with the new climatic situation, find themselves pushed out of the world economy.

Even in our country, if global warming happens, it will have devastating effects on our environment. Already, people are being found to be allergic to the pesticides that are used in farming, and some even think that a world with no crop production will be a far better world. Some people, too, are finding out how poisonous the water in some parts of the country has become due to pollution. Many also believe that this new climate will make it much hard to grow and store food because the soil will be contaminated with toxic chemicals and bacteria. This will also mean that there will be very little shade for the people to rest in, leaving them with very little time to look after themselves.

As far as our own lives are concerned, this might have dire consequences. We humans are creatures of habit and as soon as we feel comfortable and settled in some areas of the"
C2,"Maps The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth’s surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. In this way a map shows the relationships between different parts of the earth. They are essential tools in a scientific research for several purposes. First, maps are used for drawing the shape and contour of earth’s surface and the contours are the shapes of the contours and the contours are also referred to as boundaries and areas which should be avoided. In addition, maps help with the identification of the areas of natural resources and other important data about the earth’s surface such as the coastline, mountain peaks and lakes. In addition, map shows the distribution and types of natural phenomena around the world such as the seasons and weather patterns as well as the geological features of the earth. These are essential tools for understanding and forecasting the weather of any part of the earth. Map is also used to show the history of the earth and its people. In other words, it is also useful for the investigation on history, geography and history. Finally, it is very useful for communication and the use of map is also vital part of our daily lives. For this reason, maps are widely used by the governments of countries and organizations and people of the world.
Mapmaking, a process of forming a map, has existed for thousands of years. It is believed that some of the first maps were made by the Chinese. However, the invention of the printing press has opened a new era for mapmaking. However, before the invention of printing press the mapmakers always used to draw, in"
C2,"HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. Not so in the US, which has the reputation of being a land of people who don't know much about great men. And yet, here the figure of this great man - who made the first circumnavigation of South America without modern propulsion - is widely known. He was the inspiration behind the Shackleton brand. He was a pioneer in the modern era of expeditionary travel, and an explorer of a kind not before attempted. In 1928, when he was 35, he set out from England aboard the Endurance, which could carry just six passengers, and was doomed almost to the end. When he left Australia on a four-year voyage of more than 40,000 miles through the Antarctic on his own, it took him 17 months. But he made it back. As the years passed, his courage, determination and courage shone through. And today, the legend of Ernest Shackleton is back. This week, American executives have been paying homage to him at a ceremony in New York City. I recently visited Shackelford House, in Long Island, where the company that bears his name has its headquarters. They're a British company, headquartered in Southampton, on the eastern side of the East Coast. A few years ago it had 50 people, but now, it has 400. They call it the 'Shackleton Lab'. It has three floors, and a beautiful new building, and lots of computers, and lots of research. The staff, which includes three people who"
C2,"Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain. In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. The combination of these new mediums has meant that today we are able to listen to music in many different ways, even without leaving our homes. In particular our musical world has changed through digital technology and the increasing popularity of the mobile phone. Today we take great satisfaction in making music at home, both on our own and through a wide range of services. This has resulted in a more creative and diverse musical world. We have become better able to interact with others in the music world. The music of today is more diverse, more global, more personalised more commercial and so more entertaining. The music world of today continues to evolve in ways both exciting and surprising. The music of today is an integral part of our daily life and a vital part of the modern day music world. A great deal of innovation is still to come, and we can look forward to a wide range of exciting and fascinating new music and related technologies in the future. Many music related developments now have huge appeal. Many new innovations provide the opportunity for new types of musical expression in a way that has never been possible before. This has a great impact on new music and a great impact on new musical formats. It's music that is really about being on the move and experiencing the whole event by the music and not the events around it. Some of the most exciting trends to emerge in music and music-related technologies include: i) The new music apps, both for mobile phones and other electronic media such as MP3 players,"
C2,"Holiday reading Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are of course intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people.
My favourite Christmas book is The Little Prince, a story of a boy growing up in a new world. All of his life’s adventures are contained in this short, beautiful book, each story reflecting a passage from a passage in the other. The Little Prince opens up a world that was largely unknown to us, and it gave us a wonderful insight into human nature. We are all just little children living in a beautiful, but chaotic, world. The Little Prince was a gift to everyone.
I love to read, especially books with a plot, but I also love travel books, stories that help me to see the world in a new and fresh way. I think travel books can help us to understand each other better, not just in faraway places, but in our own countries and towns, and even our local communities.
To keep you company in your reading endeavours, I have compiled a list of books that will keep you happy this summer. In fact, if the weather is good, you could even read outside!

The Secret Garden – Charles Dickens
It is a perfect summer read for a reader looking for a story full of adventure. One of my favourite parts of the book is that no matter what life throws at you, there is always a fairy tale to pick you up again. You can find out all about the Garden by visiting the website www.scottishtours.co.uk. I wish you a fun summer reading.

It is considered as part of art.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
C2,"Family Business ‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father with my brother Maurice in tow had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls’ school I attended. We sat in the car for a while and Dad said, ‘look I’m sure this isn’t a big deal – it’s just my business – it’s no good!’
I never knew what happened until much later and when I asked Dad he replied, ‘I took the car to a garage in Wimbledon. I knew it had a bad wheel, but I wasn’t prepared to pay a lot for a new car. A man called Denny asked how much I was willing to pay and I said ‘a thousand pounds a month’. Dad said ‘no that’s fine – you’ve got your money, but it’s no good!’.
I never had to worry about money or Dad ever again. I have a great deal of admiration for the old man. He was a big, tough man who knew the risks he took. He believed in his business and knew he could pay the bills. I am so lucky to have such a great man in my life. My parents had been divorced for many years at this time. The girls and I stayed with Dad for a while. We all had a great holiday and it gave me time to get into the business. My brother Maurice was much older than me and we were very competitive. He also had very similar skills to Dad. Maurice also took to my Dad’s business with great enthusiasm. He"
C2,"Vancouver In the last ten years or so hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver in western Canada. To relax in the evening residents stroll down the city streets and if you join them you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. Whether you're listening to a different dialect of English or French, or the local dialect, it seems that Vancouver is home to a million different languages. Vancouver’s diversity can be attributed to its many immigrants, the rich history of the city’s language, and, of course, its great weather. Although other English speaking countries such as Canada and the UK offer wonderful opportunities, these are often not available for the native speaker. However, if you are prepared to spend long hours in a conversation the results can be profound, at least for those of you who are not afraid of trying a foreign tongue. The languages spoken on the streets of Vancouver have become increasingly multi-faceted over the years and as a result the city has become known as a hotbed of languages from around the world. Let’s take a look at some of the most popular and well known. It is said that the language spoken on the street in Vancouver is the most varied, with people often switching from English to French, Arabic to Japanese or Mandarin, and even German to Russian. If that isn’t enough, most residents have also embraced a growing number of other languages such as Hindi and Spanish, and if you travel a few blocks you can even find people learning new languages such as Japanese, Arabic or French. As you might imagine, most of the city's residents are English speaking, but the city has more people speaking more languages than ever, as the Canadian government and international organizations now"
C2,"MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house I learned that opera is in fact only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That’s as it should be of course. It’s the music that sets the mood and the plot as well as conveying the emotion. There are however other factors which I think should be kept in mind too. Some of which include audience (audience size), cost, audience knowledge, audience diversity. Let me explain. If the Opera Company is trying to reach a bigger audience it can provide a larger theatre. If they want to give a more intimate feel then they should consider making use of smaller theatres. It all depends on the company’s target audience and how well they can reach them. So what is the audience size? On the National Opera I was part of an all women's choir and we had to be under 60. On some productions we performed in places where the audience was between 55 and 75. How do we know? When rehearsing all the small details of an opera, whether it's the lighting or the stage furniture, our voices start to sound smaller and we are always wondering how we will do on that performance. The same goes for the other choruses. We don't want to give away how small our voices sound because we want to impress the singers. The same with audience diversity. People have different lifestyles, different work schedules and so on. So we need to be sure that we can reach all these people. There isn't a single audience for all these people. In the end this is very important because each person who attends the show gives something. Even if he or she doesn"
C2,"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology 'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. It has roots in the French Revolution. But when it was first used by Shakespeare it might have been applied more broadly to seed, as in that famous speech in Julius Caesar where Cicero tells Brutus: 'Pluck up your own seed and plant it, if you want it. And if you don't want it you can always grow old and die and leave no seed, and then that would be the end of us all. What if I should die before that, I should plant no seed at all!’ The first recorded usage appeared in a speech by William Thackeray, on 16 August 1837. 'Broadcasting,' as a verb, appeared in the Daily Telegraph on 21 October 1888. 'Radio, as a word, first came into use as late as March 1894, and was introduced into the language by the Daily Telegraph on 21 October 1888. The dictionary of the word appeared first in 1885 by Joseph Stiles. 'Broadcasting,' as a noun, appeared in the Dictionary of Contemporary English Usage edited by John Webster, edited by William Thackeray and Herbert A. Harris in 1889. 'Broadcasting' as a verb means to convey information. 'Radio is an apparatus for transmitting sound in form of a telegraphic message through sound waves. It is also a form of communication.'

C2,"Writing Reviews Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner’s point of view. Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. They might last a matter of hours or a day or two, before disappearing from view. The editor has a responsibility to prepare and disseminate a review of the manuscript. This means that, for most reviewers, the review is only an early phase in a process which is more important than the review. The editors are more concerned about the manuscript than the reviewer. They look at the manuscript on a different level: how it should be read and what it should convey to readers. And editors know that what they will read will depend on the author’s judgement in the matter of the review. Editors also know that reviews can be used as a signal for readers as to what is good and what is bad in writing. For this reason, editors have a duty to read and, if they find that they agree with the reviewer, to recommend or not recommend to their students. They don’t know everything about writing and all about the book, they know only what matters. If they think that the author is wrong, they don’t need to give their reasons or justify their own decisions. They are writing to get published. What they will find or think is, as always, their personal opinion. Their students are expected to agree with their choice of publication and not to take their opinion as a given. So, editors don’t just give their approval, they act on the basis of their own judgement and, as such, they must be able to judge the quality of the"
C2,"Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941 despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst its alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. A series of successful movies (the first two were remakes of early radio serial productions by Orson Welles) made the book the film it is today. Many people thought that because of its subject matter and its long association with Orson Welles it would have a difficult time reaching the mass audience of films of its time. That was not the case and even today, seventy years after its initial release, audiences flock to see it. This is what makes the film such a cult classic. The film is not just a film of its times. It is an iconic one. The film was written by Orson Welles who is one of the few screenwriters to ever receive an Oscar for a movie. The movie stars Orson Welles himself. Directed by Orson Welles again. His other film, 1938’s Citizen Kane, is regarded as his best. But, regardless of that, the film Citizen Kane remains the standard by which to judge all subsequent productions. There are many good movies of that time that were never brought to light but, all of them had some element of Citizen Kane to them. There is the film’s setting. This is the most common element to be found in many films. People move through time. There is, for example, the movie The Godfather which is based in Chicago. There is, also, a character named Frank. The first time we met this character we did not know that he was really a fictional character. He"
C2,"England’s breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. In the eighteenth century, the term ‘breakfast’ was first applied to a meal eaten between 9am and 10am in the morning. The first mention of breakfast was in a 1686 letter by the physician Dr. John Smith to the king and said: “I beg Your Highness will command that you have a great abundance of a good and wholesome breakfast to be prepared as often as it seems to be convenient for Your Majesty.” The first written record of breakfast in England is from the seventeenth century where a reference to breakfast is found in a list of doctors in the Royal Library published in 1724. In addition, it appears on documents from the reign of Elizabeth, when it was used as an adjective as opposed to a noun. The first recorded usage of the English language to describe breakfast is in John Wilkes’ poem “The Great American Breakfast,” published in 1691. In addition, Wilkes mentions that a man who had read this poem to his lady was taken to the guillotine. A later source, James Hays’ “Historical Notes and Illustrations of the Breakfast System in England” also referred to breakfast in 1724. On this source, it was mentioned: “But, when she had seen him eat and drink, she was more delighted with it then with any part of the feast; and it was an honour to her that the King sent her his breakfast after the custom of his country"
